1. embed many certs in a json file makes json file not readable which is against common usage of json file which is to make the file human readable.
2. certs are required to be altered (insert new line escape) to satisfy json validation, doing this is painful and error prone.

I would suggest to do the following:

1. Use a compressed file instead of a single json file as a connection profile
2. The json file should be at the root of the package
3. The json file use url to locate various certificates
4. Url can be remote or local, if it is local, then the cert should be inside of the package relative to the json file, if it is remote, then cert get retrieved over https or http.

CDATA The default thread pool for the Java Chaincode Container is set too low. (this was introduced in 1.4.4).     This can be worked around by including a standard Java Properties file with the following contents.  ``` TP_CORE_POOL_SIZE=5  TP_MAX_POOL_SIZE=5  TP_QUEUE_SIZE=5000 ```  This should be called `config.props` and in the root of the compiled code.  For example if your contract in the gradle/maven build is in `src/main/java/org/example/MyContract.java`  put this file at `src/main/resources/config.props`     For reference:  RocketChat discussion == https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-java-chaincode?msg=D92LCRwatftEbSi6Q     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I think this will be fixed as a side effect of fixing FAB-2852 (see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8033/) and some other changes made in for FAB-2718.   Basically Java chaincode init() and invoke() return a Respose object, whose Status field is checked for SUCCESS.  I'll test it soon and see if it's still a problem.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA the JIRA items referenced by  ~sanchezl  are merged, is this still a bug? If it cannot be reproduced, please mark fixVersion as DUPLICATE and close.  Â   Thanks  ></body> </Action>

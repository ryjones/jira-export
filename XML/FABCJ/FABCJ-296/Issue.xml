CDATA There are situations where discriminating transaction intent within chaincode methods would be useful. One case I am encountering is where I have a method that calls getQueryResult and uses the returned values to make state changes. I find myself indiscriminately, and unnecessarily in the case of an evaluate transaction, calling getState to ensure re-execution at validation/commit time.  If I could call ctx.getStub().getTxType() or ctx.getStub().getTxIntent(), I could, without some roundabout means of determining intent, readily detect if the getState is needed.  I've assigned this work to myself as I am willing and would welcome the opportunity but will not start work until I hear whether this is desired by the team and broader community.  ></description> </Issue>

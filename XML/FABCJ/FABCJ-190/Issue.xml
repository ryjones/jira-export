CDATA When there is an error during java chaincode instantiation, a good error message is not returned to user.  A generic error is returned that is not very helpful to the user, for example:  "Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg timeout expired while starting chaincode mycc:1.0 for transaction"  or  "Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg transaction returned with failure: Index: 0, Size: 0"   See chat in fabric-java-chaincode for more details.     ></description> </Issue>

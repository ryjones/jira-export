CDATA tl;dr; Complex Path and Intergation tests - cross implementation langauges; does the Node.js contract api behave the same as the Java for example.  From  ~nkl199 : Enforcing common testing across chaincode types by use of cucumber: * New 'chaincode-test' repository that contains  # Feature files dictating the tests to run # Steps that use the CLI to deploy and interact with chaincode  * Chaincode repositories pull the chaincode test repo and provide:  # The chaincode to deploy (node/java/other) # Bespoke steps that are required for interacting with the chaincode under test if a common capability is not possible # Chaincode build process pulls the 'chaincode-test' repo, runs all features with the provision of chaincode-type resources - Estimate 1 person week for technical spike - Estimate 2 person weeks for completion following successful technical spike This should eventually be used for go-chaincode too  ></description> </Issue>

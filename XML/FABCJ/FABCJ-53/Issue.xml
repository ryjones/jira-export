CDATA When protobuf definitions are updated in {{fabric-protos}}, an automated build process should be triggered to compile the protos to Java and, depending on the type of build, publish the generated artifacts to the appropriate maven repository. The {{fabric-protos}} repository will not contain the generated language bindings.  Merge builds should be published to the snapshot repository, while released versions should be published to the central maven repository.  It should not be possible to merge a CR to the {{fabric-protos}} repository if compilation of the protos to Java fails.  ></description> </Issue>

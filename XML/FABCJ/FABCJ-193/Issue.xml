CDATA Currently when an error is thrown from node chaincode only the error message is being returned. This is an issue when you want to provide additional information in the error thrown.  For example, when defining a custom error class that extends on Error to contain additional information, this additional information is removed on response to a call from the rest api to invoke a transaction.  A use case for when you would want to provide additional information in the error is for multi language support where you would provide an error code to then be able to translate the message to the desired language.  ></description> </Issue>

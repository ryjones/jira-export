CDATA Hi Ramesh,  Unfortunately this isn't an issue with the chaincodes, but with jitpack, see:  https://github.com/jitpack/jitpack.io/issues/3973  If this is continually being hit, one solution would be to move jitpack to bottom of the list of dependencies in the offending build.gradle. We don't have plans to do this soon, as ultimately we need the jitpack fix, so closing for now  ></body> </Action>

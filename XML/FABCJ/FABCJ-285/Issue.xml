CDATA I have the following docker setup:  Single organization: (one peer, 2 orderers, 1 CouchDB)  I'm trying to make a query that should return 150 records,  The query is as follows:       {code:java} "{\"selector\": {\"projectId\": \"%s\",\"data_type\": \"debt_service\"}, \"use_index\":  \"_design/pocServicesDoc\",\"pocServicesIdx\" }" {code} The query is using indexing that is correctly installed on the db.      The query works, the problem (logs attached) is that the response from the CouchDB instance to the peer chaincode instance took 43 seconds. This is the time between `ChaincodeInvocationTask` log entries that correspond to `GET_QUERY_RESULT`.  The less I ask ^log_fetch.txt  ^network.zip  for (records), the quicker the response will fly so to say.  The same behavior is present on different machines (8GB RAM, 16GB, 32GB machines with 6 i7 CPU cores).   The network setup is a copy of the first-network from the samples, also attached.     ></description> </Issue>

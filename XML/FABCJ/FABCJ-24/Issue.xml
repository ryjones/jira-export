CDATA When couchDB is used for the world state store, it is possible to run a query against all documents, however, these queries will result in a full scan of the couchDB documents and is inefficient. From a reproducible test, based on 8k documents and 10 concurrent query requests, couchDB was observed to take in excess of 8 seconds to return the query response.   After indexing the database to match the query being run, this time lag dropped to the millisecond range. Indexing is also mandatory to support returning queries in a sorted order.   Chaincode developers/deployers can define their own indexes if they have access to the couchdb system but in many cases access to couchdb is going to be totally restricted especially where a service provider is providing a hyperledger fabric service  Chaincode developers are ideally placed to determine the type of indexes required based on their application and as such it would make sense that the chaincode have the ability to create/manage indexes for their application.  The proposal is for some API capability in the Shim which allows the ability to create/manage indexes specific for that chaincode application.  ></description> </Issue>

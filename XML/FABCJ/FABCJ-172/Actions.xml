What do you think?" created="2019-09-23 15:07:03.0" updateauthor="heatherp" updated="2019-09-23 15:07:03.0"/>

CDATA Unable to access the link locally with wget or from the browser, and this error is occurring after accessing the file build.gradle. I am thinking maybe the network issue which i have to wait on or maybe the invalid link.  I suspect the `./gradlew build` is not really accessing the link when i ran locally.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When I access the URL I get a 404, which I would expect as not all the repos have all the dependencies. However the error below is a 522 so I suspect that gradle is being mislead by this return code.   Gradle does cache dependencies locally - I cleared out the cache to double check.   ** > Could not GET ' * https://jitpack.io/junit/junit-dep/maven-metadata.xml * '.

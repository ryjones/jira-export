CDATA If it's any use, I've been using fabcar to try out the new contract stuff, and to compare the old style chaincode to the new model.  Old chaincode is here ->  https://github.com/jt-nti/fabric-samples/tree/java-fabcar-chaincode/chaincode/fabcar/java   New contract is here ->  https://github.com/jt-nti/fabric-samples/tree/java-fabcar-contract/chaincode/fabcar/java  (contract is still more of a work in progress and may sometimes depend on unmerged CRs at the moment)  ></body> </Action>

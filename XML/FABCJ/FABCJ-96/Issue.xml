CDATA Add support to build java chaincodes with gradle through the kotlin DSL:  https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html   It has reached 1.0 a while back and the DSL has been embedded in the default gradle distribution since 4.1.  Currently it tries to build the chaincode through maven, since the *build.gradle* file can't be found. When using the DSL, your build file is named: *build.gradle.kts*.     ></description> </Issue>

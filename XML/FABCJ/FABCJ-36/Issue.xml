CDATA It would be useful to be able to specify what error responses can be expected from transactions, in addition to parameters and the return type which is currently supported. This should also allow the contract runtime to populate error payloads in a similar way to success payloads.  Could possibly do this by extending theÂ Transaction annotation, adding a new "TransactionError" annotation of some sort, or some other way. Also need to think about how these errors would look in the metadata.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I experience the same problem with *fabric-chaincode-shim:2.2.0*. Moreover, I cannot simply override *newChannelBuilder* because it's final and I cannot implement my own *Chaincode* as *ChaincodeBase* (as I did in 1.* versions) because *InvocationTaskManager* depends on *ChaincodeBase*. So, the best solution would be now to copy the whole package and maintain it on my own which is of course not the best solution. Any suggestions?      ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu You right.   ~sambhavdutt  Its look like network problem during job run. I think rerun of the job will fix it. Right now plugin in question downloadable from my local machine, at least.   This is reason we try to install as much as possible plugins in fabric-javaenv image during image build and not during chaincode install, better if this happens during image build and not during chaincode instantiate.  sdkman is package used to install specific versions of gradle and maven in short and easy way, not connected to java sdk in any way.   ></body> </Action>

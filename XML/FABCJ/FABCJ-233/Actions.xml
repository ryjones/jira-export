CDATA Dear Ramesh,  as mentioned before we cannot expose these user and passwords outside the secure maven settings files in Jenkins.   These user and passwords combination are already present in fabric-settings.xml settings file.   We also have these store as a credential called "fabric".   Can we run the needed tasks by using the settings files that already exist in Jenkins?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Netty-tcnative library required to run grpc-java with TLS and not compiled to platform mentioned above.   In addition, we need platform specific build scripts, because luck of support for java-testcontainers library and gradle-docker-plugin for Z and Power.  Z and Power lack support for protobuf and grpcs compiler as well, so generation of protobuf files should be ignored as well.   Netty-tcnative build should be conditional, dependent on platform.  In addition, netty version and gradle version should be upgraded to whole process to work.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a developer of contracts, I need to know who to specifiy the classes that will each be a contract instance and make up the chaincode.   Also I need to know which is the default contract; such that if a namespace is not used on invoke this is the one that is used.      Node.js uses a `module.exports.Contracts`, Java could use pure annotations or extensions to an interface or class.   ></description> </Issue>

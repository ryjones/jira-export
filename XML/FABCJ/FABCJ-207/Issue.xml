CDATA The java chaincode integration tests need refactoring, and this is part of a larger issue with testing in general across sdks/chaincodes (see FABN-1390 and FAB-16744).  There is too much reliance on the java sdk in the java chaincode integration tests, which should be removed and refactored, under this test task.

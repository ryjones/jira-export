CDATA  ~muralisr  The reason the Java chaincode unit tests were disabled was that it was causing a 100% failure rate for the fabric verify and merge jobs for z and p.  We would like to have z and p eventually vote for the verification of the fabric jobs.  It's been a struggle. :)  I have been trying to get the Java SHIM fixed for z and p as far back as last September.  I think that we should do everything we can to get Java chaincode working on z and p for v1.0.  If it's determined that the "fix" for this involves more time and effort than expected and cannot make the v1.0 cut then this is understandable.  We should at least make an effort to make the v1.0 cut.   ~sanchezl   ~mastersingh24   ^^^  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm not sure which approach is being taken to solve this, but I'll just remind you of the two approaches that I was looking at in the past:  1. Patch tc-native dependencies to work on Z. (not sure how comfortable people will be about be about patching crypto libraries)  or   2. Move to Java 9+ and use ALPN. (more future proof, if performance/compatibility holds up).   ></body> </Action>

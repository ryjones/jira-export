CDATA Due to issues with building the Java SHIM while generating the hyperledger/javaenv Docker image, CR-2807 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2807/ was implemented last November to bypass the Java SHIM build/installation for z Systems and Power.  The patch was meant to be a temporary measure.  The purpose of opening this issue is to track the progress of fully implementing the Java SHIM within the hyperledger/javaenv Docker image for z Systems and Power.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA fabric-contract-java currently has a group ID of org.hyperledger.fabric-chaincode-java and an artifact ID of fabric-chaincode-shim  For consistency it should have a group ID of org.hyperledger.fabric along with both fabric-contract-java and fabric-gateway-java  Now that it also contains the higher level contract api, it might also be useful to change the artifact ID?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The below line is expecting {color:red}"hyperlerdger/fabric-javaenv:amd64-1.4.2"{color} image https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L512 so, when we test java chaincode related tests in the k8s environment, the test is failing while instantiation is happening as it is trying to pull the above said image from Dockerhub where there is no such image available.   For the ccenv image I see the tag is updated as latest https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L488  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I can define a transaction function in my contract class as follows: {code:java} @Transaction public void InitAssets() { Â   // Do something  } {code} This function does not have a Context parameter. It compiles without error, but the chaincode fails to instantiate with error: {code:java} Error: could not assemble transaction, err proposal response was not successful, error code 500, msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 1 {code} It was not easy to find out why the chaincode failed to instantiate.  I attached the sample contract code.  ></description> </Issue>

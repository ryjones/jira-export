CDATA Copied from description, originally added by  ~meiblorn    Also it's not obvious for new users that they need to provide path to chaincode sources instead of prebuilt jar file or, for example, .tgz archive.  Please, provide description about that somewhere in docs and it would be ideally if you mention about that in javadocs: {code:java} /** * The location of the chaincode. * Chaincode input stream and source location can not both be set. * * @param chaincodeSourceLocation * @throws InvalidArgumentException */ public void setChaincodeSourceLocation(File chaincodeSourceLocation) throws InvalidArgumentException { ... }{code} {code:java} /** * Chaincode input stream containing the actual chaincode. Only format supported is a tar zip compressed input of the source. * Only input stream or source location maybe used at the same time. * The contents of the stream are not validated or inspected by the SDK. * * @param chaincodeInputStream * @throws InvalidArgumentException */  public void setChaincodeInputStream(InputStream chaincodeInputStream) throws InvalidArgumentException { ... }{code}  ></body> </Action>

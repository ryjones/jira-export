CDATA If you build a custom `hyperledger/fabric-javaenv` image that uses a non-root user - a common security requirement for containers - the Java chaincode build process fails to work.  This is because the chaincode package contents are copied into `/chaincode/input` as root, but the build script is run as the non-root user.  We need to copy the files into a temporary directory and build from there. This is what Node.js chaincode does already today.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, {{ChaincodeBase}} class uses an {{StreamObserver}} to receive grpc messages from peer and operates an instance of {{Handler}} class to handle the messages. In additon, {{Handler}} currently uses an {{FSM}} to handle a message, which will be removed soon. The removement of {{FSM}} in *fabric-chaincode-java* is currently blocked by the corresponding refactory in *go-shim*. The dependency on {{Handler}} brings some meaningless work when adding unit tests for {{ChaincodeBase}} since some parts will be remove soon. So extract anonymous inner class {{StreamObserver}} into {{ChatStream}} to remove {{ChaincodeBase}}'s dependency on {{Handler}} s.t. # {{ChaincodeBase}} will not be affected after {{FSM}} is removed in {{Handler}} # {{ChaincodeBase}} can be unit-tested more easily # reduce loc of {{ChaincodeBase}} and increase its readability  ></description> </Issue>

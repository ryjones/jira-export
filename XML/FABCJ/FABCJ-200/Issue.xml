CDATA The new Java contract model allows you to define transactions using the `@Transaction` annotation however, since methods can be overloaded in Java, it is possible to end up with more than one transaction with the same name. Similarly the `@Transaction` annotation now allows a custom name to be specified which could also lead to duplicates.  Â   It looks like the last transaction to be processed when adding a contract is the one which then gets used when the transaction is run, which could be confusing. There should be an error when the contracts/transactions are processed.  ></description> </Issue>

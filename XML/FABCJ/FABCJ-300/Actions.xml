CDATA Fabcar hasn't used shadowJar since FAB-6415 The 1.4 branch still seems to use shadowJar  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/fabcar/java/build.gradle#L7  You could also package the chaincode jar(s) instead of the source, which avoids the need for a build when instantiating  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~conanoc   The 2.1.1 tag of fabric-samples does not include the shadowJar plugin either.  Can you check the contents of your CDS file? The shadowJar build should only run if there's a gradlew file in there as far as I know. (See  https://github.com/jt-nti/cds-cli  for a few options for looking at CDS files.)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As far as I can tell, the samples will only work if you build the projects and package the resulting jar(s), instead of packaging the chaincode source files.     Ideally fabric should stop supporting source files in chaincode packages at all however that would probably require an RFC  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs  (unofficial feedback on dropping support for source files in chaincode packages has been positive so far)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Baohua,  To answer your questions :-   1) How can CI push to dockerhub without username/password ?  Just like this is done for fabric-docker image release via  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-app/job/fabric-app-image-release-docker-ppc64le/configure-readonly/   pass relevant values to variable from here  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/Makefile#L108  which would assure arch. specific docker images are published.  2) And how can CI decide when (should be only for release or merged) to push?  We should probably update *IS_RELEASE* tag as *true* whenever we plan for a release which is set here  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/Makefile#L20   To summarize we should be creating a cello-release-*$ARCH* jobs under  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/cello/  which should be executing following commands :-  make docker  make install  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks!  1) That means the CI need to know the docker hub username/password?  2) Dockerhub actually supports building image with specific tag by detecting release tags.  ></body> </Action>

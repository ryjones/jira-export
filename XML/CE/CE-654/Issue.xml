CDATA Cello code version : latest code  OS : Ubuntu 16.04     ></environment> <description><! CDATA After I set up a cello service with latest code, I tried to add a new k8s agent. I gave all the inputs required by cello , the click submit button.   From the UI,  I can find my new agent added successfully .But seems the k8s config file was not uploaded to server. Here is the process how I found this bug.  step 1: query the agent info via api `/agents`                Result : I can successfully get all the agent info. from the info, I can get the config file link  step 2:  access the config file link               Result:  It told me the file was not found on the server  ></description> </Issue>

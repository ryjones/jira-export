CDATA  ~baohua  Here's what I plan to do, update cello-baseimage to include mysql-packages and come up with +*hyperledger/cello-mysql*+. Since neither ppc64le nor s390x supplies mysql docker image at this moment.  Would request to share your thoughts on the same.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I checked the file, and seems the mysql is only used by hyperledger blockchain-explorer.  I think we may contact the blockchain-explorer dev team first to seek their comments?  How do u think?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~harsha544 , i think u can ask those maintainers at  https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.rst.      Btw, i also believe providing some mysql image at dockerhub for non-x86 platform is a good idea.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA after review it seems that the following change in src/agent/docker/docker_swarm.py will do the detected work correctly .   server_swarm_cluster = client.info() 'Swarm'  'Cluster'  'ID'  if server_version.startswith('swarm') or server_swarm_cluster != '':  BUT it must be noted that : * the cello dashboard does not make difference between single or swarm and does report both as "DOCKER" in type  * Deployment of a chain on swarm machine is handled on the single node not on the swarm cluster (on swarm a docker-compose will not do , it should be handled through docker stack deploy (with a docker-compose V3 file) )  I'm fixing the detection the the complete deployment over swarm cluster (eventually to be targeted for Fabric 1.0 ?)      ></body> </Action>

And the deployment should happen on the swarm cluster with v2 in old swarm code.  Not sure the latest swam change the behavior? Then we will need to update the compose file to v3 version.  Feel free to go ahead~  ></body> </Action>

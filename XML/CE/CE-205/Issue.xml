CDATA The following make variable declaration doesn't resolve as expected  i.e *BASE_VERSION* *?= $(ARCH)-**$(VERSION)* should have been expanded to  BASE_VERSION = ppc64le-0.8.0 , hence tweaking it a little bit to *BASE_VERSION=$(ARCH)-$(VERSION)* which would by interpreted well and would works as expected.  ></description> </Issue>

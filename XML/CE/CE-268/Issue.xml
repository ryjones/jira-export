CDATA _ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply" aws.yml_ seems to fail when using any region other than us-east1, does not allow you to specify a non-default VPC, and always uses the first subnet. # By default, this picks the default VPC. The VPC ID should be configurable. # By default, this picks the first subnet in the region. The Subnet ID should be configurable. # By default, the AMI ID is hardcoded with a _us-east1_ ID. _ec2_ami_find_ is already being called, and will return the region-specific AMI ID for us. FYI this ID is being set as a fact (_ubuntu_ami_id)_ but appears to be unused.  ></description> </Issue>

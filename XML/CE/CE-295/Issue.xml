CDATA The dashboard will check the cluster health status after 5 seconds when the cluster was deployed on the docker agent. the time is not enough for vsphere host  to deploy the cluster. so, I change the time to 60 seconds.  it is maybe more longer in the K8S. I think we can enhance  health checking, for example, we can add health checking on the list function, it is in modules's cluster.py     ></description> </Issue>

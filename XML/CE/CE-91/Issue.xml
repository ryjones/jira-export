CDATA As a  blockchain network administrator  ,using the  graphical user interface of "policy manager", I should be able to create and enforce policies for the organizations/users of my blockchain network and  monitor the same , so that I could adhere to the business and compliance rules .        *Note*: We may have to create a policy manager app/module  . Potentially we need to integrate the same to cello . Policy management is an area by its own and involves  actions such as policy creation , enforcement, monitoring  and updation . Another option is to have a standalone policy manager , because some cases policies may be independent of  deployment .           ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu  Request you to create new jenkins jobs for ppc64le & s390x under  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/cello/  . With naming convention as `cello-release-$ARCH`  In build section of those jobs only these commands will be executed, we can leverage existing nodes/servers utilized for fabric for publishing the images.  make docker make install  Which should publish images to :-   https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-baseimage/   https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-mongo/   https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/cello-nginx/   FWIW, we would need same credentials similar to  https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledger/  inorder to publish the docker images  ^^^  ~baohua   ></description> </Issue>

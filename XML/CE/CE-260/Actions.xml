CDATA  ~baohua  :- Here are my thoughts about the following components :- * baseimage – The tagging has to be manual process once the tag is in it can be pointed to  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/dockerhub/baseimage/Dockerfile  . So there's a necessity to create a new one. * engine – Need to revist cello codebase to understand about engine components. * user-dashboard – Since this doesn't relay on cello-baseimage, this needs to be a manual process again. i.e create tag point it to  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/dockerhub/user-dashboard/Dockerfile  * operator-dashboard - Need to revisit cello codebase. * watchdog - Need to revisit cello codebase. * mongo –  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17569/  * nginx -  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17569/   ></body> </Action>

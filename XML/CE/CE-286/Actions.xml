CDATA Hi  ~LordGoodman  and  ~allenyang ,  I'd like to know the design on how do you go about implementing the code to deploy Fabric to a Kubernetes cluster. As I understand it there are three solutions existing in the Cello source codes.     Solution 1: * Use src/agent/k8s where deployment is via shell scripts  Solution 2: * Use src/agent/ansible where Ansible is used  Solution 3: * Use src/agent/k8s-operator where Kubernetes Operator will be used (No codes yet)     I'm asking because I would like to help in implementing it and so that our efforts can be harmonized.  ></body> </Action>

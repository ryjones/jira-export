The only way to perform a chaincode update via command line, currently, is to ssh into the master node and run it from there. Simplifying it to a single ansible play would be helpful." priority="4" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-05-25 19:40:22.0" updated="2018-05-31 01:36:23.0" resolutiondate="2018-05-31 01:36:23.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="30665"/>

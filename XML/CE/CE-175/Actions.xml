<Action id="40903" issue="23972" author="tongliofcary" type="comment" body="the behavior run against a cloud is entirely based on the cloud modules. for example, if you try to create a vm on openstack cloud, if the vm with the same name already exist, then it will use that vm. but in aws, it works very differently, it does not matter if a vm with that name already exists, it will always create another one. so the behavir can not be really controlled by ansible agent. also, each run create brand new set of certificates. What can be improved is that we can check the particular certificates directory and see if we need to recreate, but that can be a problem when peers and orderers added. It will be quite a big deal and I do not think cryptogen currently supports it." created="2018-02-27 04:26:27.0" updateauthor="tongliofcary" updated="2018-02-27 04:26:27.0"/>

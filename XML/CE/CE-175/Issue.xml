CDATA Let's say that you would like to modify the Ansible configuration very slightly, and re-provision. Just to add one new peer container.  Here is an observation about running Cello Ansible a second time.  Notice that each peer docker container has these volume mounts:  "HostConfig": \{ "Binds":   "/var/run:/host/var/run:rw", "/opt/gopath/bc1st/fabric/run/keyfiles:/etc/hyperledger/allorgs:rw", "/opt/gopath/bc1st/fabric/run/keyfiles/orga/peers/peer1st-orga.orga:/etc/hyperledger/fabric:rw"  ,  When you run Ansible again, it deletes and recreates those directories. The Bind Volume is lost. The directory /opt/gopath/bc1st/fabric/run/keyfiles is deleted and recreated, however the docker container does not see the new directory. This may be an expected result for Docker.  At least one solution might be to restart the container. Currently Cello Ansible is not doing that.  Next,  There could be additional problems involved with "Provisioning more than once". It would be helpful if the documentation specifically addressed this, having a section about running Ansible multiple times. Is this supported, what issues might occur, if any. Will the blockchain be affected? Could it be done in a live production environment?  Â   ></description> </Issue>

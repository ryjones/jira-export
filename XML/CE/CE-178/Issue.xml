We need to add a flag to indicate if the public IP on VM is needed. Public IPs should only be allocated/requested when the flag set to true. The default should be true as well." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-11-20 20:06:02.0" updated="2017-11-22 01:38:45.0" resolutiondate="2017-11-22 01:38:45.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="24066"/>

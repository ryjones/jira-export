CDATA Simplified steps to replicate: # Provision a CELLO-MASTER  a  and a CELLO-WORKER  b  nodes # Create a host and a chain # Decommission the current CELLO-WORKER  b  and provision another CELLO-WORKER  c  node (Note that at this point  b  and  c  have different IP addresses) # Delete the chain # An error is displayed with a message: "Failed to delete cluster". (see attached:  cello_delete_chain_error.png)     Expected behavior: * Deleting a non-existing chain should result into the deletion of that chain in CELLO-MASTER * The display should be refreshed with the delete action reflected  ></description> </Issue>

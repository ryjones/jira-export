This UI library is Encapsulated components for vue, so it's very easy for development, at least better than currently based on jquery. And document is very detailed. 2. If we want to change to SPA, it's will very quickly to use this library. 3. Better user experience. 4. Currently is also very hot font-end frame, and Get started quickly. For better development later, I think we need change front-end frame.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="57031" issue="37330" author="tongliofcary" type="comment" body=" ~tkueda this is indeed an issue. In the past I have tried to remove the use of root account, but there were issues when deal with remote servers with limited permission for example when installing package onto the remote server, when deploy things, we often need to add missing components. But with the direction of moving to k8s as a deployment platform, that problem is no longer an issue, I think we can start removing the root use. A patch set will be a lot help to address this." created="2019-02-14 11:49:10.0" updateauthor="tongliofcary" updated="2019-02-14 11:49:10.0"/>

CDATA since ansible agent has been designed to also deal with cloud like provisioning new VMs, stand up k8s, deal with overlay networks, we really need to still use root user for accomplishing these tasks. At present, we can not really remove its use yet.   ></body> </Action>

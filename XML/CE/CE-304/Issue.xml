CDATA Currently the Docker image sizes for Cello components are very large.  There are several disadvantages to this: # Development and testing is slow as it will take a long time to build the images # It will consume a lot of bandwidth when pulling the images form Docker Hub # It will take a lot of hard disk space  Â   Suggestions: # Use Alpine instead of Ubuntu as the base image # Optimize the Dockerfile scripts  ></description> </Issue>

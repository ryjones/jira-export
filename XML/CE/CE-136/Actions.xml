CDATA Hey Baohua, I am really interesting in this feature, after deep-dive of Blockchian-Explorer I have some ideas about sub-tasks 1 (below N=1,2,3... ):  1.  While deploying a fabric cluster, like fabric-cluster-N, a container that running Blockchian-Explorer will be created as well, let's call it explorer-container-N.  2. The newly generated exporer-container-N will be configured, and it will and only will connect to a fabric-cluster-N.  3. Repeat step 1 && step 2 while deploying a new fabric cluster.     my understanding of this feature are listed as above, and here come some questions: # Which component will create the exporer-container ? cello-host or cello-worke? # Due to every fabric cluster correspond to a exporer-container, how could we assign the port? # Any way to combine all fabric cluster into one exporer-container ?  ></body> </Action>

Here are my thoughts, take the docker host as a worker node for example:  Cello will create fabric network in the worker nodes using docker-compose file, so we need to add the blockchain-explorer as a service inside the docker-compose file, and let it connect to the booted fabric network.  Here you can find some sample code (not finished yet), FYI.   https://github.com/yeasy/docker-compose-files/blob/master/hyperledger_fabric/1.0.4/docker-compose-2orgs-4peers-solo.yaml   Pls feel free to let me know if you wanna pick up the task.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~baohua  Hi Baohua, I have some modification need to let you know. 1. Currently cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/fabric-solo-4.yaml has defined a ca container, however, neither org1 nor org2 is relative to this ca, so I remove  ca.example.com|http://ca.example.com/ , and add  ca.org1.example.com|http://ca.org1.example.com/  and  ca.org2.example.com.|http://ca.org2.example.com/   2. I found some useless private-key files under cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/ org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore|http://org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore   and cello/src/agent/docker/_compose_files/fabric-1.0/local/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/ org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp/keystore|http://org2.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore  I removed them and left the one that correspond to public key.  3. It seems we don’t mount any chiancode into cli container, so I created a ‘chiancodes’ folder with some chaincode examples in it, and mount this folder into cli container.  4. Since we have mount TLS certificates into Fabric cluster, so I enable TLS by default.  I also found a bug during working on CE-136. For every “fabric-1.0” cluster, we assign a set of worker ports for them, however, we are not actually mapping the container port to worker port, furthermore, we don’t expose the hole cluster to external, only one peer and one ca was exposed. As far as I concerned, we should refine the mapping solution, make every component of “fabric-1.0” cluster can be accessed from external.  ></body> </Action>

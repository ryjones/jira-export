CDATA -Out of the box with AWS, the ansible agent defaults to using the latest Ubuntu 16.04 AMI.-  -This AMI no longer ships with python2, by default it ships with python3.-  -However, the ansible playbook assumes (but does not ensure) a python2 environment (it installs pip2 and not pip3 on nodes, etc) and will fail.-   --   -Since it's relatively simple to modify the node creation scripts to work under a python3 environment, and that seems cleaner than explicitly installing a python2 environment on each node, going to go ahead and submit a PR that does that.-     The above was the result of poor understanding on my part, so I am updating this to include the small tweaks I made while figuring out that I was wrong :D  ></description> </Issue>

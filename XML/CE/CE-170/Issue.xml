CDATA I went through the exercise of setting up cello on POWER Arch and I almost made it working on power, that's when I realized wouldn't it be easier if we have customized baseimage ( just like HL-fabric-baseimage ).  Also this would eliminate the need of re-structuring docker-compose-files just to make it working on non-x86 arch's, if we tag the resultant docker-image as *cello-baseimage:$ARCH* & *cello-baseimage:latest* .  ></description> </Issue>

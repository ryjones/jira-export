Two main issues to call out: # https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-164 - Remove Highchart. This is a high-priority bug given the non-commercial clause. # /cello/user-dashboard/package.json - this appears to have been incorrectly tagged with the ISC license possibly due to NPM generating this file.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When I used the latest Cello code, released on 24/11/18, and run make start, I get an error that the Environment variable SERVICE_PUBLIC_IP is not set; exit 1;  so I can't run the operator dashboard  I've looked at the Makefile, and the variable actually seems to be called SERVER_PUBLIC_IP. Please note that I'm running this on RHEL  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Dear Baohua,   I was investigating this further and it doesn't seem like there is an easy way to integrate gerrit with rocketchat.   I know we have tried integrating github before, but github wont be able to tell us whenever a new patchset is created.   Have you tried enabling the watched projects in gerrit?  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/settings/projects   This will notify you in case there is a new change uploaded in the cello repo.      Also, this way, gerrit wont spam the channel.      Please let me know if this option would work for you      Thanks a ton!  Jess.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Aha, it's pity we cannot have this functionality.  I remember gerrit works well with IRC even.  Thanks for ur help, Jessica, and pls let us know if there's any progress in future.  Would close this issue first.  ></body> </Action>

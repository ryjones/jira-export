CDATA Deploying fabric network on k8s on AWS vendor, There is no flexibility to choose domain name.      In cello/src/agent/ansible/vars/aws.yml, the file gives opportunity to set fabric domain name like below. {code:java} // code placeholder # fabric network node names expect to be using a clear pattern, this defines  # the prefix for the node names.   name_prefix: "fabric",   domain: "fabricnet" {code} But when change domain value to different one, k8s setup not working properly. The reason is the k8s domain name is fixed in cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/env_k8s/post/template/dnscontroller.j2 as "fabricnet."  ></description> </Issue>

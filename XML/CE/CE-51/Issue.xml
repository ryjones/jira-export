CDATA After discussion with  ~baohua , seems we could integrate fabric-operator to Cello through expose specific API.Â   The original  doc|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4W_hltmIybOkG4JGMX_cpEFcWqoi7aJHIFNHhzed8E/edit  is here.   Since fabric-operator is using Golang and it is a independent module. It is better we use a dedicated repo to construct CI build.   ~ChristopherFerris   ~lehors   ~baohua   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thanks for adding the section about Cello. We've now moved things to GitHub with TeX and the Cello section is here -  https://github.com/cmickeyb/hyperledgerwp/blob/master/CurrentProjects/cello.tex   I was wondering though if it would be possible to expand it a bit more to match up with others like Composer ( https://github.com/cmickeyb/hyperledgerwp/blob/master/CurrentProjects/composer.tex ) as it's a bit shorter compared with the rest at the moment?  Thanks for your time.   -Travin Keith  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~baohua  couple of questions & thoughts :-  I presume we will provide a configurable variable (called channel) via cello-dashboard and later fetched onto the bootstrapped blockchain network to create a channel ?  I think it would be good to have a capability to add a new fabric-ca instance as well from cello-dashboard, I know we can always increase the  cacount|https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#cacount   however cacount would be leveraged during initial bootstrapping. Would be good to have a capability to spin up an extra fabric-ca-server.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="52509" issue="26796" author="shuowang" type="comment" body=" ~baohua  OK. Each network has their own fabric-ca servers and the workflow is same.  Among different networks, the number of orgs and peers and consensus type may vary. All these differences will be presented directly in docker-compose.yml. I think for step 2, we should generate   docker-compose.yml dynamically.  ~hightall  has done it in  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26925/  and I think I could add fabric-ca part based on it." created="2018-10-22 01:38:08.0" updateauthor="shuowang" updated="2018-10-22 01:38:08.0"/>

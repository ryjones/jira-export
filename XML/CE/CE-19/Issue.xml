CDATA From Daniel Vielvoye <dvielvoye@gmail.com>  Hello,   I'm trying Cello and would like to prepare a presentation to our management with the idea to promote the idea of "blockchain platform as a Service" in our community cloud environment. After installing cello (1 master and 2 workers) , I'm now facing the need to have some demo to confirm the setup works and demonstrate how this works .   it would be nice to have a ready to deploy blockchain to deploy on Cello . This would allow to present a running experience of Cello and will also define the guideline to effectively deploy blockchains over Cello .(ideally such "demo-chain" would be available with the different blockchain engines supported by Cello. By the way a good instructions set will also be required on how to deploy code on the chain created in Cello  as a next step , I would like to be able to POC with a context meaningful  (so our business people can "see" what it can be used for) . Here I would like to have a t utorial : a step by step guide to have a newbie able to develop a basic application using a blockchain on Cello . This could be a Go or Java step by step development and deployment guide (a cookbook style) to write and demo a predefined ,limited scope, "project".  Are such demo/tutorial available for Cello ?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA ansible agent uses two images tags to setup fabric network. one tag for fabric images such as peer, orderer, ccenv, tools and ca one tag for kafka, zookeeper, couchdb etc.  The issue is that in test env, when cello sets up fabric network, testers may want to use snapshot images for fabric peer, orderer, ccenv, tools, these snapshot images won't be available from ca since ca images get built in its own repo and there won't be match ca snapshot images. We need to introduce a ca tag.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This feature adds two components "Cello-Identity" and "Cello-ConsortiumMember" to the cello. # Cello-identity Create and manage identity (certificate and private key) in Cello independently into a separate component. Define some common interfaces in this component and implement them with fabric ca. In the database, we store the certificate and private key when the user needs to deploy a new node or use a new client User, the service can provide all the required certificates and private keys. This component can provide a CRL for updating the channel configuration when the certificate needs to invalidate the original certificate due to a private key leak or the like. Users can also rewrite their implementation to suit their business based on specific needs. # Cello-ConsortiumMember This component manages members of a federation or channel by submitting a channel configuration. The specific implementation uses the research results of the Fabric Interop Working Group, and proposes another alternative in the attachment ^Cello-ConsortiumMember alternative.pdf .  ></description> </Issue>

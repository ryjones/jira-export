CDATA Rather than just fix the syntax errors I used a 'pattern' file to replaced the long, error prone list of greps. This will make it less error prone to manage that list of files that are not not scanned for license.  Since this required that the entire script needed to be validated I also added '-ue' options to bash arguments. Also changed Makefile to 'exec' the script rather than source it. Note that the '-e' would have caught the syntax error that required this Ticket.  Review: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/31338        ></body> </Action>

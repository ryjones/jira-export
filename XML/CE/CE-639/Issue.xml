CDATA I am trying to setup a  docker worker node in cello. The worker node is in different machine with master node.   So I follow the document  https://hyperledger-cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/setup_worker_docker/   I installed docker, change the port to 2375, then I ran the command   `MASTER_NODE=x.x.x.x WORKER_TYPE=docker make setup-worker`  but it always told me the `MASTER_NODE` is a empty string.  I found in the setup script `cello/scripts/worker_node/setup_worker_node_docker.sh` . Cello  always set `MASTER_NODE=""` which I believe is the reason.   ></description> </Issue>

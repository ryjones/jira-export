<Action id="40902" issue="23971" author="tongliofcary" type="comment" body="sam, the issue is that from cloud to cloud, the wait time will be very different. The cloud-init can take a long time. I think that the best way will be adding a parameter as a wait time in the cloud configuraiton file so that you can adjust that value according to your need. It will be nice to have a patch set on this." created="2018-02-27 04:20:46.0" updateauthor="tongliofcary" updated="2018-02-27 04:20:46.0"/>

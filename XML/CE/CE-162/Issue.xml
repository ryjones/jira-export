CDATA Currently, the scripts/master_node/setup.sh does not recognize Mac OS, Mac OS will be classified as "Unknown Distribution", and go through normal flow. That will include several pitfall of setup-master goal. #  the docker and pip installation will be skipped. # MacOS(Sierra 10.12.6) doesn't have a "usermod" command, so "sudo usermod -aG docker $\{USER}" will always fail and  {color:#ff0000}the process continues and didn't indicate failure in the middle.{color} # The MacOS(Sierra 10.12.6) does not  create a group for a user by default.  The "&& sudo chown -R $\{USER}:$\{USER} $\{DB_DIR}" is assuming there is a same name group for current user, it will fail if current user don't manually create a same name group. {color:#ff0000}The process continues and didn't indicate failure in the middle.{color} User then will see Mongo mount failure while the cello service is up, and don't know why.  And the 4th problem of Cello about mac is that document has several places mentioning user should configure the firewall by "{{sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1}}". Actually, MacOS don't have this  either, the equal thing should be "sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1". This issue will also cause false alert in "setup-worker" process.  ></description> </Issue>

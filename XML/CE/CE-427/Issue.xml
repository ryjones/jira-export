CDATA Am new user, am performing Tutorial. I created a Fabric 1.1 chain in Operator Dashboard. I switch to User Dashboard to "Apply" a chain, but the drop down combo presents only a Fabric 1.0 selection. I had not created any Fabric 1.0 networks. I did not check whether a Fabric 1.2 network might be presented if I had created one.  Impact: Blocks cello adoption by new users.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

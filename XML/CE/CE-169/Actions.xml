Do you want simply move the document into a different location or re-work on other documents (where and which?) to reference the agent docs? I am not really sure what your intension is on this one, that is reason why I could not just move it in previous patch. If you can comment a bit on this issue, that will be really helpful.

CDATA Sure, i mean we need to put all documentations into the docs path, which is more easy for users to find guidelines.  And there are also several docs for work nodes like  http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#worker-node.   Feel free to add more (e.g., ansible one).  How do u think?  ></body> </Action>

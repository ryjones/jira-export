CDATA Can you try staging the binaries in mentioned path and retry the operation as such ?  And I presume you have done this already  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md#setup-fabric-network  ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Krishna, # not sure how to "stage the binaries" I know where they should be (because they aren't there) but I'm not sure where to get them from. # I'm using the "convenience" playbook described on the same page but further down:  https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/docs/worker_ansible_howto.md#convenient-configurations-and-commands   I saw this playbook executed successfully in a youtube video (by hightall) and did exactly what he did in the video.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA so this is the file that's missing "/opt/gopath/bc1st/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/build/bin/cryptogen" but how is it supposed to get there?   I tried to decipher the ansible scripts at that point but I can't understand what's going on there.  /home/ubuntu/cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricbuild/tasks/apply.yml  ></body> </Action>

CDATA By "Staging" I mean downloading binaries from nexus repository. You can download and stage the binaries by following the steps mentioned here :-   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/samples.html?highlight=binaries#download-platform-specific-binaries    To summarize you would be doing this :-   curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | bash -s *1.1.**0*  ,   Ensure you pass Hyperledger Fabric's tags as such.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA OK, thanks for the hint, that worked. So here is what I did: # started with a clean slate # instead of using the aws.yml playbook, I used the individual ones: # ansible-playbook -e "mode=apply env=aws cloud_type=aws" provcluster.yml # ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=aws env_type=flanneld" initcluster.yml # ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=compose" setupfabric.yml # --> this stopped with the error cryptogen not found # ssh into the machine and curl -sSL  https://goo.gl/6wtTN5  | bash -s *1.1.**0*  # **copying the binaries from fabric-sample/bin to /opt/gopath/bc1st/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/build/ # replay the fabric setup: ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e "mode=apply env=bc1st deploy_type=compose" setupfabric.yml  This worked!  So that means that the step in the setupfabric playbook that downloads the cryptogen binary is not working! Looking throught the ansible files, I believe that the problem is in this file:  */cello/src/agent/ansible/roles/deploy_compose/fabricbuild/tasks/build.yml*  Unfortunately I'm not an ansible expert so I can't debug this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Cello source was scanned using Fossology to determine license for files contained in the following repositories *  http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello  *  http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello-analytics   From the Hyperledger Charter ( https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter)  Section 13, all files that are included in Hyperledger projects should either be licensed with the Apache License, Version 2.0 for source code or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for documentation.  There are a number of files in the Cello source base that do not meet these requirements.  See the attached file for results.   The highest priority should be the three files that come from a proprietary component called Highcharts.  These are not open source files and *must* be replaced.  The files listed under Attribution, Other/Unknown, and No License Found need to be resolved. For the Attribution and Other/Unknown, these appear to be tied to the themes and user dashboard. These should be replaced with code meeting the Apache 2.0 license.  For the files listed as No License Found, we should first check with the original contributors to make sure that they can contain an Apache 2.0 license (for source code) or a Creative Commons with Attribution 4.0 license (for documentation). Once this has been verified, the editable files must be annotated with the correct license text and/or the SPDX short identifiers (see   https://spdx.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/files/using_spdx_license_list_short_identifiers.pdf ). For binary files, a license.txt file should be included in the directory calling out the file types and the associated license.  Any files that are not covered by Apache 2.0 or CC by 4.0 that need to remain with the project will need to go through an exception process with the governing board.   ></description> </Issue>

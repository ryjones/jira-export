CDATA At the end of Q3 2018 Fabric removed it dependency on the fabric-baseimage as the project had gotten out of scope and become a behemoth container used to support many things it was never intended to do.  The Fabric team will no longer be maintaining the Fabric Base Image repo and as such we are asking repos who use it to convert to using their own Ubuntu builds. At this point we are no longer updating the repo from within the Fabric team. Cello needs to gather its requirements and replace the image with its own internalized image.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The AWS Security Group created by Cello Ansible is defined in /src/agent/ansible/roles/cloud_aws/prepare/tasks/apply.yml  1. If the rules for the ec2_group loaded in Ansible variables, "default variables", rather than hardcoded values, then it would be easier for customers to leverage these Ansible scripts, by overriding the the Security Group rules as necessary for their environment. The existing settings which allows 0.0.0.0, all traffic, is very open and should be customizable.    2. The ansible ec2_group resource has the feature: "Rules list may include its own name in `group_name`. This allows idempotent loopback additions (e.g. allow group to access itself)." Perhaps _some_ of the rules could have such a setting. I.e., only allow the Fabric group to have access, rather than the world (0.0.0.0).    ></description> </Issue>

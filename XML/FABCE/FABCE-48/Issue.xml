CDATA In the fab3_test.go integration tests, there's a common pattern for making rpc calls:  		resp, err = sendRPCRequest(client, "eth_getLogs", proxyAddress, 23, logFilter) 		Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred()) 		rBody, err = ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body) 		Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred())  We should put the lower three lines into the sendRPCRequest as they seem to be present on all occasions of sendRPCRequest.  ></description> </Issue>

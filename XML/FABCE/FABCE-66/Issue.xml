CDATA The private method getTransactionInformation is used in GetTransactionReceipt, GetTransaction, and GetBlockByNumber.  The method however assumes that the payload that is a chaincode transaction ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/protos/common/common.pb.go#L73), Â but other types of transactions can be possible causing the methods to fail.  The above methods should not fail when parsing through a block that has transactions that are not of the chaincode transaction type and should not fail if the chaincode transaction is for a chaincode that is not the evmcc.  As part of this, improve the testing on these instructions. One good test case is the genesis block.  ></description> </Issue>

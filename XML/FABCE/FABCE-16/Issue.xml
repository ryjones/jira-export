CDATA As part of the update to Burrow  release 0.24.4, evmcc has the ability of providing a blockhash function. # Implement the function to invoke the `qscc` and query based on the given blocknumber on the same channel the instance of the evmcc is running on. {{stub.InvokeChaincode("qscc",     byte\{  byte("GetBlockByNumber"),   byte(stub.GetChannelID()),   byte(string(height))})}} # Remove the disclaimer/limitation in the README concerning the blockhash opcode  # Add both unit level and integration test in the e2e suite about the blockhash opcode.     Open Questions: # How to handle blocks that do no exist yet? Currently the function does not allow for errors to be returned. # Verify that no special permissions are necessary for the evmcc to be able to query the qscc.  ></description> </Issue>

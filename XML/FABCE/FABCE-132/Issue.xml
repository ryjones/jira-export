CDATA -Add the method eth_getTransactionCount as defined here:-  -https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactioncount.-|https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactioncount   Stub out eth_getTransactionCount to always return 0. Truffle uses this instruction to pass along the nonce in the ethererum networks, but since Fabric does not need this value and doesn't keep track of an equivalent, this instruction should be stubbed out.  We should also note this as a limitation of fab3.  Â   `truffle deploy` requires eth_getTransactionCount  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I see two options for this: 1. Start storing a counter per account everytime they initiate a transaction (evmcc side) and then we only have to query that key from fab3. Problem with this approach would be that there could be higher chance of collisions causing less transactions to actually succeed.  2. Fab3 goes through all the transactions/blocks associated with the evmcc and count transactions in which the specified address is the to.  This is time consuming and would mean going through the entire ledger everytime this method is called.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA After speaking with Truffle engineers, we have decided that getTransactionCount is not necessary to implement but we do need to stub it out for truffle commands to continue.     getTransactionCount is meant to track the nonce of an individual in the Ethereum network and since Fabric does not have the same concept, we are not going to implement this instruction.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA An EVM chaincode is essentially a system chaincode written in Go, that wraps Burrow EVM implementation. It accomplishes following:  install: - feed _deploy bytecode_ into Burrow evm - store produced _runtime bytecode_ into {{evmscc}} ledger, with generated address being the key  invoke: - look up the _runtime bytecode_ with contract address - args and bytecode are input of Burrow evm - return the output of evm execution  {{INIT}} in {{evmscc}} is a no-op, as this doesn't fit into Ethereum model very well.  This would require Golang 1.10 to support {{plugin}} on Linux/OSX  ></description> </Issue>

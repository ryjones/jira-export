CDATA from the meeting 2018-01-03 with truffle developers, there appears to be some other escape hatches.     one involves using a 'provider' that will transform calls we don't support into other calls we do support. This would be combined with some work that implements getStorageAt which appears to be a very generic way to get information out of the ledger and have details handled on the client side.     My understanding is that ganache is a pluggable/configurable provider, but this needs to be checked.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm a bit late to the party, but I notice you're discussing stateful requests (e.g. \{{eth_newFilter}} and friends). I'm pleased to say that the Ethereum community seems to be quickly moving away from these stateful methods. Last I checked, Infura doesn't support them, and section 6.3 the  current EEA specification|https://entethalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/EEA_Enterprise_Ethereum_Client_Specification_V2.pdf  drops the requirement for Enterprise Ethereum clients to support any stateful RPC methods.  I generally advise people writing Ethereum applications today to use a WebSockets transport rather than HTTP, and to make use of the newer  RPC PUB/SUB API|https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/RPC-PUB-SUB . This not only allows for a more efficient push-based subscription mechanism for logs, blocks, and transactions, but it also makes it so that the lifecycle of those subscriptions is tied directly to the lifecycle of the application client's connection. That is, when the connection closes the node no longer needs to service the outstanding subscriptions for that connection.   Ganache|https://truffleframework.com/ganache  and  ganache-cli|https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli  have implemented these features for a while now, and I'd recommend them as a platform for experimentation to see how it works.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~benjamincburns !     That's great to know that the spec has dropped that requirement. I have not kept up with those changes.  We do want to at least provide a RPC option instead of using HTTP. That work fell lower in our priorities, but we should start looking into it again.  ></body> </Action>

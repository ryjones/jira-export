CDATA Split the vendor directory between evmcc and fab3 so that evmcc does not need to pull in fab3 dependencies when uploaded as a chaincode. Also have evmcc consolidated into one directory will make chaincode packaging easier.  Since we will be recreating the dependency graphs in this process, also switch to using go modules. EVMCC will still require a vendor directory until go modules are supported in the chaincode container.  ></description> </Issue>

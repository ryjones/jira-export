CDATA We should talk to Truffle team to see why they expect net_version to be a number.   Spec does not specify this restriction, if Truffle is unable to make a change or suggestion, we should make our net_version a number.     This seems to only affect Truffle v5 onwards  Update: Truffle uses net_version as a way to manage the different networks the IDE is configured to.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a smart contract calls a function from another smart contract, the EVM errors out with the error: "Contract does not have permission to call".     Error seems to be coming from smart contract permissions not being set properly at deployment: We need to add to the evmcc the proper permissions when creating a new smart contract: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/837dd44ee30153187182e1afd5fb36eaf4505196/execution/execution_test.go#L133  Code should be added in this area:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/blob/master/evmcc/evmcc.go#L114    As part of this what permissions do we want to enable.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fab3 binary does not wait for the underlying http server to be created before waiting on termination or error signal. This is due to how the start function is and the goroutine in main that run's the http server.Â   Lets separate the creation of the server from running the server.  Also Shutdown() should check to make sure the httpServer is not nil before trying to close it.  ></description> </Issue>

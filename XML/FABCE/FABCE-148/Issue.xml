CDATA The v1.4 tag of Fabric still points to nexus to build components causing a failure since Fabric has moved off of Nexus.   Integration tests need to be updated to use a fabric branch that is not connected to Nexus. Update the tests to use Fabric `release-1.4` branch or if a 1.4.5 release is cut.   ></description> </Issue>

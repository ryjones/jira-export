CDATA To demonstrate the capabilities of evm chaincode, and the whole concept of running a DApp built for Ethereum (public chain) in Fabric (consortium chain), we need to come up with a DApp example that actually works with Ethereum network, and show how to migrate it to Fabric.  The outcome of this task could be a whitepaper/document/tutorial, and sample code.  ></description> </Issue>

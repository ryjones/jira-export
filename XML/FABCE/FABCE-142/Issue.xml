CDATA Truffle uses a network/chain ID ( https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#net_version) Â as an identifier to differentiate between networks. Though the spec does not specify that the ID needs to be a number, Truffle has added that requirement.  Create an identifier that will be unique to the the EVMCC and the channel it is running on. This value should be queryable from the EVMCC. In a later task we will return query and return that value through fab3.  ></description> </Issue>

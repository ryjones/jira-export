CDATA Bump burrow/evm pkg version     Burrow Version 0.23.3:  1. EVM vm now needs an Interface object which can be created by wrapping the existing statemanager in the Burrow State( https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/v0.23.3/execution/evm/state.go#L61-L67 ) and Cache( https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/v0.23.3/execution/evm/state.go#L69-L71 ) objects.  NewState, linked above, takes in a state.ReaderWriter object which is the type of our Statemanager.     2. StateManager needs to change object types from account.Address to crytpo.Address     3.  evmcc needs to change object types from account.Address to crypto.Address     4. EventSink is a new event interface necessary for vm.Call:  https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/v0.23.3/execution/evm/event_sink.go#L8-L11  We need to switch eventmanager to implement the EventSink interface.     5. fab3 needs to switch to using exec.LogEvent as the type instead of events.EventDataLog Note: We may want to create an intermediary event type so that fab3 does not need to be updated every time burrow changes its interface   ></description> </Issue>

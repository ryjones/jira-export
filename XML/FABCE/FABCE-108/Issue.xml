CDATA The explanations of the fabric-chaincode-evm are focused towards an audience that is already familiar with Fabric and Ethereum. The documentation needs to be improved so users can understand the end to end and how all the components come together. As part of this, include a diagram that shows the overall picture and components that occur. The goal is to show the following workflow and see that the web3 client and the ethereum contract can be migrated from Ethereum. web3 client -> fab3 proxy -> fabric peer -> evm chaincode -> burrow evm -> ethereum contract  This links to the powerpoint used for the fabric-chaincode-evm playback that has architecture diagrams that can be used:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ksk98p8h0GKhxgRtTYALMiZll4lz1Hx/view?usp=sharing      ></description> </Issue>

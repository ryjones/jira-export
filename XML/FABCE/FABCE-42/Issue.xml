CDATA Smart contracts have the ability in the EVM to generate other smart contracts.Â   Enable this feature on the evmcc by adding permissions to the contract accounts:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/blob/6404c8dc4455f63200e190b02b21f8e5f402c966/evmcc/evmcc.go#L33   https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/v0.24.6/permission/perm_flag.go#L58   CreateContract and possibly CreateAccount permissions need to be added.  Update: CreateContract permission is good enough Previously we wanted to start with the approach of being more restrictive and only expand permissions when feedback was provided: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-evm?msg=xgyXPorfhJvofpKc8  ></description> </Issue>

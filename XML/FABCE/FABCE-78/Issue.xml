CDATA When evmcc is queried for an account that does not exist it currently fails when trying to decode empty bytes.  We should instead check that the bytes are not empty before decoding. We should only return an error if non nil bytes cannot be decoded.  This error causes `truffle deploy` to fail currently.  ></description> </Issue>

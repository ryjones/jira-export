CDATA There is bug in the STATICCALL opcode in the Burrow EVM v0.23.3.  We should cherry-pick this commit into our vendored version of Burrow so that we have the fix and we do not need to wait for a release of Burrow with the fix to come out.   https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/commit/b4ca985925f71406230de48a5b8e9c3a233fc751   *Update:*Â Burrow has made a new release that contains the static call fix as well as other changes to the EVM. However Burrow has had to patch its tendermint dependency in vendor because of a licensing issue. Upgrade the burrow dependency instead of patching our current vendored Burrow code.  ></description> </Issue>

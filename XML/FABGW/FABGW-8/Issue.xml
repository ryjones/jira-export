CDATA Enhance the TransactionSubmit function to optionally wait until the transaction has been committed to the ledger.  Requires Gateway to receive events from org peers for a standalone implementation, or monitor ledger updates for the local peer for an embedded implementation.  Commit failures need to be communicated back to the client with appropriate information to help diagnose the reason and cause of the failure. This should be at least the transaction status (validation code) and probably the whole transaction envelope too.  TODO: * -Go client basic implementation- * Node client basic implementation * Java client basic implementation * Retry obtaining commit status on connection error – _could be deferred to async commit wait story_  ></description> </Issue>

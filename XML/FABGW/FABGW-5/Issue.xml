CDATA Implement basic EvaluateTransaction function in the gateway server and all three client SDKs.  Note the following restrictions for this story (will be implemented in future stories): * No discovery results will be used to determine peer(s) to target. Any available peer will be used. * Block height will not be used to determine which peer is most likely to give the correct result (assuming a previous SubmitTransaction has updated the ledger)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *As an* application developer *I want* to receive chaincode events *So that* I can trigger business processes in response to committed transactions  Proposed API design is to add an {{AddChaincodeListener}} (and corresponding {{RemoveChaincodeListener}})method to the {{Network}}. This will have similar behaviour to the {{addContractListener}} methods exposed on the {{Contract}} in the existing Fabric programming model. The reason for providing this method on the Network rather than the Contract is that the events received are specific to a chaincode, and may be emitted by any of the contracts deployed within that chaincode.  Proposed implementation is the add a {{ChaincodeEvents}} gRPC service endpoint to Fabric Gateway. The request message may include the Envelope currently used as the request message for the {{Deliver}} service to enable a standalone Fabric Gateway implementation to extract chaincode events from block events using the {{Deliver}} service to handle authentication and authorization of the client identity. However, the embedded Fabric Gateway implementation will obtain chaincode events for committed transactions directly from the ledger.  The response will be a stream of messages including a block number and {{ChaincodeEvent}} protobuf message.  This story explicitly deals only with realtime event listening, so starting with the current block at the point where the listener is connected.  ></description> </Issue>

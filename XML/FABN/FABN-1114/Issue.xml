CDATA The 1.4 programming model has been presented and discussed with users (architects and developers) and also at a breakout session during the Hyperledger Hackfest in Montreal.  One aspect that caused some confusion was the naming of the 'executeTransaction' function.  The difference between this and the 'submitTransaction' function is that 'executeTransaction' only invokes the transaction function (chaincode) and returns its result to the client, but does not commit the RWset to the ledger.  It was decided that 'evaluateTransaction' is a better name for this function.  This task changes the name of the function in the Contract class of the fabric-network API, updates all the unit tests, integration tests, docs and samples.  ></description> </Issue>

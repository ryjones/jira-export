CDATA The fabric-client API uses the ChannelEventHub API to listen for new and replay missed chaincode/transaction/block events.   We need to create a new fabric-network API that supports the following:  * Simple subscription to chaincode/transaction/block events * Simple to catch up (replay) missed events  Replay requires the API to persist the last block number and transactionID seen, and then give that to fabric-network API when it connects.   The persistence method should be pluggable to allow applications to use whatever storage strategy they want.  Keeping track of the current block height and the last transaction ID can be done by overriding successful callback methods (and persisting per listener)     A sample should be created that demonstrates how the API is used and why its features are useful client applications.    ></description> </Issue>

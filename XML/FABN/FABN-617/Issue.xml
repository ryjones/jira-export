CDATA A lot of developers complain about encounter unexpected 'channel not found' problem when using uppercase character in channel name.  as  ~jyellick  recommended,  ??Maybe the SDK could check for illegal characters in the channel ID and return an error to the user indicating that the channel ID is illegal???  Â   we could insert 'pattern match' verification on channel id input: {code:java} channelAllowedChars = " a-z  a-z0-9.- *" {code}  ></description> </Issue>

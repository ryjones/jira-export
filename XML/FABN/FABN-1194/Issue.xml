CDATA When building discover peers the Channel.js provides new fresh connection options skipping any client or default connection options.  Thus there is no way to configure connection options (such as keep-alive, timeouts, etc) for discovery peers.   Then if the connection is broken (e.g. for Azure's it's necessary to have keep-alive pings as the load balancer has 4 min connection timeout) discovering stops working.     ></description> </Issue>

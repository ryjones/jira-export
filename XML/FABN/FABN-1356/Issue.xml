CDATA Technically network instances own the resources to connect to a channel, not the gateway. The gateway is the identity owner and can have mulitple networks associated with it. To cleanup a network you have to dispose of the gateway but if you only want to dispose the resources for a single network rather than all the networks a gateway is managing this is currently not possible. Is there much overhead to having a 1-1 relationship between gateway and network so if you need to interact with a network have a unique gateway instance rather than reusing the same gateway ?  If there is an overhead worth handling then it should be possible to dispose of a single network from a gateway otherwise you have to dispose of the whole gateway and all it's networks just to cleanup one network.  This could be just a doc about best practice for multiple network connections or an improvement to the gateway implementation  Don't know if the same applies to the equivalent Java Implementation or not.    ></description> </Issue>

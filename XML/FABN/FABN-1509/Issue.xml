CDATA In beta 3, Channel.queryTransactoin() and Channel.queryBlock(..) functions are not available. we have to do system chaincode query to get the details. just wondering if they will be added back in v2.0.0.      I would like to get details of transaction based just transactinId (no blockNumber). It would great to get the following information about the transaction   1) if tx is committed or not? if not commited , reason ?   2) tx is Valid or not?  3) which block it is included in?  4) tx proposal (input)  5) endorsements  6) tx Response  7) events  ===   ></description> </Issue>

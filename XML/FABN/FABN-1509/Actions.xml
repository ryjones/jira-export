CDATA Hi  ~fabDev20  there aren't any plans to add these apis back into v2.0.0.  You can get a lot of the information you've listed here by making use of the apis in fabric-network, by adding a blockListener to a network and accessing the properties on a blockEvent. From the blockEvent, you can get it's transaction events, containing useful properties as listed here:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/module-fabric-network.TransactionEvent.html   Adding a blockListener info here: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/module-fabric-network.Network.html#addBlockListener__anchor  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~heatherp   We can get details about the transaction if we have the block number.  However, I am trying to find solution to get transaction details  if I just have transaction id (no block number), similar to transactionReceipt of ethereum.  This could be because of offline transaction or checking history of transactions etc...    How can I can get achieve this in fabric?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA can this issue be reopened?   adding use cases where transactionId based query will be useful   Scenario 1) To get the details of which all transactions (with details) changed key history, I can get the txid from from chaincode key history but no block number.  Scenario 2) - in few cases, a client may submit transaction without waiting for commit confirmation or does not get the confirmation because of network or system issues. he just has the transaction id that was submitted we need some way of checking the historical transactions.  it would be great to have api in fabric-sdk-node. ca   ></body> </Action>

CDATA queryBlock() functionality is available through using block listening, so I'm just going to change the title of this issue.  We discussed it amongst the maintainers today and we're currently undecided on how we would go about implementing this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA system chaincode in anyway is also a chaincode you could use `Proposal.js` to do any chaincode related task along with `Commit.js` if need sending to orderer.   Here is my way to do it  https://github.com/davidkhala/fabric-common/blob/master/nodejs/admin/QSCCProposal.js   ~heatherp  This could be labeled as 'Admin Capability'  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~fabDev20  I think you should be able to query the transaction by ID by using just the high level (fabric-network) API to evaluate the  *GetTransactionByID* transaction function on the system chaincode named *qscc.* You would need to pass channel name as the first argument, and transaction ID as the second argument to the transaction function. So something like: {code:java} network.getContract('qscc').evaluateTransaction('GetTransactionByID', channelName, transactionId);{code} What you get back will be a serialized block protobuf, but you can use the protobuf definitions to decode this. Let me know if this works OK for you as I think this (perhaps with some help on the decoding) might be a more workable approach than adding special case functions for everything that can be accessed through system chaincode.  ></body> </Action>

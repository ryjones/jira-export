CDATA Hi, as we found that this problems may result from the unexpected content of memory of buffer.  When I print the content of the credential(ca root), there are so many random content following the ca root content, and sometimes part of the ca root. And when this part appears, ssl problem will arise. After I add the string terminator to the end of the credential string,  all the problems just disappears as I tested. So I think this the root cause. I also got a small patch to fix it. I am not so familiar  with grpc, so this patch may not so elegant. Well I think more investigation will be needed against this problem for a more elegant solution.Â   ></body> </Action>

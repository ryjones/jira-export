CDATA A composer user reported the following {noformat} Another problem after previous one, anyone hitting this randomly, when the Fabric network is having more peers (now I have 4). The frequency of hitting this grpc subchannel creation failure increases when the no. of peers increases (1 peer = no problem, 2 peers = no problems,  3 peers = quite often, 4 peers = only able to dodge this error by luck).  After some google-ing, it looks like concurrency issue when a lot of gRPCs connections are made at the same time. {noformat} The command they tried was {code} $ composer network update --archiveFile build/abc-network.bna -p hlfv1-swarm -i admin -s adminpw {code} which is a submit transaction request and output shows {noformat} E0921 09:13:29.605557944 42762 ssl_transport_security.c:584  Could not load any root certificate. E0921 09:13:29.605659748 42762 ssl_transport_security.c:1297  Cannot load server root certificates.

There is a possibility that the problem has been introduced by this level (or at least a level newer than 1.2.4) in grpc. see   https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/12642  as the user says this describes almost exactly the issue they are seeing  ></description> </Issue>

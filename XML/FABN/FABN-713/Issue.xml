CDATA This new feature will allow the SDK to connect to a CouchDB-based database storage in order to store the end user crypto materials (private key, certifcates) in one place. That way, the user would be able to register/enroll with the membership services once and then connect and interact with the peer network and chaincode from multiple instances of the app or from different clients.  Another important use case is when the client app is deployed via containers (Docker or CloudFoundry), crash recovery will wipe out changes to the file system. So a prevalent practice is for these apps to save configurations to a database (cloudant, redis, etc.) instead.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~angrbrd  I talked to  ~cdaughtr  this morning, since you are in the middle of a big chunk of work for the REST wrapper, she'll build on top of your changeset and make the following changes in order to finish this one off: - change the "Client.js/newDefaultKeyValueStore()" and "utils.js/getDefaultKeyValueStore()" APIs to async (returning Promise) - modify the tests to use the new promise-based APIs - do the necessary merge with the latest master  If you can think of other changes that are needed, please let her know. thanks.  ></body> </Action>

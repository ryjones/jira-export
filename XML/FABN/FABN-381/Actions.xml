CDATA This is really a new feature and needs to be included in the new Chaincode lifecycle.  ~jyellick   ~denyeart   ~mastersingh24  would it be possible to include something in the new metatdata package that could control the instantiate of the chaincode. What node.js chaincode needs is a way to use a `package.json` customized for organization. In the case of node.js this would allow the organization to control where the packages are being installed from, especially in the case where the peer does not have full access to the internet.  ></body> </Action>

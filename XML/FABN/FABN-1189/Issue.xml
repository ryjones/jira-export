CDATA As per the existing logic is written in gulp file to pull the docker images in the release branches is hardcoded to docker image versions. In result, this is not helping us to test the latest changes of fabric release branches with sdk-node release branch changes.  The build process should provide flexibility to test the sdk-node changes on the latest fabric, fabric-ca changes. The logic in the below test.js file needs to be changed.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.4/build/tasks/test.js#L42-L43  ></description> </Issue>

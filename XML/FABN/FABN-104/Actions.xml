CDATA I added app-developer.zip which should go at fabric/docs/app-developer and contains all (or most) application developer related docs.  The missing pieces are: 1) A docker image for the client SDK 2) Build the fabric/sdk/node/doc info (as done by fabric/sdk/node/makedoc.sh) and include in the readme docs.  Need Ramesh to help here.  ></body> </Action>

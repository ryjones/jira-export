CDATA There is a package that is a mis-spelling of another package, both published to NPM:  Correct version:   https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-common   Incorrect:   https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-commmon   We need to either update the misspelled version (which gets about 7 downloads a week, somehow) or delete it. I'm aware of the issues around name squatting - someone is using this.  ></description> </Issue>

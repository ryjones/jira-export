CDATA setUserContext() is always connecting first Certificate Authority in _setUserFromConfig() function.  This is creating problems when that Certificate Authority is down or having problems in responding.  _setUserFromConfig should try to connect other Certificate Authorities (if present in network cofnig) if it fails to get successful enrollment with first Certificate Authority.   We faced this problem and had to remove the first Certificate Authority from the network config to get setUserContext working.   ></description> </Issue>

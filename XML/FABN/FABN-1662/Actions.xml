CDATA Believe error is being reported from "throw Error(result.message);" which give no indication that error is from chaincode on peer.  The debug line above " logger.debug('%s - throw peer response status: %s message: %s', method, result.status, result.message); "  would have provided more detail, but would have had to have debug switched on.  Improvement suggestion is to augment the message with details output to log before throwing error. 					    ></body> </Action>

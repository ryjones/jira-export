CDATA FABN-1646 was reopened due to the error message     Failed to perform query transaction  getAsset  using arguments  client2_32000_305 ,  with error: Error: unexpected end of JSON input  at SingleQueryHandler.evaluate (/home/<user>/caliper/workspace/node_modules/fabric-network/lib/impl/query/singlequeryhandler.js:41:27)  The reported error is coming from chaincode (in this case Go chaincode), but it was not obvious from the message that the root cause was chaincode.  It would have been easier for a user to diagnose if the error had alluded to the root of the error, such as:  `Chaincode Error: unexpected end of JSON input  at SingleQueryHandler.evaluate`  ></description> </Issue>

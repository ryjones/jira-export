CDATA I think what we have today is correct; only Node v10 and v12 are currently LTS releases. We should add v14 once it switches from a current development release to an active LTS release, and probably only remove v10 once it leaves LTS maintenance in 2021.  Any changes to the supported Node versions needs to have accompanying changes to the Node versions tested by the CI pipeline.  ></body> </Action>

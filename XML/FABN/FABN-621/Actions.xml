CDATA  ~ptippett  Please clarify: Is this request for removing old versions of chaincodes that have been up-versioned (i.e. remove chaincode that is not in use)? Or is this a request for the ability to discard one - ie. effectively uninstantiate and uninstall chaincodes throughout all the peers in a network? Or something else?  Is this related to FAB-3742?  ></body> </Action>

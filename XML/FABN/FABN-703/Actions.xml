CDATA Re-purposed (since it's not possible to reject issues right now in JIRA) from the original work item with the following description:  Currently, the HFC sdk member class has a the deploy/invoke/query method which would try all peers in its connection list to see which one can succeed on the transaction. It moves on to the next peer in the list, if the first peer it tries fails on the connection. It doesn't provide interface/method to appoint one specific peer to send the transaction to. While, testing on specific peer would be needed in some cases. For example, we want to test on sending query on all peers concurrently.

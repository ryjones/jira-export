CDATA As is Node-SDK does not work in Cloud Foundry (CF) runtimes because it cannot install the node package called "hashtable".  That package requires GCC. However CF don't let you run “apt-get install build-essentials” so it fails to “npm install hashtable”.   A solution is to replace hashtable with hashtable-js, described as "a pure Javascript replacement for node-hashtable", I implemented the code and it seem to work. Now I need someone's help to make the official contribution. Here's the next steps:  (1) make the changes shown in the attached photo (2) run the E2E test (3) push the code  ></description> </Issue>

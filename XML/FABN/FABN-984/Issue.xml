CDATA The node SDK should only retry and pick a different peer to request endorsement from if:  * It was not able to connect to the peer * The peer returned a gRPC related error, such as- "the service isn't implemented"  Any other errors - such as Fabric protobuf messages, should be handled by the application.  The application should decide, whether to retry the endorsement, or do something else.    ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   ~denyeart   ~sykesm    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There is a log statement emitted in the node tests:  {noformat} Failed to send transaction and get notifications within the timeout period.` {noformat}  Although this might make sense in the context of a test, it seems that users are picking up this test code as the basis for their apps, and ending up with an unhelpful error message.  Naively reading this error message, the user thinks that the call to {{Broadcast}} is failing, when in fact, it usually the case that the {{Broadcast}} is just fine, but the event is never received from the peer.  It would be great if the test were enhanced to differentiate between these types of errors, so that users basing their applications off these tests will be much easier to service.  ></description> </Issue>

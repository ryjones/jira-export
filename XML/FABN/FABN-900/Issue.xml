CDATA This error comes from this call prior to trying to interact through a protobuf in calls such as sendProposal in the Peer {code:java} client.waitForReady(timeout, (err) => { {code} End applications have no idea which end point is the problem as this information is now lost. This call needs to be enhanced or the error captured by the caller so that the end point can be determined. Ideally it would also be really useful to know the reason it could not connect, eg ECONNREFUSED etc. This information used to come back before the waitForReady call was introduced.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA HLFabric and SDKs releases are not coupled.  For that reason SDK client is not required to cut a specific 2.3.0 release or branch when HLF 2.3.0 is released or maintained.  HLF 2.3.x will be supported out of the SDK 2.2 LTR branch.  The following is required to enable this strategy:  - update testing to include testing SDK 2.2  against 2.3 - update documentation to clarify that 2.2 is the SDK release compatible with 2.3  Testing should consider and cover new functionality in fabric 2.3  ></description> </Issue>

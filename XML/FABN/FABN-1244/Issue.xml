CDATA The `fabric-client` API has grown in complexity with many 'convenience' methods that combine actions.  In some cases this is at odds with some of the higher level abstractions in the `fabric-network` API that implements the Fabric programming model.  This story will break apart these compound methods into single action APIs * build protobuf * sign * send  All of the compound steps will be moved up into `fabric-network`     ></description> </Issue>

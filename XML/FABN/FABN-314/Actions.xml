CDATA this one is referring to the fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/marbles.js, which at one point was used to demonstrate the JSON based chaincode state handling, based on the chaincode that  ~denyeart  wrote. But the application code is not any different than using any other chaincodes. Nor does it really test anything additional that the rest of the integration test suite has not tested.  we should just delete the marbles.js and the chaincode.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for the comment.  We saw the couchDB approach but decided it was too heavy for our use-case. We opted for an in-memory store, much like the default in 2.0.  Â   Apparently we missed the note that the file based store is for testing only. Maybe this can be made more clear with warnings?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Client.getChannel() in the latest published snapshot of fabric-sdk-node no longer returns the first channel in the connection profile document when you don't pass in a channel name.  This code: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.1/fabric-client/lib/Client.js#L236  Seems to have been removed: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/fabric-client/lib/Client.js#L236  This is a breaking API change, and IMO needs to be fixed to avoid breaking applications built against Fabric v1.1.  ></description> </Issue>

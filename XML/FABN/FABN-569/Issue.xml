CDATA Currently as mentioned in FAB-9018, when using chaincode events only one event per block is being catched within the Node SDK when using registerChaincodeEvent. This has to do with the event name, we currently in our POC work around this by creating unique event names for every event. Although this work around won't be suitable when moving to a node application for every organisation.  The issue is occuring within _processChainCodeOnEvents although I haven't been able to understand exactly why it will only process one event (of a particular name) per block.  I would like to see this changed to allow registerChaincodeEvent to catch all events being raised from the chaincode.  Alongside of this improvement I propose that there be implementation/improvement of being able to catch these events in more then one node application, as current fabric-samples only show events being captured by the invoking node application.  These seem to me as inherent requirements by any decentralised applications where multiple parties don't trust each other and host their own web application that consume events generated by chaincode.  This functionality serves two purposes, the first being javascript callbacks and the second being to notify the user of successful invokes.       ></description> </Issue>

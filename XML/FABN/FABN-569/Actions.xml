CDATA I have finally resolved this issue.   As there are limited examples I was implementing register chaincode events within the invoke function, this lead to errors and bugs occuring where only the latest invoke in a block was registered.   When bringing the the registration out of the invoke it is able to listen to events raised in the chaincode when not unregistering. This should make it suitable for decentralised multiple node applications listening to events created by other organisations.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris , the last thing I heard was this fix must go into v0.5 and master. But I guess since we already branched the v0.6 branch, it should go into the v0.6 branch also? Let me know.   ~mastersingh24 , yes I am working on this. I am currently stuck on the fact that the v0.5 branch is so old, it does not have the changes that allow deployment with the newer version of Docker. The Docker installation is updated inside Vagrant to 1.12.1, which causes the error below. So I can't verify the change on v0.5. Once I get through this issue, I'll verify and publish.   dockercontroller  Start -> ERRO 063 start-could not start container API error (400): {"message":"starting container with HostConfig was deprecated since v1.10 and removed in v1.12"}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have been able to resolve the Docker issue above and verified this change on the Fabric05 branch. The required change has now been merged into the Fabric05 branch here: https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Blockchain/Fabric05/pull/16  I have also published the hfc version 0.5.1 to npm, which includes this change.  I am now working to put this change into master, in order to publish the hfc version 0.6.1 to npm. Thanks for your patience.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA I am using latest hfc v 0.6.5 and still getting incorrect chaincode id while using HFC chaincode deployment code. If I deploy the code from REST and then use the chaincode id to invoke and query trhough HFC code it works perfect. But deploying through HFC does not return a valid chaincode id that I can use for invoke and query. I am using latest hyperledger starter kit and then updated the HFC through npm.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  bmos299  The problem is in the node sdk (not in the fabric).   The node sdk builds the deploy transaction.  The deploy transaction is special.  In the deploy transaction the transaction id needs to equal the chaincode id.  However, the node sdk generates a uuid for the deploy transaction just as it does for other types of transactions.   Hence the problem.   When the peer is started and realizes it does not have the chaincode deployed, it uses the chaincode id and tries to find a transaction id that matches this value.....in this case it will not find  a match and hence the failure.  ></description> </Issue>

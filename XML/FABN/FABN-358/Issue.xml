CDATA For composer we are only interested in a single channel at the moment so want to work with the first channel definition in the CCP. However this doesn't appear possible to do and I had to access internal structures in order to do it. The code I have to do this is, but unsure of the order the channel names would be returned. {code} let channelNames = Object.keys(client._network_config._network_config.channels); const channel = client.getChannel(channelNames 0 ); {code} It would be handy to have an array of all the channel names defined in declaration order.  ></description> </Issue>

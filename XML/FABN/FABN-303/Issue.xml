CDATA "header" of the proposal used to be returned by some APIs that submit transaction proposals, so that the header field can be used in building the subsequent transaction object to send to the orderer. that has since been changed so that the header is built from the proposal object, so that it's not needed from the return object any longer. should remove that before more apps incidentally rely on that.

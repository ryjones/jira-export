CDATA Answered in Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66283689/the-constructor-for-hsmwalletmixin-in-hlf-1-4-doesnt-have-the-correct-variables   Looking at the source code the implementation is correct https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/4ca22aa1a70f464c3a5b9c259542aa7fee651061/fabric-network/lib/impl/wallet/hsmwalletmixin.js#L40  What is not correct are the type definitions which is the code snippet you have posted.  It's only going to be an issue if you are using typescript in which case you will just have to not use the HSMWalletMixin type to ensure typescript doesn't try to do any validation.    ></body> </Action>

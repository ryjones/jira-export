CDATA If you're using *fabric-ca-client*@1.4.1 (or any version before 1.4.6), I wouldn't expect you to see this issue. I believe this issue is in *fabric-ca-client* only and also affects fabric-client because it depends on fabric-ca-client.   I've raised an issue for the fact that our packages are depending on the latest versions of the other packages published by the fabric-sdk-node repo: FABN-1502. We want to change the logic there.   I've got a PR open and building for a 1.4.7 release which should resolve this issue, it's here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/pull/143|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/pull/143/checks  I'm hoping this is merged/published in the next couple of hours.   In the meantime, you should be able to use *fabric-ca-client@1.4.6-snapshot.87* in your package.jsons, which is fabric-ca-client@1.4.6 + this fix.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Heather - I tried again, with the updates you provided, updated the package.json with "^*1.4.6-snapshot.87"* and re-attempted the same, but got same issue..  i verified the fabric-ca-client in node_modules to ensure we have the right version pulled in and I could see the following lines are in package.json and it is usuing the same snapshot.   Please let me know if I need to add anything else?.     "_from": "fabric-ca-client@^1.4.6-snapshot.87",    "_id": "fabric-ca-client@1.4.6",  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~Lokeshwaran  A silly guess here. would you mind remove the "^" modifier before version and remove your `node_modules` folder entire and reinstall again?

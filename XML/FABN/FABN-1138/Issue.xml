CDATA The existing network e2e tests should exist and be maintained as scenario tests. Scenarios already exist for utilisation of the network APIs to interact with deployed chaincode; this task focusses on the conversion of the existing network scenario tests to be driven through the typescript definitions, in addition to rolling in any e2e tests that need to be ported.  All tests under /test/integration/network_e2e should be deleted as part of this issue  ></description> </Issue>

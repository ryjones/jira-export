CDATA Currently in 0.6, the client has no visibility into the health of the gRPC connection to the fabric. This has resulted in several issues that required us to pull in fabric, network, and service teams to look at packet traces to try and determine if the issue was blockchain related or caused by an issue with a packet getting dropped or a connection closed in between the client app and fabric.  The request is to expose the APIs in the HFC client to allow an application to query the connection state so the app can not only provide more information when logging errors, but is also able to determine when to close and/or reopen a connection.  There would be a hit to the documentation as well to explain the various connection states and how to transition between the various connection states.  ></description> </Issue>

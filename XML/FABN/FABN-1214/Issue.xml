CDATA When writing chaincode, the peer.Response object allows a REST-like status code to be returned to callers in addition to the Payload field (for successful transactions) or Message field when errors are encountered.  When a REST API is used to provide client applications access to the chaincode, it is ideal for the REST layer to pass back the status code returned by the chaincode directly to the client.  As such, there are scenarios in which the standard "200 OK" response is not appropriate.  For example, if a document gets created in the database it makes more sense to return a "201 Created", or if a document is deleted a "204 No Content" should be returned to indicate the object has been removed.  When chaincode is written to attempt to take advantage of these status codes, the Fabric Node SDK rejects the proposal responses returned from the peers and fails to add the peer endorsements to send to the Orderer because the status code does not exactly equal 200.  Instead, the Fabric Node SDK _SHOULD_ accept any status code within the 200-299 range as valid and add the endorsement to send to the orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

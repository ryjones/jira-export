CDATA If the system is extremely busy the .write() on the grpc stream may take longer than the request timeout. This give the wrong impression to the user that the problem is with the network not with the local system.Â   Keep the timers as is, however modify the return message to indicate that the local system is busy and was unable to handle the outbound request. Once the .write completes, set the error message to be the original request timeout.  ></description> </Issue>

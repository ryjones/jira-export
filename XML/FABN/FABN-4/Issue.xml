CDATA To prevent loss of requests, a consensus client needs to implement guaranteed delivery.  For this, a client needs to submit the request to at least f+1 consensus nodes and wait for their confirmation.  This is also true for solo orderer and CFT systems such as kafka (with both f=0).  The delivery can be guaranteed only when f+1 (or more) confirmations have been collected.  This also provides a mechanism for flow control, because consensus nodes can opt not to reply with a confirmation (and process further requests) while their fresh pool (see FAB-474) is at capacity.  Note that the requirement to confirm delivery from f+1 replicas implies that the submitting client/peer needs to know of at least f+1 (current) consensus nodes.  ></description> </Issue>

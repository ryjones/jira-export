CDATA The fabric-client uses an older version (^2.0.0) of klaw, where symlinks are not followed. With  https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw/pull/29  a fix has been merged and the klaw version was updated to 3.0.0.  I am running in that issue when using k8s.gcr.io/git-sync:v3.0.1 as sidecar container to synchronize chaincode. It pulls changes atomically by flipping a symlink in a subdirectory of the git worktree.  ></description> </Issue>

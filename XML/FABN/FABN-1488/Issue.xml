CDATA Contract.evaluateTransaction() does not use service discovery to select peers. This means that it will pick any peer that is a member of the channel to perform the query, regardless of whether or not that peer has the smart contract deployed which should be used to execute the query.  This results in random (depending on which peer gets selected) "cannot retrieve package for chaincode" errors when querying chaincode which is only installed on a subset of peers in a channel.  We should fix this behaviour so that only peers with the chaincode installed are used to handle queries.  ></description> </Issue>

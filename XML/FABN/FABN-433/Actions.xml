CDATA I have reproduced this issue on the following commit:  commit d40a0040e1d79fa7908d9f1b4c41aa15ff7e70ba Author: Caroline Daughtrey <cdaughtr@us.ibm.com> Date:   Fri Aug 26 15:06:09 2016 -0400  node-SDK: Change hfc Peer constructor description  There are two incomplete descriptions.  "config" should be "configuration" and the url description is incomplete.

CDATA I believe the issue is caused by the following commit:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/gitweb?p=fabric.git;a=commit;h=a98c59a15249d1da67ad162bb8fafe7ebbc70f92  This change removes the compiled protobuf files from the repository. This has an effect on the SDK unit tests as the unit tests clone into the fabric repo master branch to test deployment in network mode (packaging .tar.gz for Docker). Therefore, if the .pb.go files have been removed, the tests will likely fail.  ></body> </Action>

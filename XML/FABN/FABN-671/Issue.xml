CDATA Note that "thirdparty": "0.4.5" was removed in:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17203/2/fabric-client/package.json   Node SDK uses the thirdparty (couchdb) for tests.  Upon investigation it turns out that:  Â if it is `snapshot` release : - it pulls `latest` docker images if it is `release`: - it pulls `specific release version` docker images  I believe it should always use the specified thirdparty release (and automatically pull from dockerhub if needed), similar to fabric. Therefore thirdparty release should always remain in package.json until the next thirdparty update.  ></description> </Issue>

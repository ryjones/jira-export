CDATA If I try and specify a path to a keystore directory other than .hfc-key-store I hit the following problem, reported as follows ``` Error: Private key missing from key store. Can not establish the signing identity for user admin at _mspImpl.cryptoSuite.importKey.then.then (/home/vagrant/src/fabric-composer/node_modules/fabric-client/lib/User.js:260:11) ``` Looking at the code I see the following at line 228-232 or User.js ``` 		// FIXME: need to persist crypto settings, for now use the app-wide config setting 		this._mspImpl = new LocalMSP({ 			id: state.mspid, 			cryptoSuite: sdkUtils.newCryptoSuite() 		}); ``` I believe that because no path to the keystore I am using is passed to the created crypto suite it attempts to use the default at .hfc-key-store and because the admin private key hasn't been stored there this causes the problem.   ></description> </Issue>

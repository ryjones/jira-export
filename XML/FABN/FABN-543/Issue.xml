CDATA The decodeFabricMSPConfig() function in BlockDecoder in the Node SDK tries to deserialize tls_root_certs and tls_intermediate_certs from the mspConfigProto.FabricMSPConfig. This however is undefined since the tls_root_certs and tls_intermediate_certs are not an actual part of the FabricMSPConfig()  Â   *Edit:* It looks like the protos are out of sync. The proto file on Node was the latest edited file. Nov 2017 and in py SDK it's Mar 2017  ></description> </Issue>

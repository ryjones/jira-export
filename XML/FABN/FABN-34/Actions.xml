CDATA The problem was due to the script sdk/node/bin/run-unit-tests.sh using "ping" command to resolve "localhost" into IP address in function resolvHost(). On a host with IPv6 addresses, localhost might resolve to IP address ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1, which breaks the script.  The following change allows the test run to finish:  bq. -   : ${SDK_MEMBERSRVC_ADDRESS:="localhost:7054"} bq. -   : ${SDK_PEER_ADDRESS:="localhost:7051"} bq. +   : ${SDK_MEMBERSRVC_ADDRESS:="127.0.0.1:7054"} bq. +   : ${SDK_PEER_ADDRESS:="127.0.0.1:7051"}  However, there are multiple "LedgerError - ResourceNotFound: ledger: resource not found" during the tests. Note that node-sdk-unit-tests also have multiple failures on x86. Log files for both zLinux and x86 are attached.   ^node-sdk-unit-tests.log.s390x    ^node-sdk-unit-tests.log.x86    ></body> </Action>

CDATA So I think we need to test the following environments: - inside Docker hosted in LinuxOne - in the native LinuxOne environment   ~rameshthoomu  I believe the CI job for s390 is running inside Docker is that right?  ~latitiah  have you been running SDK samples on s390? is that in LinuxOne or Docker?  ></body> </Action>

This was already implemented. On every sdk-node commit CI runs verify and merge job. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-sdk-node/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-s390x/ and https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-sdk-node/job/fabric-sdk-node-merge-s390x/   ></body> </Action>

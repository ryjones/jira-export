CDATA let's do this: - all the queryXXX methods will by default target the first peer in the channel object's list of peers - add an optional "target" parameter to the end of the arguments list, which always takes a singular peer object (need to check to make sure it's not an array) - get rid of the primary peer concept and remove the getPrimaryPeer() method  ></body> </Action>

CDATA looking better, now you are down to 2 different interfaces...     sendTransactionProposal() is taking the peers via a "targets" field inside the 1st parameter. {code:java} sendTransactionProposal({targets:  target , chaincodeId: 'asdf', txId: 'asdf', args:   });{code}    while all the channel stat like things are providing it as the 1st or 2nd argument    {code:java} queryBlock(blockNumber, target); queryInfo(target); queryTransaction(tx_id, target); etc...{code}       regardless, this is much better. Thanks!  Oh, and I'm not too concerned that we only get 1 target, that's okay.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA I am testing a scenario to add an Org to an existing channel and remove the Org after doing some invokes. We were able to add an org successfully but when we fetch the updated config block using getChannelConfig() , we don't see the newly added Org in the config channel block.  As a result of this issue, you can only update the channel once.You cannot add an additional org, remove an existing org or do any kind of channel update.  Issue can be reproduced using following steps. # Create a network with 2 Org , 2 Peers per Org. # Add a new Org by updating the channel using configtxlator and  getChannelConfig() . # Join a Peer to the new Org. # Config block returned from getChannelConfig() doesn't contain the newly added Org.  Attached  ^channel-config.js contains the code for adding an Org and removing an Org.     ></description> </Issue>

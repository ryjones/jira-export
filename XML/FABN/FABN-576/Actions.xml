CDATA Yes, still required, In the case of HSM, because there is no private key you would return the privateKeyObj as required for createUser, or nothing at all. What I am looking for is exporting an existing user that can be directly accepted by createUser (but in the case of HSM it would be acceptable for the end user code to create the privateKeyObj).   ></body> </Action>

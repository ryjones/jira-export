CDATA  ~davidkel  so for the constructor returning a promise, it's implementation specific and not absolutely required. if your implementation of the KeyValueStore interface does not need the constructor to return a promise you don't have to.  not sure about your 2nd question. In your sample snippet above (the last one) you are already using the same impl (HLFWalletProxy) for both the KeyValueStore and CryptoKeyStore's super class. are you saying you want to use the same KeyValueStore instance object for both? that's currently not possible but not sure why it's a problem?  ></body> </Action>

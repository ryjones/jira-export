CDATA The directory  ../fabric/sdk/node/test/unit/  contains unit tests for the Node SDK APIs. An audit of the tests completed by Janet Wolf showed certain APIs are completely absent from the unit test coverage.   1.Audit sdk/node/test/unit/ to identify APIs covered and omitted from unit test coverage. - Janet Wolf did this by comparing the APIs exposed by sdk/node/doc to the APIs called in the parts in sdk/node/test/unit.   Complete. 2.Write test cases or enhance existing test cases to add omitted APIs to sdk/node/test/unit/. - Janet Wolf and Nishi Nidamarty have written such test cases.  Complete.  See FAB-594 for class member coverage. 3.Review test cases. - Janet and Nishi reviewed the test cases and identified improvements.  Complete. 4.Integrate Allen Bailey's sdk/node/test/unit changes with the enhanced test cases. The tests in sdk/node/test/unit are designed to run on a laptop in the predefined vagrant environment.  As such, many values such as URLs are hard coded in the test case.  Working independently, Allen Bailey has been generalizing the tests to use environment variables for test case configuration.  This will allow us to run the unit tests on other platforms such as HSBN and Bluemix.   Allen Bailey will integrate his changes with the tests written by Janet and Nishi.   See FAB-595. 5.Check changes into source control.  Not started.  See FAB-595. 6.Test integrated changes on Fabric .6.  Not started.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a (node) sdk user, I want to keey my private key safe, and user my private key offline.  Current SDK will generate a key pairs when a user try to enroll himself at fabric-ca. However, generate privateKey at SDK side seems not secure sometimes. SDK should provide the capability so that a user can generate a key pairs (or use existing key pairs) at local and call enroll() with a CSR.  ></description> </Issue>

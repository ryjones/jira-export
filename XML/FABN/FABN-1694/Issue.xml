<Issue id="46498" key="FABN-1694" number="1694" project="10604" reporter="icarrascol" creator="icarrascol" type="10004" summary="long response times when endorsers are down" description="hello, consider having an endorsing peer down, the sdk takes 3 seconds by default to wait for an answer of this peer every time a request is done. If more endorsing peers are down, it means 3 seconds more of waiting from what i tested. If i have 2 peers down a request takes +6 seconds, this means the check for the endorser status is being done in a sequence instead of in parallel. This behavior is a big hit to the performance of an application as on my case normal requests with all peers up take 1.8 seconds, a request with an endorsing peer down takes 4.8 seconds, and obviously more endorsingpeers down take +3s each. these endorsing peers that are down are not even required to endorse the transaction, but the status check is done at the start from what the logs say." priority="3" status="10300" created="2021-01-18 13:52:20.0" updated="2021-01-27 14:22:27.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="60441" archived="N"/>

CDATA In the generated documentation, in the class Remote:  (1) typo Is now: The Remote class represents {color:#205081}a the {color}base class for all remote {color:#d04437}nodes,{color} Peer, {color:#d04437}Orderer , {color}and MemberServicespeer.  Should be:  The Remote class represents {color:#d04437}the {color}base class for all remote {color:#d04437}nodes:{color} Peer, {color:#d04437}Orderer{color}, and MemberServicespeer.  (2) ambiguity in this description:  opts Object that may contain options to override the global settings {color:#205081}pem{color} The certificate file, in PEM format, to use with the gRPC protocol (that is, with TransportCredentials).  Required when using the grpcs protocol.  (2a) It's not clear opts is an optional parameter.  The code remote.js is treating it as an optional parameter. (2b) It's not clear if 'The certificate file ... TransportCredentials).' is an example of an opts object or a new definition of an opts object.   (2c) the PEM option is described, but the code seems to recognize 'ssl-target-name-override', 'default-authority'.   Shouldn't these be described also?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The install of chain code is not for a specific channel, just for a peer. The chain code could then be instantiated on any channel. The connection profile tags a peer by the role that peer will have within the channel. So at chain code install time we do not have a channel to look at to find a peers role.  I guess we could default to the first channel found ?  ></body> </Action>

I only considered a single channel per CCP as this is what Composer currently does.  That makes me think that an install should be able to select the channel as the installation of chaincode is usually specific to the channel it is going to be running on. It could also take an array as well if you want to install the chaincode onto multiple channels. If no channel is given, then it's debatable whether an error should be thrown or the first channel in the CCP is chosen.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA How about on install of chain code I build a list of all the peers in the current clients assigned organization ?  On instantiate, since this is on a channel, will build a list based on the channel's peers that are endorsers or chain code query and in the current organization?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Sorry Bret, I didn't see your comment until after I posted mine. For install it probably isn't too big a deal just to install the chaincode on every peer in your organisation.  For instantiate in Fabric 1.0 you only need to send instantiate to 1 peer in the channel that is either an endorser or chaincode query. But I gather there may be some changes coming in 1.1 that might affect this ?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Oh right I forgot about those changes coming, the whole instantiate is going to change... I think it is going to be more like the create channel, with all the signatures. So for now I will not make any changes to the channel instantiate.  I guess I could look for channel id in the request object and if that is there get the peers from that or default to all peers in the org  ></body> </Action>

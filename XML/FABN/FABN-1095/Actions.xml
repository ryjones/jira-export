CDATA Should the idea of a wallet for tokens be integrate with the fabric-network (programming model) high level 'wallet' used for fabric network identity artifacts.Â  I see a 'token' as a fabric specific artifact and seems like an asset that should be in a wallet. This would provide high level access to the tokens and management while keeping the fabric-client (low level NodeSDK) for the building and executing the token transaction (fabric interactions).   ~denyeart    ~andrew-coleman   ~sstone1    ~odowdaibm   I think as we add new functions like this to the SDK, that we keep the low level just for direct interactions with the fabric network work and build the high level to assist the application developers at the same time (the high level has the boiler plate code they will not have to write). Developers will see just one way to do things.  And speaking of just one way, the interaction testing would only be based on the high level package API's.  ></body> </Action>

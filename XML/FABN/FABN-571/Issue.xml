The default will be to have a transaction listener timeout, with the other listener types the default will be to not have a timer running. The timer will start when the listener is registered. The default amount of time will be based on a configuration option. The user will be allowed to pass in the amount of time requested in the `options` parameter of &apos;timeout&apos;. When the timeout parameter is present in the listener registration this will imply that a timeout should be started with that amount of time." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-01-10 14:53:51.0" updated="2019-07-30 17:58:47.0" resolutiondate="2019-07-30 17:58:47.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="34302"/>

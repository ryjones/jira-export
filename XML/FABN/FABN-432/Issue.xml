CDATA Today's clone of fabric-sdk-node deposits a README.md file in its fabric-sdk-node directory.  The readme has this to say about documentation:  _HFC objects and reference documentation For a high-level design specificiation for Fabric SDKs of all languages, visit  this google doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5RtIBMW9fZpli37E5Li5_Q9ve3BnQ4q3gWmGZj6Sv4/edit?usp=sharing) (Work-In-Progress).  The referenced documentation is useful, but users want to see the generated documentation, too.   To see that, you need to issue this command from the fabric-sdk-node directory:   *gulp doc  * To run gulp doc, you need to first issue this command:   *npm install -g gulp   /* or maybe sudo npm install -g gulp */  *_  These steps ought to be described in the readme file.   How to recreate: 1.cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger 2.git clone http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/fabric-sdk-node 3.cd fabric-sdk-node 4.Inspect README.md  ></description> </Issue>

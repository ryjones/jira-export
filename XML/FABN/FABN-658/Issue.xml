CDATA The node sdk emits events from chaincode even if that transaction fails to be committed. This in itself is probably not a problem, the problem is wrt to listeners who are not able to determine if the event resulted from a failed or successful transaction.  I know that it's possible to listen for transaction events as well as chaincode events but as the order in which these events arrive is not defined events may not always be emitted it isn't possible to tie the 2 together without causing a potential memory leak. (ie tracking which txns fail in order to tag the events with information about success or failure as you could only clear out tracking a txn when the event is received and if no event is received this txn tracking will grow)  Â   ></description> </Issue>

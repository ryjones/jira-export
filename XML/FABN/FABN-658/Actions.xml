<Action id="33023" issue="20894" author="wlahti" type="comment" body=" ~davidkel  I think the comment for SetEvent() in interfaces.go is currently incorrect. The block will include the chaincode event for each transaction (if one has been set) whether the transaction is valid or not. The comment should be updated and the SDKs should filter out events if the transaction is invalid.

CDATA Discussed this bug with  ~denyeart  for the ledger perspective,  ~muralisr  for the chaincode perspective, and  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  for the SDK perspective.  The consensus is that:  1) chaincode events for invalid transactions should be filtered out on the SDK side. This is because the chaincode event is part of the block itself and cannot be removed at the time a transaction is deemed invalid due to a MVCC_READ_CONFLICT error, for example  2) the comment in interfaces.go is incorrect and should be updated (which I'll handle with a new JIRA item, FAB-6777)  ></body> </Action>

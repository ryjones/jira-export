CDATA If a user deploys chaincode using v2 lifecycle and indicates that 'init_required' there is no way for the user to send a transaction with the required 'is_init' setting on the proposal.  We could add this ability to the fabric-network/transaction class in a similar way as the 'setTransient()' where it could be an addition call on the transaction instance and then be passed to the low level to tell fabric.  ></description> </Issue>

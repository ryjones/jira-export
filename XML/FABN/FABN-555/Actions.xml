CDATA I suspect that the failure occurs in fabric-client/lib/impl/NetworkConfig_1_0.js where the TLS certificates are verified regardless of whether this is a TLS or mutual TLS enabled network.  I also suspect that this error would not be seen if certificates and key files are always supplied regardless of security setup. Please add a test scenario that covers the case when a network does not require crypto material.  ></body> </Action>

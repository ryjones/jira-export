CDATA *Node SDK commit:* 6555757137cc9d3754ef04074d2ecaaf75bfc9af  *Test scenario:*  Given a non-TLS fabric network. When peers create and join a channel using the CLI And chaincode is installed using the CLI And a user queries the chaincode using NodeSDK  Fails: "Error: A crypto suite has not been assigned to this client"  Note: If one uses the NodeSDK instead of the CLI when creating and joining the channel, the suspicion is that the failure would occur at that point in the test scenario. This is error is being seen when using the PTE test tool for test case FAB-10135.  This is causing failures in CI for over 50 regression test cases.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, when deploying chaincode via Node-sdk, the CouchDB index definition files can be anywhere as long as the ` metadataPath|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/global.html#ChaincodeInstallRequest ` is set properly.Â  This behavior is different from the chaincode deployment via peer command, and it (node-sdk behavior) should be documented somewhere in the node-sdk documentation.  ></description> </Issue>

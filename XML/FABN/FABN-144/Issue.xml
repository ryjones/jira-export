CDATA Node and npm versions mentioned in the *README* under *build-and-test* (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node#build-and-test) are wrong. It should be corrected as per the package.json , else tests are failing.  {code:java} "node": ">=6.7.0", "npm": ">=3.0.0" {code}  Logs for reference.  It is good to have *Troubleshoot section* : In some cases the npm installed using apt-get could be an older version than what is required and normally installed along with Node. To resolve this version compatibility issue, Download and extarct the nodejs tar from here https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.1 and set *bin* to your PATH   ></description> </Issue>

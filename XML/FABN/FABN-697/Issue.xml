CDATA We need a way to get the following info via GRPC.  Perhaps some/all are there but couldn't find them.  The same validation as is done for processTransaction should be performed.  – GET /chain/blocks/block_number – GET /chain – GET /network/peers – GET /transactions/uuid_number  These are the REST endpoints for which we need GRPC now, but would be best to expose all of them.  ></description> </Issue>

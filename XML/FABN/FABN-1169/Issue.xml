CDATA Seem the e2e test certificates have expired, these need to be replaced to enable any code delivery as the build will fail every time otherwise.  Whilst there, it should be made possible to generate all certs required for tests using a script file, which can later be rolled into the test/build process so that this never occurs again.  ></description> </Issue>

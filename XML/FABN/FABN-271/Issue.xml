CDATA I download the latest node sdk from git as the published npm modules are too old. I link fabric-client and fabric-ca-client in my node_modules directory to the fabric-client and fabric-ca-client in the downloaded sdk.  I found that the node-sdk doesn't load CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js from the lib/impl directory in fabric-client and failed. I can get it to load but if actually finds it in the node_modules directory of the node sdk itself where a copy of fabric-client and fabric-ca-client are placed.   This doesn't seem right to me as it is looking for dependencies outside of the fabric-client module and should actually find the dependencies inside the fabric-client code as it is there.  The problem appears to be in the config definition of the node-sdk. {code} 	"crypto-suite-software": { 		"EC": "fabric-client/lib/impl/CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js" 	}, 	"crypto-suite-hsm": { 		"EC": "fabric-client/lib/impl/bccsp_pkcs11.js" 	}, 	"key-value-store": "fabric-client/lib/impl/FileKeyValueStore.js", {code} The code in fabric-client will invoke a nodejs require on these paths to the files but because the code itself is in the fabric-client/lib directory it won't be able to find the modules in the impl directory so the require then goes to the parent directory (which is the root of the node sdk itself) node_modules directory where it will find the files because copies of the whole fabric-client and fabric-ca-client modules exist.  ></description> </Issue>

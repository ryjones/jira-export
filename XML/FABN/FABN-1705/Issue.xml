CDATA If the request.proposal argument has ByteBuffer type fields (which they typically will be at runtime), the decode process within Channel.buildEnvelope() changes the mark index for those ByteBuffers. This results in subsequent calls using the same request instance to produce different results. This appears to be a bug (or at least undesirable behaviour) in protobuf.js.  Affects the v1.4 SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

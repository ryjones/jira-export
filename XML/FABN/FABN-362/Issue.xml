CDATA In composer when a transaction is submitted to a set of peers, composer will then listen for events from all the peers it is allowed to connect to waiting for transaction committed events. Once it receives those events it returns to the caller. A CCP can contain peers in a channel for peers in multiple organisations, but the likelyhood is that you can only listen for events of peers in your own organisation. I used the following code to be able to register event listeners for just those peers as follows {code} static getEventHubs(client) { let eventHubs =   ; let orgConfig = HLFConnection.getOrgConfig(client); if (orgConfig) { let peers = orgConfig.getPeers(); peers.forEach((peer) => { eventHubs.push(client.getEventHub(peer.getName())); }); } return eventHubs; } {code} This is another helper method that might be worth providing above having to get the ClientConfig then the organisation  ></description> </Issue>

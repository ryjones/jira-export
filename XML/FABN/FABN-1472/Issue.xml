CDATA Enable the fabric-network applications to provide the signature for a fabric request rather than NodeSDK signing the request with provided identity. The identity provided will have to have a certificate, but will not have to access to a private key.  This will require a different flow for the application, instead of just a submit, a buildSubmit will be needed prior to the actual submit to provide the application with the request. The application will then be responsible for getting the signature. The application will then provide that request and the signature on the actual submit.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Whenever a merge of master is done, the docs published at  https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io  are published. This is a problem as it will include information about unreleased capabilities. Ideally a user of this site should be able to get release specific information ie 1.1, 1.2 and as well as master, but it should default to the latest released level of fabric.  Suggestions from duplicate jira  It is observed that Node.JS SDK documentation always points to the master/latest. Here are some thoughts:  - Maintain different version for the documentation OR - Mention from what version the API is available, from what version the API is deprecated else it would be really confusing for the developers  This Jira should also result in a new feature jira for the future of the reference docs for node-sdk  ></description> </Issue>

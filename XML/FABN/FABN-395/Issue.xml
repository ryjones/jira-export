CDATA Comparing fabric-sdk-node/coverage/lcov-report to fabric-sdk-node/docs/gen, it is clear fabric-sdk-node contains more classes and methods than are documented.  fabric-sdk-node/buld/tasks/doc.js has not been updated in awhile.   Chat with Jim Zhang: jjjjibm 3:35 PM Looking at build/tasks/doc.js, I see files not included: fabric-client/lib/msp/* fabric-client/lib/config.fs, .. EventHub.js .. REmote.js .. hash.js .. utils-x509.js .. utils.js   fabric-client/lib/impl/ bccsp_pkcs11.js fabric-client/lib/impl/ecdsa/* fabric-client/lib/impl/aes/* Any particular reason? Maybe the "utils" don't need to be included?  jimthematrix 4:13 PM  only these need to be added:  .. EventHub.js .. REmote.js  fabric-client/lib/impl/ bccsp_pkcs11.js fabric-client/lib/impl/ecdsa/* fabric-client/lib/impl/aes/*  jjjjibm 4:24 PM No MSP?  jimthematrix 4:25 PM that's internal class  jjjjibm 4:25 PM Cool, thanks  jimthematrix 4:25 PM not ready as API for v1.0 yw  How to recreate: 1.Clone fabric-sdk-node 2.gulp doc to generate doc  fabric-sdk-node/docs 3.gulp test to generate test coverage report fabric-sdk-node/coverage 4.compare coverage report to generated documents  ></description> </Issue>

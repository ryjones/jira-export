CDATA The community has tended to create just one key value store and use it for both the state store and the crypto store. We should make that usage pattern easier. We could do anyone or all of the following to assist the users. * We could set the state store and crypto store to the default when the client object is created. Both could be overridden later. * We could add a new 'Client' instance method 'setDefaultKeyValueStores' that would create the default key value store and set it as the state store and create a crypto suite and set it as the crypto store. * We could update the 'setStateStore' to also create the crypto suite and set the crypto store to the same store passed in if the crypto suite is null. The application could always set crypto suite later. * We should remove the creating of crypto suite in 'User' when one does not exist and required that the 'Client' object be properly initialized that is creating the user.  ></description> </Issue>

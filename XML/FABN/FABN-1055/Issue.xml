CDATA     As we known, there must be exactly one ordering system channel for an ordering service, and any member who can access to the ordering system channel could see all of the channels' creation information, but now there is no method to query all the information of the channels which are connected to the ordering service.       Hence, Fabric SDK Node could provide a new Client <async> queryChannels(orderer) method, which is able to query all the channels' name of the target orderer. Here, the parameter orderer is a name representing the orderer node to which the channels' query request is sent.  If this method is provided, the administrator of the ordering service could get all of the channel creations information and check whether a channel has been created.  ></description> </Issue>

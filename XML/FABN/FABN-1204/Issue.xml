CDATA If the latest block when a listener is connected has 1 or more transactions in it that emits chaincode events then these chaincode events are emitted which is not expected.  Consider an application that is only interested in events from transactions it sends while it is up. The application starts but is user driven as to when transactions are submitted but as soon as it connects it receives events from previous transactions it's not interested in or may have even processed previously.  I suspect this issue will also apply to the block listener as well.  For listeners that don't use replay the listener should be attached after the eventhub has been connected.  ></description> </Issue>

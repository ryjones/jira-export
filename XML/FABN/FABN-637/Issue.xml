CDATA The node SDK provides 2 helper functions to look at endorsement responses channel.verifyProposalResponse & channel.compareProposalResponseResults  I'm struggling to understand how a client could effectively use these. In our code all we do is log a warning if either return false but still send all the endorsements to the orderer.  The reason for only logging is that the client has no idea what the endorsement policy is so cannot make a decision about problems with these responses. Also the client shouldn't terminate or not pass the information to the orderer if an endorsement doesn't verify or the RW Sets don't match as this could be a malicious peer and by doing so the malicious peer could effectively stop a transaction from being committed.   I was wondering if there was any guidance on this or have I misunderstood something ?   ></description> </Issue>

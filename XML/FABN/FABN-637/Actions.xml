CDATA  channel.verifyProposalResponse|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Channel.html#verifyProposalResponse__anchor   - you can use this to make sure that the proposal response was signed by a legitimate member of an organization which is part of the channel.  If this returns false for any proposal response, it should not be included in the proposal set sent to the orderer(s).   channel.compareProposalResponseResults|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Channel.html#compareProposalResponseResults__anchor  - while you are correct that the client does not explicitly know the endorsement policy, it likely has some clue implicitly based on which endorsers it actually sends proposal to.  Of course when you build the client, you may actually have knowledge of the endorsement policy so you can use this to make sure you actually get enough correct endorsements in that case     ></body> </Action>

CDATA That's useful to know about the verifyProposalResponse. I can look to removing it from the set, however wouldn't it also be handled by fabric as well ?     For the compare, Composer won't know the endorsement policy unfortunately. In that case it would have to be part of some meta-data in the connection profile. Even if it did the issue with the compare is that it tells you if they compare or don't compare but nothing else which doesn't really help. Again I assume the fabric would also perform checks anyway ?  ></body> </Action>

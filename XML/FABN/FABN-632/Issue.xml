CDATA When we develop a deterministic blockchain application, we need a convenient mechanism that a client can wait until the results of a prior transaction had been committed into the ledger. This is because endorsement has dependency to the latest state of the ledger.  While the end-to-end demo mentions this requirement, it actually sleeps during a few seconds. This is convenient but dangerous programming practice since it can introduce intermittent behavior into the whole application.  In theory, this can be checked by polling with chaincode query, but in practice, SDK should provide a convenient API which allows a client to wait until transaction results have been committed into the ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

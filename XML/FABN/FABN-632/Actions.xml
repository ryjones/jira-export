<Action id="20265" issue="13897" author="inatatsu" type="comment" body=" ~jimthematrix  Thank you very much for your helpful information. Will FAB-896 add a separate event API?

For example, an extra synchronization flag in the request for Chain.sendTransaction()." created="2017-01-05 05:11:31.0" updateauthor="inatatsu" updated="2017-01-05 05:11:31.0"/>

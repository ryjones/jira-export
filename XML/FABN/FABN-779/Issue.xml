CDATA The TCert's usage with attributes is a going to become a critical aspect for controlling roles and privileges in the chaincode.  The considerations are: 1.  As attributes are dynamically changed, how can the TCerts change and not become stale. 2.  How can I delete a batch of TCerts if they are stale. 3.  How can I get a batch of TCerts with different attributes tied to the certs.  It would be nice to do one call and specifiy which certs should have what attributes, e.g.   alice.getUserCert( "role", "account", 10 ,  "role", "account", "company","acme", 20  function (err, aliceCert)  This would mean I want a total of 30 TCerts. 10 with one attribute and 20 with two attributes.  There is a lot of good detail at this link: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/tech/attributes.md  ></description> </Issue>

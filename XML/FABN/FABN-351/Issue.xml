CDATA For ease of reading,   Is now: * from the fabric-ca folder, launch the following command to start the fabric-ca server. The ec.pem and ec-key.pem {color:#d04437}certificates sets {color}up the fabric-ca server as the trusted root that the Peer nodes have been statically configured as a temporary measure. In other words, the Peers will be able to trust any user certificates that have been signed by the fabric-ca server. This is important because the endorser code inside the Peer will need to validate the user certificate issued by fabric-ca before using it to verify the signature of the transaction proposal. * bin/fabric-ca server start -ca testdata/ec.pem -ca-key testdata/ec-key.pem -config testdata/testconfig.json  Should be: from the fabric-ca folder, launch the following command to start the fabric-ca server. * bin/fabric-ca server start -ca testdata/ec.pem -ca-key testdata/ec-key.pem -config testdata/testconfig.json  The ec.pem and ec-key.pem  {color:#d04437}certificates set{color} up the fabric-ca server as the trusted root that the Peer nodes have been statically configured as a temporary measure. In other words, the Peers will be able to trust any user certificates that have been signed by the fabric-ca server. This is important because the endorser code inside the Peer will need to validate the user certificate issued by fabric-ca before using it to verify the signature of the transaction proposal. *   Another thing: that the Peer nodes have been statically configured as a temporary measure.  Something seems missing in that phrase?  configured {color:#654982}to use {color}as a temporary measure?  ></description> </Issue>

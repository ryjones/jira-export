CDATA I think that the bug here is actually that it returns to you "make sure the chaincode foo has been successfully defined on channel default and try again" because that error string is thrown from within the  endorser code|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/core/endorser/endorser.go#L393  but it shouldn't had even reached that place since discovery didn't return a descriptor.     Anyway, this seems to me like an SDK bug.         ~davidkel   /  ~bestbeforetoday   what do you make of this?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA There was a Fabric bug that caused similar errors, but the fix should be included in v2.3.0: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-18194  We're certainly not seeing this behaviour in scenario tests but we don't run any test networks with only a single peer, so it's possible that's a trigger.  Could you try using the v2.2.6 SDK just some of the dependency updates that includes solve the issue for you?  ></body> </Action>

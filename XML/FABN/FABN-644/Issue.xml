CDATA Channel.QueryBlock* and Channel.QueryTransaction returns a fully decoded block/transaction. When a client wants to verify the contents, for example, hashes and signatures for the block, it needs binary representation (or encoded) of the block. There is no API to encode it from the decoded data, and the decoded data might lose some details (like nanosec in timestamp). This might prevent us from restoring the binary of the block.  As a simple solution, I'd like to propose adding an option to these methods which skips decoding the block/transaction to leave it for clients.  ></description> </Issue>

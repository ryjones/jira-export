CDATA The build in master currently looks at the fabric-client package.json version to try to determine what version of fabric to test against. This is changed so that it looks in the top level package for specific properties rather than version to make control more flexible  Also the changelog script failed now the Jira issue ids have changed. The change is not perfect so may still require some sort of manual intervention but better than it was as it was broken.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The connection profile has been changed to now insert brackets for the pem:  shown below.   In the past there were no brackets.  The brackets are causing the register call to fail: `const secret = await ca.register({enrollmentID: 'user1', role: 'client' }, adminIdentity);`  With the following message: `Failed to register user "user1": TypeError  ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE : The "options.ca" property must be one of type string, Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received type object`  The code already treats this key as an array so adding the brackets is creating an array of an array.  Checkout _buildCAfromConfig(ca_info) in Client.js   ></body> </Action>

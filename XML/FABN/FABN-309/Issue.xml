CDATA Vlaunch VM running Ubuntu.  Firefox browser for reading coverage reports. node-SDK: commit 691af6351dcd7b19c90572fce546990c1ccc626d fabric: commit 4cc8d04f900cd2b96e8204c67f257345c3612aad fabric-ca: commit 70ae36d9204b174efb85c3376aab9bf830153d04     ></environment> <description><! CDATA Jim Zhang has re-organized the fabric-sdk-node test directory.  See issue FAB-2164 and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5943/ for the story of the re-organization.  He also switched the unit test coverage report to a Coberatura xml file.  Insofar as the Coberatura report doesn't render in a browser (missing xml style file), we miss the old coverage report.   Solution:  The solution is to generate both.   I changed the test-headless reporter configuration to  reporters:   'lcov', 'json', 'text', 'text-summary', 'coberatura' .     Edit: In my testing, whether I enter 'gulp test' or 'gulp test-headless', I see the old HTML coverage report.    ></description> </Issue>

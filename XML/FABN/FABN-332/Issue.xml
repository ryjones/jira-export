CDATA There are several integration tests of Node.js SDK release branch are failing due to the change in error response message in Fabric V1.1 peer component. {code:java} not ok 841  Failed to get error could not find chaincode with name --- operator: fail at: checkResults (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/upgrade.js:229:7) stack: |- Error:  Failed to get error could not find chaincode with name at Test.assert  as _assert  (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/tape/lib/test.js:212:54) at Test.bound  as _assert  (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/tape/lib/test.js:64:32) at Test.fail (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/tape/lib/test.js:277:10) at Test.bound  as fail  (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/tape/lib/test.js:64:32) at checkResults (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/upgrade.js:229:7) at Client.newDefaultKeyValueStore.then.then.then.then.then.then (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/test/integration/upgrade.js:140:3) at <anonymous> at process._tickDomainCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:228:7) {code} *ex*: when chaincode is not installed and tried to upgrade/instantiate, the peer error response message in v1.1 now is "*no such file or directory",* where as peer response in earlier versions V1.0 was - *could not find chaincode with name* (for upgrade) - *cannot get package for the chaincode to be instantiated* (for instantiate)  +Test files effected:+ _test/integration/instantiate.js_ _test/integration/upgrade.js_     This changes are causing tests to fail after upgrading fabric  to v1.1. So, application will see failures in live upgrade scenario, and should make adjustments in their expectations (response parsing). This should be documented in the upgrade section for v1.1.  ></description> </Issue>

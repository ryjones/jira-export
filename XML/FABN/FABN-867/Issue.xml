CDATA There is no possibility to sign proposal / payload expect of using UserContext and SigningIdentity functionality . It would be good to have functionality to send signed proposal / payload and it doesn't matter how it was signed.( on mobile device or in browser ) Important that user has to be registered and enrolled and algorithms which are used should be the same. (it can be enrolled directly from the fabric-ca).It will make SDK more flexible.  I've already did this locally and would be glad to contribute.  ></description> </Issue>

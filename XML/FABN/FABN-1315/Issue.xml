CDATA When using Private Data Collections there is a requirement to send proposals containing private data only to orgs that are part of the private data collection. If it were sent to all orgs then there is the potential for orgs not part of the PDC to have visibility of that data (even if it is in the transientMap) and the level of trust may not extend to hoping that org doesn't try to capture this information.  When a submit is made it should be possible to list the orgs that should only receive this data or discovery should be enhanced to capture private data collections so the decision can be made automatically.   ></description> </Issue>

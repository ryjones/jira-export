CDATA thanks for taking the time to write this up  ~kraemer . Definitely agree with you this area needs to be fixed. so the problem with FabricCAClientImpl constructor and User.setEnrollment() both requiring that weird KVSImplClass and the corresponding opts parameters, is to construct a CryptoSuite instance needed to handle certs and keys. after thinking this over, I've concluded that the design should really be that we give the application more control on constructing the CryptoSuite instance and setting it to the objects that need it (ca client and user). in addition, we shouldn't try to serialize the settings related to the crypto suite as part of the user enrollment persistence, but instead leave that knowledge (what's the right key algo, security level, hashing algo etc.) to the application to manage.  Doing the above would eliminate the weird parameters from the APIs and make it easier for applications to keep track of where CryptoSuite instances are constructed and used.  Please let us know if you have more input on this latest thinking. thanks again for your contribution to making the SDKs better. And feel free to review 8905 that  ~cdaughtr  just uploaded  ></body> </Action>

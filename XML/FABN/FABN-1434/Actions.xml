CDATA I'm really not clear on why this is happening. fabric-protos has been published and it has a README, here;  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/fabric-protos/README.md  which is the same place as it for fabric-network etc. I can't see anything in the top level package.json that defines the location for the fabric-network package, differently to say the fabric-protos package.  I'll look into whether we run the publish command for fabric-protos differently, but other than that, I'm stumped.  ></body> </Action>

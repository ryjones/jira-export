CDATA  ~nfrunza  If such an API were added it would need to be added on both sdk side and peer side.  And I don't think you could get the chaincode source from 'the network' since only a hash of the chaincode is stored on the channel. But maybe you could get it from individual peers that have installed it.  Let's get opinion from  ~jyellick  and  ~sykesm   since they are working on future of lifecycle and chaincode deployment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA If HLExplorer wants to add a repository to store chaincode packages, that's fine and then you would just create code to actually parse packages.   We are not going to add an API to the peer which will retrieve chaincode packages.  These packages are made available out of band in the first place.  And as  ~sykesm  stated, chaincode source will not always be available on the peer.  ></body> </Action>

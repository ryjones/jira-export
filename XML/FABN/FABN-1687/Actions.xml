CDATA my test is even worse. if a peer is down, the whole fabric network cannot submit transactions any more. the crash fault tolerance test makes a critical failure.  it can be reproduced by the following setup and operations.  1) org1 has private data collection named Org1PrivateCollection.  2) peer0.org1 is an anchor peer.  3) set discovery options {code:java} { enabled: true, asLocalhost: true }{code} 4) add discovery interest with {code:java} contract.addDiscoveryInterest({ name: 'mychaincode', collectionNames:  'Org1PrivateCollection'  });{code} 5) start fabric network and submit transactions by 30 clients concurrently.  6) kill peer0.org1 manually. then the sdk will report the following errrors. all the transactions will be stopped. {code:java} 2021-01-13T01:45:40.488Z - error:  EventService : unregisterEventListener peer0.org1.example.com  - #1 - event listener was not found 2021-01-13T01:45:40.488Z - error:  EventService : unregisterEventListener peer0.org1.example.com  - #1 - event listener was not found 2021-01-13T01:45:40.488Z - error:  EventService : unregisterEventListener peer0.org1.example.com  - #1 - event listener was not found 2021-01-13T01:45:40.488Z - error:  EventService : unregisterEventListener peer0.org1.example.com  - #1 - event listener was not found 2021-01-13T01:45:40.488Z - error:  EventService : unregisterEventListener peer0.org1.example.com  - #1 - event listener was not found 2021-01-13T01:45:40.489Z - warn:  CommitListenerSession : Error notifying listener: message=eventListener not found, stack=Error: eventListener not found{code}  ></body> </Action>

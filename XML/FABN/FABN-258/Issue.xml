CDATA There is an issue with the fabric-client node sdk. When you compile the project with a typescript compiler. The app dosen't recognize the class names of the objects. For example:  let peer:Peer = new Peer();  console.log(peer.constructor.name) == "" --> So we got an empty string  The problem is the declaration of the class Peer:  {color:#cc7832}var {color}Peer = {color:#cc7832}class {color}{color:#cc7832}extends {color}Remote  need to be changed into:  {color:#cc7832}var {color}Peer = {color:#cc7832}class {color}Peer {color:#cc7832}extends {color}Remote  Otherwise the compiler dosen't understand the syntax and the class name will be empty.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In defaultQueryHandler, the call  {code} const payloads = await this.channel.queryByChaincode(request); {code} passes a txid in the request, but queryByChaincode ignores the txid and creates a new one which will cause confusion when trying to trace via logs the behaviour as the context identifier has now been changed.  There is a JIRA (FABN-985) to address the queryByChaincode, or you can implement your own version of queryByChaincode in the defaultQueryHandler in a similar manner to how hyperledger composer does it.   ></description> </Issue>

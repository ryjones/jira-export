As a result, many applications end up copying the same &quot;util.js&quot; over and over to implement the helpers used to deal with the common scenarios.  Ideally, this may be captured in the SDK itself so that users do not need to replicate it every time." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2017-04-11 14:22:56.0" updated="2019-04-30 16:17:12.0" resolutiondate="2019-04-30 16:17:12.0" votes="1" watches="5" workflowId="33741"/>

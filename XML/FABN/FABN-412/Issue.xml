CDATA In the generated documenation for class Chain, some of the methods do not document their parameters and results.  getOrderers()  Get orderers of a chain.  getTCertBatchSize()  Get the tcert batch size.  isDevMode()  Determine if dev mode is enabled.  isPreFetchMode()  Determine if pre-fetch mode is enabled to prefetch tcerts.  isSecurityEnabled()  Determine if security is enabled.  setPreFetchMode()  Set prefetch mode to true or false.  setTCertBatchSize()  Set the tcert batch size.  Here are some examples of methods that document their inputs and outputs: isReadonly()  Get chain status to see if the underlying channel has been terminated, making it a read-only chain, where information (transactions and states) can be queried but no new transactions can be submitted.  Returns:  Is read-only, true or not.  Type boolean   getInitialAbsoluteMaxBytes()  Get the initial absolute maximum bytes that will be used when this chain is created.  Returns:  initial absolute maximum bytes  Type int   getPeers()  Get peers of a chain from local information.  Returns:  The peer list on the chain.  Type Array.<Peer>    For consistency and usability, all methods should describe their inputs and outputs.    ></description> </Issue>

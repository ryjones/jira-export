CDATA -For the fabric-samples 1.4 branch, docker-compose specifies the version via $IMAGE_TAG, but that version is the latest.( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/first-network/base/peer-base.yaml#L10 )-  -Also, in the case of orderer and couch db in docker-compose, the latest version is used because the version is not clearly displayed.( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/first-network/base/docker-compose-base.yaml#L11 ,  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/first-network/docker-compose-couch.yaml#L14 )-  -I think our should use a clear version, as this can be confusing for people building a network for the first time using ./byfn.sh up.-   --   -If it is no longer supported other than a critical issue, I think we need to provide an environment where users can change versions for future users.-  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi  ~Ratnakar ,  Can you please give some concrete examples you are using to reproduce this failure? I would like to know:  (1) Which version of the fabric you are running to reproduce this. Which branch? Which commit level? (2) Which version of the SDK (which branch) you're reproducing this on. Otherwise, I do know where the fix would go. (3) Example deploy requests with associated errors that cause the failure.  Then reassign back to me please.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  1) & 2)  I think The problem is reproducible on almost all the branches with all versions of hfc 3) Please refer this for more details - https://hyperledgerproject.slack.com/archives/fabric-sdk-node/p1477221876000288 *Reiterating here:* when deploy/invoke request expects an array and passed as string, then NodeSDk ignored to check the same for the correct type and passes the same to Fabric and hence it fails somewhere in Fabric. For example here is an invoke request: {code:javascript} var invokeRequest = { // Name (hash) required for invoke chaincodeID: testChaincodeID, // Function to trigger //fcn: config.invokeRequest.functionName, fcn: "newSecuritySetup", // Parameters for the invoke function args: args1, attrs: "EQTY_licence" }; {code}    here attrs should be an array instead of a string , as a result client program throws the below error  *Error: Error fetching attributes = BAD_REQUEST* this error is thrown from "*RequestAttributes*" function in *acap.go*.  This can be avoided by checking for type of some of the params like args, attrs etc.,      ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~Ratnakar ,  Thank you for clarifying and pointing to the Slack conversation! I appreciate it.  OK, once the deploy/invoke/query transaction path goes into the v1.0 sdk code base (fabric-sdk-node repository), I will make sure that checks for arrays on "args" and "attrs" are added. Right now, the transaction path is still being worked on. I do not think this is a critical issue to be fixed for v0.6, therefore I don't believe it will be allowed to merge to the v0.6 branch as the release is already completed.

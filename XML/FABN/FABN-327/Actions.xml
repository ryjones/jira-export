CDATA I believe this hasn't changed for a while and the problem showing now could be related to changes in levels of node/npm. From the fabric-ca-client point of view there should be no dependency on GPRC but because some of the code (Remote.js, BaseClient.js, api.js etc) is pulled from the fabric-client this problem occurs. Looking at the fabric-ca-client package, the only module which requires Remote.js is api.js, but api.js has no need for Remote. I think there needs to be a slight tidyup of shared code here to fix this (ie api.js) but also relook at what code is copied from fabric-client to fabric-ca-client (for example is Remote.js and BaseClient.js needed ? or should a relook at exactly what is common be split out from these into separate classes).  ></body> </Action>

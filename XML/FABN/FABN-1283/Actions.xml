<Action id="64958" issue="40764" author="heatherp" type="comment" body="Hi  ~Hengming-Zhang  - I am working through the node sdk backlog with the maintainers, we are greatly improving the testing in the master branch but we&apos;re not porting these over to 1.4. We&apos;ve removed the tape unit tests from the master branch, I&apos;ve fixed the way coverage is reporting and we&apos;re in the process of moving to azure pipelines, so it should be easier to run builds and see how they are failing, in comparison to Jenkins. Are these test failures of yours still something you are seeing?" created="2019-10-24 14:44:04.0" updateauthor="heatherp" updated="2019-10-24 14:44:04.0"/>

CDATA Please see issue with elliptic 6.5.2 here:   https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/226      It appears that fabric-common 2.2.0 and fabric-client 1.4.11 both still have elliptic 6.5.2 as a dependency. Various solutions are reporting a high-severity vulnerability with this version of elliptic and it appears the vulnerability has been addressed in version 6.5.3.     I wasn't able to find anything else regarding this issue in relation to Fabric SDK, but is this a known issue and are there any plans to address this? The open vulnerability raises potential issues with using the Node SDK for both 2.x and 1.4.x, as fabric-network appears to have fabric-common or fabric-client dependencies, based on the version used.   ></description> </Issue>

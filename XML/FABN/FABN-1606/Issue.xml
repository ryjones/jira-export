CDATA *As a* maintainer *I want* regular scheduled builds to run *So that* integration issues with Fabric can be identified  Recently the v1.4 branch was broken by the removal of theÂ _latest_ Fabric chaincode images, while Fabric peers were still defaulting to these images. This was only identified when a PR build was run but the problem existed for at least some days before this. Running a regular scheduled build would have identified this issue earlier.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The client obtains its MSP ID only from the *client* section of the connection profile with which it is created. Even if the client has a user context set (with associated MSP ID) and discovery is performed to located all the peers on the network, *getPeersForOrg()* still returns no peers.  A workaround is to call *getPeersForOrg(userContextMspId)*, explicitly specifying the MSP ID of the current user context. This should not be necessary. The client should use the MSP ID of the current user context, or the MSP ID of the organisation specified in the *client* section of the connection profile (as it does currently) if that is not present.  This will allow the client to be used for discovery without requiring the connection profile to contain a *client* section specifying the user's MSP ID.  ></description> </Issue>

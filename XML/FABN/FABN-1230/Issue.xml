CDATA For example when it describes the commit listener, it presents 2 options but doesn't describe the difference between the 2.  Also in the comments of the example code you will see for both options  {code:java} /** * @param {String} transactionId the name of the event listener * @param {Function} callback the callback function with signature (error, transactionId, status, blockNumber) * @param {Object} options **/ {code} For option 1, it has a variable name of transactionId and then describes it as the name for the event listener which is confusing For option 2, transactionId should not be in the comments  ></description> </Issue>

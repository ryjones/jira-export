CDATA Hi Janet, does this issue still exist?  There have been others.  Also, when opening, can we work with the node-sdk to make sure someone is assigned the bug.  Thanks.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Barry, I was having this issue all morning yesterday.  I kept 'git pull' ing fabric because updates were contually merged.  Enentually it stopped happening, and I was able to work.   I'm pretty sure I was removing the keyval store, because I use a shell script to clean up, and another one to start everything in correct sequence.  It's possible startup/takedown sequence has changed since I wrote the scripts and they need updating.  I have to say, though, the scripts seem to work most of the time.   ></body> </Action>

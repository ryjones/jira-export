CDATA The *Channel.getChannelConfigFromOrderer* only returns the *ConfigEnvelope* from block.   {{My suggestion: This }} function should have a optional flag  *{{blockOutput}}*. That will be false as default and if it is true the return of function will be a Block.   {{I really believe that every developer that is using the Fabric SDK Node to make network transactions, such as add a new organization, have the trouble to get the current block configuration. Because today the SDK only provides access to its envelope}}     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As an application developer using fabric-sdk-node, I want the ability to specify chaincode query strategy when I am using the discovery service.  For instance, if the discovery service returns a list a peers and a peer is down at query time, then the application has to wait for a long time until this peer timeout.  If the Channel is initialized with discovery service, the Channel API Channel.queryByChaincode() should accepts a params to specify the query strategy.  some common-used query strategies: # return once get chaincode query response from preferred peers # return once get chaincode query response from any peer # return once get chaincode query response from max block height # return once get chaincode query response from major peers     ></description> </Issue>

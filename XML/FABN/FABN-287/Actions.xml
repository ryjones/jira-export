CDATA Thank you  ~jimthematrix   Locally I'd removed the native version of the hashtable and replaced with hashtable-js - I didn't want to disrupt the code. (I hadn't worked out how to deliver the code yet :))  However your solution looks better if the dependency on a hashtable can be removed.     ></body> </Action>

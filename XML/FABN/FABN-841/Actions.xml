CDATA It will cover but please don't do that... that's an overkill and would spam the peer with requests. Instead - just do it: * Once in a while, say every 5 min or so * Upon update to LSCC which is received from an event  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The once every 5min is already been covered. Update blocks are not that common are they?  And won't the that also cover cases where new organizations are added and thus new peers ?     ~jyellick  ?  ~denyeart  I think I've also added to not discover more than a certain number of times in a period  ></body> </Action>

CDATA {quote}The once every 5min is already been covered.{quote}  I know, I've reviewed the CR :)  {quote} Update blocks are not that common are they?{quote} If by update blocks you mean config blocks then it's something else. I thought you meant on every update of a block. You should re-query upon an update of a config block, but that's not sufficient, as chaincode endorsement changes arrive in non config blocks - Hence the LSCC update we introduced just for SDKs as a result of our kickstart discussion back then (I think it was in Mid April?)  ></body> </Action>

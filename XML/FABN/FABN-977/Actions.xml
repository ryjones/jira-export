CDATA I've resolved the issue by removing the cc6.go file name in the ChainCodePath. However while invoking a method from the chaincode ( shim library PUT_STATE, PUT_PRIVATE DATA), I'm getting below ERROR,     error:  client-utils.js : sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: PUT_STATE failed: transaction ID: 6845b7e887caa2846139e428c5f83273ee2bdeb5f3f83e3ce3b87daf148f2ef5: collection config not define for namespace  cc7 .      Can someone let me know how to pass endorsement-Policy, collection-config details as part of API param ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~KameshPalani  See doc here:    https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.3/tutorial-private-data.html   Note that to work with private data, you'll need to configure gossip anchor peers and configure the channel for ApplicationCapability V1_2.  The first-network sample network is configured for this, but I don't think the balance transfer network is.  Closing the issue since it is not a Fabric bug.  ></body> </Action>

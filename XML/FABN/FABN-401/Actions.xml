CDATA The only way to avoid this is to be sure to connect the ChannelEventHub before the registration of the chaincode event listener or connect with the last block seen number plus one.  Keep in mind that the connect with out any options will get the last block on the ledger, this may contain transactions with the chaincode event being monitored.  Chaincode events listeners that are matching on none specific information and not part of a long running connection ChannelEventHub may fire again and again in an environment with very few transactions.  ></body> </Action>

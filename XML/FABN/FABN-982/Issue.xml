CDATA Currently for chaincode invokes, SDK picks the first peers from the Service Discovery results.  There should be an option for SDK to pick a random set of endorsing peers based on the Service Discovery layouts.  SDK also allows for configuring preferred peers, but also should allow for preferred and required organizations. I think it would be typical to prefer your own org’s peer… so if endorsement policy calls for 2 orgs, you may want to pick your own org plus a random other org.  Therefore the preferred peers configuration should work hand-in-hand with the random option.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="72023" issue="47026" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="The Node SDK doesn&apos;t use RSA signatures so should not be affected by this vulnerability, but it is a pain to have vulnerabilities flagged up and it would definitely be good to get to the latest version of jsrsasign. The issue we have right now is that API changes in v9+ of jsrsasign break the Node SDK, so SDK code needs to be modified to allow migration to current jsrsasign versions." created="2021-08-13 09:12:02.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2021-08-13 09:12:02.0"/>

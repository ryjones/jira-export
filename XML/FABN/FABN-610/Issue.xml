CDATA ProposalResponsePayload has a an 'extension' which is a serialized 'ChaincodeAction'. ChaincodeAction has a 'results' which is a serialized 'TxReadWriteSet'. TxReadWriteSet has N 'rwset' which is a serialized 'KVRWSet'.  SDK needs to provide a utility function that returns the TxReadWriteSet, or better yet, the N KVRWSets and corresponding namespaces (chaincodes), so that client doesn't have to deserialize them.  ></description> </Issue>

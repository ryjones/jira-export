CDATA Clients that have not exported GOPATH should be able to run tests. The client can pass in the relative path to a chaincode, and a base directory, to the node SDK (where it is called "go path"). The base directory does not seem to be used correctly, and the node SDK defaults to always using whatever GOPATH value has been exported in the environment. This enhancement task is to propagate the parameter down and honor it.  Passing the gopath (or) baseDir to package function in fabric-client/lib/Packager.js from fromDirectory function in fabric-client/lib/Package.js. This fromDirectory function will get that path from installChaincode function in Client.js.  ></description> </Issue>

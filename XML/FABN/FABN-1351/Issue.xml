CDATA When chaincode is built, all the logging information relating to the chaincode build is lost when the "building container" is thrown away.  Â   This information is actually quite useful and it would be really neat if it was possible to persist the build log in the chaincode container that is created so that it is possible to verify all build processes.  ></description> </Issue>

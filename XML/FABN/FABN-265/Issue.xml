CDATA Hello,  I've checked the type definitions in the latest Hyperledger Fabric SDK document. It seems that only BlockchainInfo includes currentBlockHash and previousBlockHash which are array<bytes> type.  However, I want them in string type but I do not know where I can get them. Shall I convert them to string by myself and how?  And I got the array<bytes> value of currentBlockHash  which is the same as the value of previousBlockHash in my test. (see the attachment.). That is strange.  I need your help.  Thank you  ></description> </Issue>

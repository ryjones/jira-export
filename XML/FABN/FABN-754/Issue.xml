CDATA the SDK needs to support loading private keys and ecerts that have been provisioned outside of the SDK. the crypto materials should be saved in a "standard" format for sharing and communication purposes.  since the peers have already adopted the "MSP configuration directory" format, which allows for the private keys and signing certificates to be saved, that seems to be a good choice for this.  ></description> </Issue>

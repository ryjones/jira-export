CDATA If working from a Windows client (fabric-client node-sdk), when the Goland.js packager is find all the source code, it doesn't correct the path names.   In node, the FS module will give back platform specific paths.   {{var desc = \{}} {{   name: path.relative(goPath, entry.path),}} {{   fqp: entry.path}} {{};}}     The name and fqp fields need to converted to uni style paths before they are used. The following code in the findSource method would be able to rectify this and I've checked that it does work.    var desc = \{ name: '', fqp: '' };  if (path.sep === '\\')\{ desc.name = path.relative(goPath, entry.path); desc.fwp = entry.path; } else \{ desc.name = path.relative(goPath, entry.path); desc.fwp = entry.path; }  ></description> </Issue>

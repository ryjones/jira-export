CDATA This adds capabilities to register transaction listeners in the Chain class and designate Peer instances as event source. it manages an internal event hub instance and does not require the application code to deal with the EventHub class directly.  This is the API as designed in the SDK design spec, as the "simple API for the simple use cases".  To support more advanced configurations, like using multiple event hub instances for sharing the load on listening to different events, we will expose returning EventHub instances via a call in Chain class. this will be done in a separate task  ></description> </Issue>

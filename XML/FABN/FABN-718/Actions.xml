CDATA This item is not in progress.  Yes there is a new channel-based event service in 1.1 alpha, some highlights:    - uses the same port address as the other services on the Peer    - allows for filtered blocks that do not contain sensitive data so that all users will be able to get events   - allows for specifying start block / end block , one could resume or replay getting events at any point   - The read/write sets of the transaction are included in the blocks returned when receiving the blocks after registering for block events. (however to receive full blocks the user must have read access to the blocks of the channel, which will likely be controlled in a production system)  ></body> </Action>

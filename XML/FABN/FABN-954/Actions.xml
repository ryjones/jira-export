<Action id="51890" issue="34427" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="I suspect this is caused by  FABN-955|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-955 . I am worried by the way this code is directly accessing internal event handling implementation of the new Network.submitTransaction() API and using this for calls made through the low-level API. Its almost certainly going to change and break you. If this is a client use case that we want to support, perhaps we need a story to expose some of the event handling helper capability." created="2018-10-09 09:56:45.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2018-10-09 09:56:45.0"/>

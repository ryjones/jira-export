CDATA The SDK assumes by default that peers and orderers returned by service discovery will be running with TLS (grpcs://):  Client._buildUrl {code} sdk_utils.getConfigSetting('discovery-protocol', 'grpcs'); {code}  This is a bad assumption when we are connecting to a gateway peer that is not running with TLS (grpc://).   If we get discovery results from a peer without TLS, we should assume the peers and orderers returned by service discovery are also running without TLS.  ></description> </Issue>

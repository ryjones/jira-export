CDATA When I'm trying listening events on blockchain I get disconnected after some time and I don't get any error on the client side (ChannelEventhub) either on the server side (peer). If the peer is then trying to send an event to channel event hub finds that stream was canceled and close the stream with error:  {quote}error="context finished before block retrieved: context canceled" grpc.code=Unknown{quote}  This is happening when grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data is set to 0. When I set  grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data to 1000 for example then ChannelEventHub is working but I need to restart it every day.  ></description> </Issue>

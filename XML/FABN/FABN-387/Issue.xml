CDATA CryptoSuite does not need to include a store when used by Chain.js, so the store should be removed from CryptoSuite and when needed, the application will create a new CryptoKeyStore and set it on the CryptoSuite.  If you want to use the default key store, the app does not need to anything.  To use a special key store, the app will need to create a new CryptoKeyStore using the desired options, set it on the cryptoSuite and include it on the User and Fabric CA Client.  For example: {code:java} cryptoSuite = client.newCryptoSuite(setting); cryptoSuite.setCryptoKeyStore(client.newCryptoKeyStore(KVSImplClass, opts));{code} Set cryptoSuite on the user: {code:java} user.setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite);{code}    Include cryptoSuite parameter on a new FabricCAServices: {code:java} return new FabricCAServices(fabricCAEndpoint, tlsOptions, userOrg.ca.name, cryptoSuite);{code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~zhaochy  This issue isn't about calling FabricUtils.getLogger outside the SDK. It's about the lack of debug logging even thought I called: {code:java} FabricClient.setConfigSetting('hfc-logging', {'debug':'console'});{code}  The following bit of code has the same effect as the one above.       {code:java} const FabricClient = require('fabric-client'); FabricClient.setConfigSetting('hfc-logging', {'debug':'console'}); {code}  All the same methods are callled. As I said:    {noformat} Inside `fabric-client/lib/Client.js` a logger is set with `var logger = sdkUtils.getLogger('Client.js');`.{noformat} I added the call to: {code:java} FabricUtils.getLogger(){code} So you could see that calling: {code:java} logger.debug("Some message"){code} did nothing.  So this issue is not fixed. I'll update my initial issue report to reflect the above.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA An easy way to set the logging before doing the require is to use an environment setting before or when calling calling node or setting the environment from code.      process.env.HFC_LOGGING = "\{'debug': 'console'}";  ></body> </Action>

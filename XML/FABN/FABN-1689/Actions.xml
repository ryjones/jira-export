CDATA  ~lquintai   SDK supported direction is abstracting away as much as possible from low-level infrastructure concerns.  The expectation is that client applications should not have to worry about individual peers - that’s an operational concern.  This direction is further emphasized in the new separate fabric-gateway component which is under development.  To qualify this feature addition a strong use-case would be required.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="71316" issue="46477" author="lquintai" type="comment" body="The only user case I have is the extension, where we allow the user to select the peers they&apos;re interested in. This is a niche scenario, so not the strong use case required to go ahead with the implementation. It seems this is as designed and not a bug then, and we are actively preventing the user from doing it for a reason." created="2021-01-27 14:49:35.0" updateauthor="lquintai" updated="2021-01-27 14:49:35.0"/>

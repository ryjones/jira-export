CDATA Currently there is no query handler option to evaluate transactions on user selected peers. This is possible on submit transaction.     This is a very basic behaviour, and the comments on the code seem to indicate it's implemented when in fact it is not, so it would be great to have it out of the box rather than the user having to implement it.     Comment I'm referring to in fabric-network: {code:java} /**    * Evaluate a transaction function and return its results.    * The transaction function will be evaluated on the endorsing peers but    * the responses will not be sent to the ordering service and hence will    * not be committed to the ledger.    * This is used for querying the world state.    * @async    * @param {...string}  args  Transaction function arguments.    * @returns {Promise<Buffer>} Payload response from the transaction function.    */ async evaluate(...args) { ... } {code}    This should happen without a gateway disconnect, ie, the user should be decide which peers to evaluate the transaction on while already connected to the gateway.  ></description> </Issue>

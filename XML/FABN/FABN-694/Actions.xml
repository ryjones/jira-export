CDATA There was a Slack conversation on this, but I just realized that we might really be overthinking this one.  All we really need is for the fabric dependencies to be in the container.  There are a couple options here:  1) We actually create a new base Golang CC image 2) Modify the Dockerfile generated by the SDK to do {{go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric}}   I actually prefer option 1 because then each version of the fabric would have its own proper image until we figure out versioning of the fabric dependencies  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hey  ~MariWade , I've been going through the node sdk backlog with the maintainers. I've just installed fabric-client at 1.4.5-snapshot.69 and in it's package.json I can see a dependency of fabric-ca-client at version "unstable-1.4. Whilst that doesn't sound great, it's not the same as "latest" - does this match what you see? Â   ></body> </Action>

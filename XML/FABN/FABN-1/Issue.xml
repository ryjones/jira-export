CDATA  ~vdods  wrote in Rocket.Chat: I strongly suggest changing the stateful implementation of Client (and probably others, such as Chain), as it obscures the responsibility of each class and makes the relationships between the concepts more difficult to understand. For example, the Client.installChaincode method presumably acts on behalf of a user, but it's not clear if it does, and the documentation doesn't indicate anything about which user it should be, or that setUserContext should be used. Same for many other functions. Concretely, remove the notion of user context and require the app to pass in the desired User object directly to the relevant methods. It will make for an easier to understand an use SDK and much clearer app code.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA node fabric-network (1.4.8), is inherently dependent on fabric-ca-client (latest, and not fixed), and fabric-client(also latest).  now while node fabric-client (latest) is still 1.4.10, fabric-ca-client (latest) has recently changed from 1.4.10 to 2.2.0. this also introduces dependency on fabric-common (2.2.0).  *in current state fabric-network(1.4.x) is depending on fabric-ca-client(2.2.x).*  the above change causes different User type dependencies being referred to in fabric-network (1.4.8). from fabric-common and fabric-client, with User being referred to by fabric-ca-client (2.2.0), and fabric-client (1.4.10), for below invocation:   const ca = this.adminGateway.getClient().getCertificateAuthority(); await *ca.register*(  {       affiliation: '',       enrollmentID: enrollmentID,       role: 'client',     }  , *this.adminGateway.getCurrentIdentity*());  Same issue could be there for other node versions of fabric-network as well, because of depending on latest version of fabric-client and fabric-ca-client.  Kindly suggest.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="59596" issue="39193" author="florianc" type="comment" body="Random dev here: I completely agree. I am currently stuck because the addContractListener doc says I am able to specify a startBlock/endBlock in options. Tried, does not work (with startBlock). Same for &quot;filtered&quot;, if I had not seen it on stackoverflow and in another Jira issue, I would not have known fast how &quot;unfilter&quot; events. To be honest, the outdated (or missing) documentation is a very (very) big problem from my dev point of view." created="2019-04-30 12:59:46.0" updateauthor="florianc" updated="2019-04-30 12:59:46.0"/>

CDATA This feature should belong to the CLI instead of the SDK. it's unlikely that for production anybody would want the application to grab the chaincode source from the local file system because then making updates to the chaincode would require re-deploying the app. I think it's more likely that the app gets the source from a remote storage (code repo, database, etc.)  But this is definitely a handy tool as part of the CLI during development and test. So changed the title from "... from SDK" to "... from CLI".   ~markparz  if you have concerns with the above assumption, please let us know. thanks.  ></body> </Action>

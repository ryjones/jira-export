CDATA fabric-sdk-node CI jobs was renamed after the pipeline changes merged. The job names are not pointing fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64 and fabric-sdk-node-merge-x86_64.. But the Build Status badge on README is still pointing to "fabric-sdk-node8-merge-master-x86_64" which was renamed recently after pipeline changes.  Remove the badge details from all the branches  This change has to apply on the all the branches.  ></description> </Issue>

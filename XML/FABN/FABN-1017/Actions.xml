CDATA I would like to reopen this JIRA ticket for new issues on same topic: node-sdk build badge.   Quoted from Mark Lewis:  How about adding build status badges for all the current release branches (release-1.4, release-2.2, master) to either the README.md or some status page in the master branch? It would be really useful to have them all easily visible in one place.  We could have also have build status badges for individual branches in their respective README but this seems less useful as people typically only see the master branch README when visiting the GitHub pages.  The other consideration is that the useful build status is the last Scheduled or Individual CI builds so we can monitor whether things like changes in other Fabric components have broken the SDK. It is not useful to flag up failures in PR builds.  ></body> </Action>

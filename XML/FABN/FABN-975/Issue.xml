CDATA At present the test effort for fabric-sdk-node is located within: - unit tests (mocha, at package level) - unit tests (legacy tape tests) - e2e functional tests (tape)  There is no high level "user-centric" testing completed that can ensure the continued operation of core user scenarios. Such tests represent the "top of the test pyramid" flexing a large amount of code via large scale actions.  Cucumber.js represents the most elegant and appropriate solution for this missing test section and should be added as a complimentary test framework to the existing unit and fv tests.  ></description> </Issue>

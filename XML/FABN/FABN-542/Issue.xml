CDATA this is based on the two review comments in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12577/, on the design of the method setUserFromConfig(name, password, clear_existing_user):  # is there ever a reason why the current user context should not be cleared? # now I'm looking at how this is used, I feel this method should really be part of "setUserContext()". so setUserContext() should be enhanced to check if the first argument is a User object (User.isInstance()) or not. if an user, then assume it's been enrolled (the current behavior). if an object with "username" and "enrollmentSecret" properties, assume it's possibly an un-enrolled user and process it the way you are currently doing.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA in order to have an end-to-end test suite that: - creates a channel - joins peers to the new channel - install chaincode to the peers - instantiate chaincode on the new channel - invoke transactions - query  there must be a coherent set of crypto materials that: - starts the fabric-ca with the right key and cert so the ecerts it signs can be properly validated by the peers and orderers - starts the orderer with the orderer's org msp config - starts the peers in each organization with the org's msp config  This task is for tracking the work to create a set of coherent crypto materials (like those produced by the bdd test's "bootstrap.feature"), and docker-compose.yaml that starts each component with the right config.  ></description> </Issue>

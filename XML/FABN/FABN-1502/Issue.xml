CDATA I broke fabric-ca-client@1.4.6, and this broke everyone else using any of our packages published out of fabric-sdk-node, because they depend on the "latest" version of fabric-client. This made me sad.   Notes from conversations with Mark: The dependency of fabric-client on latest fabric-ca-client seems sub-optimal too. A broken latest fabric-ca-client breaks all versions of fabric-client. I thought the publish re-wrote the dependencies so fabric-client depended on the same version of fabric-ca-client. Maybe that is only in master. Or maybe it’s just not working  .  I think the rewriting is supposed to happen in scripts/ci_scripts/azurePublishNpmPackages.sh    At a quick glance, it looks like it’s setting the dependency versions based on the "tag" property in the package.json. Maybe it should really be using the value of the "version" tag?  We think this is something we used to do in Jenkins land, so we need to decide how we want this to work, and fix it. Primarily for 1.4.x, but relevant for the 2.0.0 branch too.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This was opened as a result of my review of https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16673. I noticed the following code in which a constructor called "newTransactionID"  returns an object which has a method "getTransactionID" to get the actual string ID. This is weird.  {code} let tx_object = client.newTransactionID();  // get the transaction ID string for later use let tx_id = tx_object.getTransactionID(); {code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I thought it might not be the design idea of nodejs-sdk  It is just a nodejs sdk, which normally run for API, server application.  In architecture point of view, client side software should not directly manipulate some crypto material, as you can see which appear as plain-text in node-sdk.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~davidkhala . With secure storage available in Android and ios, I was curious if a wallet approach like metamask is on the feature roadmap of Hyperledger. This way key management and signing can occur on the client side.   Otherwise the current option seems to be to go with a server side HSM module being made available to all clients to connect and manage crypto material and signing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~siddesh_sangodkar  Yes, I agree on that.  Hoping there will be a fabric-android, fabric-objectC to do that. I knew some developers has done some trial and success in their scenario. But they are usually domain-specific solution.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The fabric-node-sdk is just that ... and SDK to work within the context of Node.js  It's fair to ask for a pure JavaScript client ... although there are issues as you indicated in the description  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A link to https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web but it describes as requiring a special proxy, so the node-sdk would have to either have 2 distinct versions or somehow have it be able to work with either based on some sort of configuration setting. As for file system access that is related to credential storage and would remain however it is possible to provide different key value stores that can store information in other locations such as remote servers or browser local storage   ></body> </Action>

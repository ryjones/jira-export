CDATA The current SDK node readme needs to be reworked.  Currently the readme is somewhat confusing and difficult to follow. In particular: - We have more packages than are declared here - It is written from the perspective of someone who has the entire Hyperledger family under their GoPath ... this is not the case for a node developer, they will simply clone the repo and expect to get going - Why should someone need to build their own images when they can pull them directly from nexus (this should be a provided script ... invoked by a npm task command) - Not all the dependancies are versioned ... we should be explicit, for instance there is a breaking change from gulp version 3.9 to 4...and we rely on 3.9 - Why don't we provide a copy/paste snippet for each "you need to install this" item? - How about a pre-reqs script perhaps? One that installs everything you need on a vanilla machine? - Seems we are giving some love to windows developers, so they will probably want a "gulp install-generate-certs-windows" option - We should be more explicit in detailing how to configure/run the tests, and we should not tell people how many tests there are... that's pointless and a maintenance nightmare - The section titles "Hyperledger Fabric Client objects" ... what even is that there for?! The overview of packages is at the top, and each package has its own readme. - What works with what? Version for fabric-x would be handy   ></description> </Issue>

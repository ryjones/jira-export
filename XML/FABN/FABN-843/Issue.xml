CDATA The discovery service query can receive names of collections of a chaincode namespace so that the returned endorsement descriptor would filter out peers not in the collection.    {code:java} message ChaincodeCall {      string name = 1; repeated string collection_names = 2; } {code}    This has 2 advantages: * Confidentiality - sometimes private data is populated with transient field, and thus we can't send the data to peers not in the collection, because they would receive the data we want to keep private. * A peer that endorses, might not have the private data, and as a result - the endorsement would fail....     Thus, the SDK needs to provide a means to a user to specify collection names which he/she predicts would be used in the chaincode invocation, and these names would be passed to the discovery service by the SDK.        ></description> </Issue>

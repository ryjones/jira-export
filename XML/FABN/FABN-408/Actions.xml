CDATA  ~nnao  Any update for the JIRA ?   There is code that might help you with this. E.g, events/producer/producer_test.go. Also examples/events/block-listener/block-listener.go does not directly send the event but might get you to do what you want.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~muralisr  Thank you for information. I had made the patch and is testing it now. In events/producer dir test, there is some problem after patching. I can pass the test by each function using "go test -run XXX". But I can't pass the test using "go test". Now I'm trying to solve.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~nnao  After looking at your CR, realized a better fix might be to remove REGISTER altogether. It might be a left over from the original idea to use that for registration. The key to note is that, rest of the enums such as BLOCK are used in the handler chat _after_ registration (so registration is a special case that has to happen first before chat can be handled and hence is not handled with a REGISTER event).   ~pmullaney  what do you think ?  If everyone agrees with removing REGISTER, better to do this post 1.0 so we don't touch protos now.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rickr     I post a patch that deletes REGISTER event. Then I got some error in jenkins of end-2-end test. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-end-2-end-x86_64/7557/console  fabric-sdk-jave uses REGISTER event to avoid correct failure(FAB-5577) https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/EventHub.java#L208  I think REGISTER event defined in source code but it can't use now. what do I need to do to solve this issue? I will make a patch that deletes related REGISTER event at fabric-sdk-java? or If the REGISTER event is needed, I will make a patch to use REGISTER events?  ></body> </Action>

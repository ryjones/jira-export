There is a gulp task `ca` which needs to be run first before working with the node-sdk source. This prepares the fabric-ca-client source appropriately for use." created="2018-07-31 07:15:48.0" updateauthor="davidkel" updated="2018-07-31 07:15:48.0"/>

I think I didn&apos;t run the `gulp ca` task before running the SDK and hence the error. " created="2018-07-31 13:43:30.0" updateauthor="akarshagrawal792" updated="2018-07-31 13:43:30.0"/>

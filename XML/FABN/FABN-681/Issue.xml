CDATA As titled, gradually switch to use const/let instead of var since node8 is supported and tested only. # use existing eslint rules to regular syntax # change eslint config in build/tasks/eslint, add "prefer-const", “no-var” # use const/let instead of var as much as possible # use string literal syntax instead of widely used util.format and string concat # instead of create point to this as 'self', use arrow function to avoid this confusion  ></description> </Issue>

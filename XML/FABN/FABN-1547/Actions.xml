CDATA Lots of copyright comments at the beginning of source files begin with */*** instead of */** and so are being treated as JSDoc.  Some internal (non-exported) constants look to have JSDoc comments without a *@private* tag and so are incorrectly included in the docs as global members.  Other cases are where the JSDoc for functions does not correctly define the scope and so they are incorrectly included as global functions.  Really, since this single set of docs covers multiple modules, every piece of JSDoc should use *@memberof* to define which of the modules it belongs to, as we do throughout the JSDoc for _fabric-network_.  ></body> </Action>

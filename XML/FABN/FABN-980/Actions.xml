<Action id="63547" issue="34820" author="davidkel" type="comment" body="This suggestion was to detect where there was a possible state fork between peers. A commit event from the peer can come back as valid or invalid and invalid for a number of reasons. What if, when listening for commit events from these peers for the same transaction, they don&apos;t agree ? ie 1 peer says the tx is valid, 1 peer says the tx is not valid. What if all peers say the tx is not valid but the reasons they give differ ? In the past there has been the implied assumption that the peers will always agree when they validate and commit a block, but this has been proven to not be the case in practice and a fork in either the blockchain or state has occurred." created="2019-09-04 12:57:03.0" updateauthor="davidkel" updated="2019-09-04 12:57:03.0"/>

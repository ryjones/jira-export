CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  Also just to make sure I would like to mention this point.  couldn't make the Admin operations (Channel creation/join/install/instantiate etc.,) work, if we just git rid off the *_tls_mutual* object.  Also you can't  reproduce this issue on Local networks but with the networks having proxies.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~eymorale  I knew someone got this issue before. Almost  the same issue. I don't think it is a bug or defects of node sdk. When using the loadFromConfig(), you have to populate the channel object with info from profile file. This function just load the config, but it is your duty to populate the proper object.  ex, populating the specific channel with channel peer. As I know this is a fix. This may be  the miss. Please try that.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The code added for discovery to generate a self signed cert is adding a client key and cert to the 'Client' object. Then when a new peer or orderer NodeSDK object is created, the client key and cert are used for the GRPC mutual TLS parameters. When talking directly to a Peer or Orderer, these do not cause a problem with a Peer or Orderer that is not using mutual TLS, however it does seem to cause an issue with a proxy sitting in front of the fabric network.   ~mastersingh24  should we not be setting up GRPC to use mutual TLS on the client side (NodeSDK) and just generate the certificate for use with Discovery when we do not have one and only setup the GRPC mutual TLS client settings if the user directs ( when the user setting the key/cert ).  ></body> </Action>

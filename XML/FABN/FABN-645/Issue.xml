CDATA When using the node SDK to install chaincode onto a Peer using a chaincodePackage I incorrectly interpreted the description of the chaincodePath field to be the path to the chaincode file rather than the directory the file was in. The problem is that the install appears to succeed and the chaincode can be queried but doing the follow on instantiate fails because it can't find the chaincode.  I would suggest fixing this in one of two ways. # If the chaincodePath specifies a file, use the directory it is in as the chaincodePath field. # *OR* If the chaincodePath specifies a file, fail the install and change part of the description of 'chaincodePath' from "The path to the location of the source code of the chaincode" to be "The path to the directory containing the chaincode source file(s)"        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently SDK takes hex string of signature for creating channel. But it is inconsistent in the following two places...  * SDK needs proto for getting signatures  * SDK needs proto for configupdate for create channel  Since we need to store the config update, we should support taking encoded objects (in hex or base64) to be consistent.  ></description> </Issue>

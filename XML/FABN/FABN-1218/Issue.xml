CDATA I see  fabric-shim-crypto|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/tree/master/fabric-shim-crypto  library for performing encryption & signing in chaincode. This suggests to pass key through transient data.  I think about another approach in which we can add it as an custom attribute in the certificate during certicate generation. This way whenever user interact with the chaincode, key can be retrieved by accessing the certificate and perfrom related crypto operation.  Please provide the views regarding the security & implementation  point of view.  (This is here to know the views of devs, not sure if it belongs here)  ></description> </Issue>

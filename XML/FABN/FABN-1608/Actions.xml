<Action id="69766" issue="45675" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="I suspect what has happened is that one endorsement plan group has an insufficient number of peers but the endorsement handling has gone on to gain successful endorsement using a different endorsement plan group. I&apos;m not sure whether the problem here is that there is a genuine error in the endorsement plan groups returned by discovery, or whether this is an accepted situation (perhaps specific to where you have specified target orgs) and the log should simply not be at error level." created="2020-07-23 09:02:04.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-07-23 09:02:04.0"/>

CDATA I could not confirm an actual failure in endorsement, in spite of above error seen on node client     fwiw: replacing discovery to use the policy on the collections, instead of explicit _setEndorsingOrganizations()_ circumvented above error statement.     Now switched to using this:   {code:java} contract.addDiscoveryInterest({ name: myChaincodeName, collectionNames:  memberAssetCollectionName, org1PrivateCollectionName  });{code}  ></body> </Action>

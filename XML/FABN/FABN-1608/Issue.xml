CDATA Reported on RocketChat by  ~sijo.c  (fabric-sdk-node 22 Jul 20):  Seeing this log in 2.2 node client (not on every run, but every other run or so) but the txn seem to go through fine. {noformat} 2020-07-22T21:19:53.701Z - error:  DiscoveryHandler : Error: Endorsement plan group does not contain enough peers (0) to satisfy policy (required:1) {noformat}  Note: Using setEndorsingOrganizations(mspOrg1) in txn. Policy used "OR('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')" in fabric-samples/asset-transfer-private-data chaincode  From the chaincode logs it seem to have worked in committing to ledger, and subsequent reads are seeing the data written from above call.

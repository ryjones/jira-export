CDATA Currently when defining the peers of a channel, the peer also includes the roles that peer has on the channel. These roles are no longer being used by the low level and have not been used by the high level. Removing the roles will allow the peers to be defined as an array of peer names the same way that the orderers are defined on the channel. We will continue to support the previous peer definitions as attribute names, the roles will be ignored.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

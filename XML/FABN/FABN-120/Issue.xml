CDATA Its confusing to end users what is a valid test and often these are the only examples end users use. Ideally, the requirements of running the tests should be captured in a test harness (fabric setup) that drives the tests. If that existed, it would be easy to determine which tests were currently enabled and should be considered valid. Numerous error messages that are not errors need to be surpressed to avoid useless investigation(See attachment).    ></description> </Issue>

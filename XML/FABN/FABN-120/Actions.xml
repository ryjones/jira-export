<Action id="22598" issue="15695" author="pmullaney" type="comment" body="I might just not be aware of an existing mechanism but I&apos;d like to see something like the v0.6 script that automated the fabric setup prior to then running the tests. I think &quot;gulp test&quot; current captures an ordering of a subset of the tests such that they pass. I think the readme is confusing in this area as it doesn&apos;t mention that and then suggests that tests can be run individually." created="2017-04-17 17:35:25.0" updateauthor="pmullaney" updated="2017-04-17 17:35:25.0"/>

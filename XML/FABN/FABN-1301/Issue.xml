CDATA When running the npm command “npm run retrieve-images”, the command fails to get Fabric images from Nexus. The npm command calls a shell script written in /bin/sh. This shell sets the “-o pipefail” option. However, this option does not exist in the POSIX sh. We need to fix the script to use Bash to make the option available.  ></description> </Issue>

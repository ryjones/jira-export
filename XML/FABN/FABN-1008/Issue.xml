CDATA In both release-1.2 and release-1.3 branches, the npm modules current release version still pointing to latest and latest-1.2.

With that, change the version and tag to unstable-1.3 and unstable-1.2  and appropriate versions.Â    https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.3/fabric-ca-client/package.json#L4   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.2/fabric-client/package.json   ></description> </Issue>

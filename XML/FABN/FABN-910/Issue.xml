CDATA eventhub connections are requested asynchronously on the first submitTransaction, the implementation should be moved to a connect up front model to avoid any timing issues that could occur.  When a gateway is disconnected, the event hubs are not disconnected which means that if multiple gateways are connected/disconnected, these eventhub connections will build up using network resources.  ></description> </Issue>

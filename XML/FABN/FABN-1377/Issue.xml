CDATA FABN-1375 added support for packaging a child directory containing a go chaincode module but, given the patterns in the code, only supported chaincode implementations that were at the root of the module.  Proper packaging would, when given a path to a directory, would  1. determine if the directory is part of a go module 2. package the code relative to the root of the go module 3. determine the import path of the package within the module relative to the root and use that as the "path" in the chaincode metadata  Alternatively, the SDK should get out of the business of packaging apps. The code does understand go. The implementation: - does not gather dependencies - does not understand the difference between a package import path and a file system path - does not understand module vs gopath  /cc  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~denyeart   ></description> </Issue>

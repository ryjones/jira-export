CDATA From the generated documentation here: file:///C:/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node/doc  I've copied the page for class Chain into an odt file and annotated it with document suggestions.    General principles of API documentation:   Documentation for each API should answer these questions: - Result:  What's the result of issuing this API - Requirements:  What's required to issue this API ?  - Restrictions:  List any restrictions - Tips:  If you can ignore what the tip says, it's a valid tip.  Otherwise, it must be a result, requirement, or restriction.   Some documentation actually has headings:  Results, Requirements, Restrictions (and optionally) Tips.   I will attach the odt document.  It is based on hfc 0.0.2 (just before moving from github to Gerrit).     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA fabric commit 303ee1f336df0cd78ded29241635120a71555a9c  fabric-sdk-node commit 9fe8114c46f8dcb7c3ff0348a4fca7fc16294ea5  ></environment> <description><! CDATA The current fabric-sdk-node uses grpc 1.2.4 (the latest version before 1.3.0), which is old and has several potential bugs. One example of such bugs is https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/11015, which may crash long-running applications.  It seems that the connection issue reported in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5464 is also fixed in the latest version.  Moreover, the compatibility issue in v1.3.0 addressed by https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3491 and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3492 is fixed in v1.3.1 (see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/releases/tag/v1.3.1 ), and 'gulp test' works well with the latest version of grpc.  It seems that there is no showstopper to update grpc node module to the latest one (v1.4.1).   ></description> </Issue>

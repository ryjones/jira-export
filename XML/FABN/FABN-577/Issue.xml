CDATA Proposal responses contain a payload but these are opaque to the client. If the client wanted to look at the content of the payload a client would have to work out how to decode the various protobufs that make up the payload.  I'm unsure of the content of the payload so not sure how a client could make use of a decoded payload. I was originally looking to perhaps being able to determine at least the identifier of the endorser for each of the returned payloads from a proposal, but there could be far more useful data in there that the client may wish to inspect.  ></description> </Issue>

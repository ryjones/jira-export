CDATA As mentioned in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/455, we need to be able to use the *bytes codec* in the *Stanford Javascript Crypto Library (SJCL)* and so have it available for the node/sdk "out of the box".  While it is  "known"|https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/issues/97  that SJCL has to be (pre-)configured with such codec, before calling 'make'... we have two options:  +Option1: Local/manual configuration/build+ The way we tested was to {{git clone}} the *sjcl* library into {{fabric/sdk/node/node_modules}} and manually, from {{fabric/sdk/node/node_modules}} execute:  0. {{cd fabric/sdk/node/node_modules}} (Duh! ;-)) 1. {{rm -rf sjcl}} & {{git clone https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl.git}} 2. {{cd sjcl}} 3. {{./configure --with-codecBytes}} or {{./configure --with-all}} 4. {{make}}  Then all the sdk/node tests pass (with the latest 'master', e.g., changes from commit-level c45a381782ce58368a9ee858a097896c901270c6)  +Option 2: (the preferable, "npm-standard" solution)+ Instead, what we should probably do is to have a pre-configured sjcl version (of 1.0.3 at the moment) which has been configured as above. There are a few such npm packages, and  sjcl-codec-bytes|https://github.com/zaach/sjcl-codec-bytes  is one,  sjcl-codec|https://www.npmjs.com/package/sjcl-codec  and  sjcl-all|https://www.npmjs.com/package/sjcl-all  are also there, etc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA this file is getting very big with thousands of lines of code. it becomes increasingly difficult to code and debug with it.  should instead break it apart into separate "test suites" and group them together in a single folder dedicated to headless tests (those that don't require a target network to run)  it seems tape does not support test suite hierarchy (istanbul will not be able to find coverage information if a test module is required from another module). so the intended solution is to use a "gulp" task to launch it  ></description> </Issue>

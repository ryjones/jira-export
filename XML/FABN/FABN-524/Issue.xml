CDATA Generated documentation for chain.setInitialAbsoluteMaxBytes says this:  setInitialAbsoluteMaxBytes(initial)  Set the initial absolute maximum bytes that will be used when this chain is created. *Default 0 *    Saying the default is zero is confusing.  You must specify a non negative integer value when calling the method, so the parameter has no default value.  When the chain is first created, the field seems to be set to 0xA00000.  So initialAbsoluteMaxBytes  has a default value, but it's not zero.    The same is probably true of other methods documented in this class, but I didn't write the test cases for these methods.  I'll update if I find more such methods in my testing.   How to recreate: 1.Clone fabric-sdk-node 2.cd fabric-sdk-node 3.gulp doc 4.Start HTTP server 5.Use browser to inspect documentation for class Chain.     ></description> </Issue>

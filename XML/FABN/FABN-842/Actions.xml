CDATA This is the flow that I am planning to implement for 1.3 use of discovery * USER provided a single peer * USER initializes a channel object ** NodeSDK discovers peers and chaincodes ** NodeSDK discovers and caches endorsement plans for each chaincode * USER makes endorsement call ** USER includes only proposal chaincode name parameter ** <new for 1.3> USER includes new parameter to indicate chaincodes and collections for the proposal ** NodeSDK checks discovery cache based on call parameters and age and if not found or aged out ** NodeSDK will do a new discovery query with all new and known chaincodes and collections to refresh the cache <query and cache updated for 1.3 to include chaincode to chaincode and collections>         Note: this does assume that the discovery results are returned in the same order as the request  ** NodeSDK will send endorsements based on the latest endorsement plan <updated for 1.3 to allow for using chaincode to chaincode and collection based plans>.  ></body> </Action>

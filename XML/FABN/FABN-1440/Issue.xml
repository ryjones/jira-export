CDATA Since I removed gulp, the jsdoc command that builds the docs is no longer making use of docstrap, which results in the theme of the docs being different between the 1.4 branch and master branch.   1.4 currently:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/  master currently: https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/  So gulp was using docstrap under the covers somewhere, so depending on what theme we prefer, we should probably re-enable using docstrap    Gulp PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/pull/61  ></description> </Issue>

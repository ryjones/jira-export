CDATA README.md at this url: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node  Has these instructions which aren't clear:  run vagrant up to launch the vagrant VM Once inside vagrant, cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric run make images to build the docker images copy docker-compose.yml file in home directory (/home/vagrant) and copy the following content into the file   1.Need to add  'vagrant ssh' between the 'run vagrant up' instruction and the 'Once inside vagrant' instruction.    2.This instruction is unclear:  docker-compose.yml file in home directory (/home/vagrant) and copy the following content into the file  I discussed this instruction with JIm.  I suggest  breaking this into two steps: a.Create a file in /home/vagrant called docker-compose.yml. c.Copy the contents of the file here: <link to docker-compose.yml> into /home/vagrant/docker-compose.yml    ></description> </Issue>

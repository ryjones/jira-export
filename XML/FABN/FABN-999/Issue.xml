CDATA This relates to the output of a conversation with  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  and  ~andrew-coleman  regarding the ability to target a specific chaincode version during install/instantiate.  Example: - At the moment when an install/instantiate is performed it is (assumed) not possible to control the version of chaincode that is used. For instance, if deploying java chaincode there is no (currently known) way to specify the version of the javaenv that is used; in the 1.4.0 builds, the 1.4.0 javaenv is pulled and used. - It would be desirable to be able to directly specify this level as an optional parameter (maybe metadata?) during the install, that is respected at the point of instantiation - This would give users greater control over the chaincode lifecycle   ></description> </Issue>

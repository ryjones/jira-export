CDATA A new theme ‘programming model enhancements’ aims to introduce a set of higher level abstractions to the Fabric SDKs and chaincode interface.  The aim of this is to simplify the development experience and reduce the amount of boilerplate code that the developer has to write for many of the common use-cases when creating applications that access a Fabric network.  Much of this is driven by feedback from users and from experience with the Hyperledger Composer project which adds business level abstractions on top of the existing Fabric APIs.  Initially, these enhancements will be delivered to the Node.js versions of the SDK and chaincode.  This epic adds the ability to submit a transaction to the ledger using a single submit method that takes care of the usual multi-step process under the covers (submit proposal to all endorsing peers, collect and group responses, send responses to ordering service, await commit notification). It also adds the ability for transaction functions to return values to the client application (fabric supports this).    This new function is exposed through a new package (fabric-network) which contains classes that represent the network and the contract with classes supporting identity management (wallets).  Functional delivery will include associated unit and e2e tests to support the feature.

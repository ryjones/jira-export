CDATA I agree there are lots of problems with only getting error messages which may have to be parsed. Unfortunately we don't have control over all of them, for example the UNKNOWN 14: comes from grpc.  We should have a better error reporting mechanism, but this is an enhancement as opposed to a bug. So changing this to a Story which can be looked at as part of improving the node-sdk API  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The worry is that at any point those error strings can be updated.   There are automated unit tests but due to all the mocks, those will not catch any update error string a real Fabric network/sdk would throw.  The only way to catch is to do a manual test against a real system and validate the error string on any update    ></body> </Action>
<Action id="50086" issue="31008" author="davidkel" type="comment" body="Absolutely agree, but it isn&apos;t a bug and some of the error messages we just cannot control (ie those that come from dependent libraries) so how to deal with those. It&apos;s going to be either an enhancement or breaking change to the api to do the right thing and do it everywhere so not a small feat." created="2018-09-07 14:14:18.0" updateauthor="davidkel" updated="2018-09-07 14:14:18.0"/>

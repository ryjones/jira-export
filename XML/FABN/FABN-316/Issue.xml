CDATA The Node SDK documentation needs to have a complete review to fix any broken or incorrect references, and to re-align with the changes being made to support build-your-first-network and write-your-first-application. Specifically, there are references to Getting Started, which is now just a landing page for a pair of tutorials. The reference should be to building the network.  Further, we need to be sure that there is alignment in the prerequisites. It should be that the SDK docs defer completely to Fabric docs for any prerequisites and add only those that are unique to the Fabric SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

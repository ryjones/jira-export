CDATA Hi  ~Adryx86 , I'm working through the backlog with the maintainers, and we're happy with the design of this, for users to need to specify the label they've created for the identity when connecting to the gateway.  Please re-open if you feel that our documentation could better describe this issue  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~heatherp , thanks for reply. I think calling it identity is confusing.. maybe the problem is the "label" which could be converted to something like "identity alias"..Â  I think this way when a developer found an identity attribute can understand without looking at documentation (or source code) he should use the alias if needed. What do you think about that ? If you agree with me i'll re-open the ticket.  ></body> </Action>

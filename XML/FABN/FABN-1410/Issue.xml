CDATA Here the scenario: * Wallet type: FileSystemWallet * Enroll an identity importing it in the wallet using a label (eg: identity = admin, label = XYZ)  The Gateway.connect requires to specify a GatewayOptions with identity and wallet option. The identity value seems to be 'admin'  and trying it the connect method created a new empty  folder called 'admin' in the wallet path and i got an error like 'admin is not enrolled'.  I went deeper in the source code i found in basewallet.js that the identity will be used as a label accessing to the wallet. So i replaced the identity value from 'admin' with 'XYZ' and now it works.   Maybe looking at the source code it's better to introduce a new option in the GatewayOptions to specify the label and distinguish this from the identity, with a default value as the identity wich remains mandatory.         ></description> </Issue>

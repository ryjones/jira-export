CDATA I like this proposal although it will get a little tricky in terms of keeping things in sync.  We'll need to decide how we run CI between the core fabric and the SDKs, although my assumption will be that we'll have release branches / tags which should make things easier.  We can also include test cases in fabric which use the SDK like an end user would (e.g. npm install) rather than building, etc.  We should probably also consider having a trigger from the core fabric to the SDK repo for CI as well.  ></body> </Action>

What we need is to have stability of the exposed APIs between the two (well any SDK and fabric peer/membersrvc)." created="2016-09-19 12:38:00.0" updateauthor="christopherferris" updated="2016-09-19 12:38:00.0"/>

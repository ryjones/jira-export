CDATA Scenario: * A function in chaincode throws an error - e.g. queryCar() is invoked with argument "CAR33" - this car doesn't exist, so throws appropriate error message * In client application, when calling evaluateTransaction (i.e. query) on the queryCar chaincode function with arg "CAR33", then the error that gets caught has the message "Error evaluating transaction: No peers available to query".Â  It then contains the actual error that is returned by the chaincode function.  The error handler in 'singlequeryhandler.js' in fabric-network is assuming that all errors are caused by lack of connection to a peer rather than an explicit error raised by the chaincode function.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I can successfully send errors from my chaincode, however the node SDK seems to have a misleading error message when this happens, e.g. {quote}{{Error evaluating transaction: No peers available to query. Errors:  {"message":"transaction returned with failure: Car CAR9999999 does not exist"}} {quote} There were peers available to query- the (expected) error came from my chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA we'd like to have the unit tests driven by node.js completely, instead of relying on native shell scripts which would be difficult to develop and maintain for the multiple environments: maxOS, windows, Ubuntu, etc.  most difficult part is using node.js program to manage the configuration, launching and tearing down of the docker-based target environment.   ~rennman  started this changeset https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2423/, which needs to be cleaned up by removing all the old tests so that it becomes a narrowly focused utility to launch docker-compose based target environments with different parameters (SOLO vs. Kafka, LevelDB vs. couchdb, TLS vs. no TLS, COP vs. standard CA etc.)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This issue is related to FAB-271.   From the generated documentation here: file:///C:/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node/doc  I've copied the page for class Peer into an odt file and annotated it with document suggestions.   General principles of API documentation: Documentation for each API should answer these questions: ◾Result: What's the result of issuing this API ◾Requirements: What's required to issue this API ? ◾Restrictions: List any restrictions ◾Tips: If you can ignore what the tip says, it's a valid tip. Otherwise, it must be a result, requirement, or restriction.  Some IBM documentation actually has headings: Results, Requirements, Restrictions (and optionally) Tips.   I will attach the odt document. It is based on hfc 0.0.2 (just before moving from github to Gerrit).    ></description> </Issue>

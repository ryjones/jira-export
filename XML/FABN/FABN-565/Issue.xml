CDATA I have needed to get access to the client configuration of the common connection profile. Specifically I need to get the organisation information but would also want to access the wallet field in the future. For now my code to get access to the organisation is as follows {code} static getOrgConfig(client) { let networkConfig = client._network_config; let clientConfig = networkConfig.getClientConfig(); let orgConfig; if (clientConfig && clientConfig.organization) { orgConfig = networkConfig.getOrganization(clientConfig.organization); } return orgConfig; } {code} The reason I need access to an organisation is because for the following (raised as separate JIRAs) 1. Access to the MSPid of the client organisation required to create a user instance  2. Get the peers for an organisation so I can register the event hubs 3. try to determine the list of peers to install chaincode to  But I still would need access to the wallet property (in the near future) of the ClientConfig so need the ability to get to the client config.   ></description> </Issue>

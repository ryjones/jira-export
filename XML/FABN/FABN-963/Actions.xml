CDATA Since we already try to reconnect disconnected event hubs for each transaction where we want to listen to commit events, I think this is a proposed solution/workaround to something underlying the ChannelEventHub (e.g. grpc) failing. Some detail on the actual problem would help.  It might be worth trying to address this at a level in the code closer to where the issue is occurring, so perhaps within the ChannelEventHub itself.  ></body> </Action>

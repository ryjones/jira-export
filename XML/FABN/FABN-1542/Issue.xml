CDATA The gateway options enable the setting of many aspects of the gateway connection, not least the event/query strategies to be used.  In the event of a strategy failure message, i receive the following stack trace:  {{2020-04-16T17:40:20.070Z -  33mwarn 39m:  TransactionEventHandler : strategyFail: commit failure for transaction "65acddb82ef95be4f9e918b4e63c1926d684dfb7d28f1ca0e2dd7cb2a7c227ae": Error: No successful events received}} {{(node:18210) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: No successful events received}} {{ at AnyForTxStrategy.checkCompletion (/home/nkl199/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/lib/node_modules/fabric-network/lib/impl/event/anyfortxstrategy.js:31:20)}} {{ at AnyForTxStrategy.errorReceived (/home/nkl199/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/lib/node_modules/fabric-network/lib/impl/event/transactioneventstrategy.js:61:14)}} {{ at TransactionEventHandler.eventCallback (/home/nkl199/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/lib/node_modules/fabric-network/lib/impl/event/transactioneventhandler.js:92:27)}} {{ at CommitListenerSession.start (/home/nkl199/.nvm/versions/node/v10.20.1/lib/node_modules/fabric-network/lib/impl/event/commitlistenersession.js:27:18)}}  Â   Whilst I can see the type of error and the strategy (does the Steps dance) to which it relates, it could be a little more helpful. For instance, I do not know how long the wait period was for this - and users may want to confirm that they are configuring the timeout correctly (equally that it is being respected within the strategy (Steps++)   It would be more useful if the error message was similar to:  {{Error: No successful events received within timeout <timeout_value>Â }}{{at AnyForTxStrategy.checkCompletion }}  ></description> </Issue>

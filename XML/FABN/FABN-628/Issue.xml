CDATA The current node SDK has a static method called `decodeBlock()` which reimplements `decodeBlockHeader()`. This should rather just be made to call the function instead as there is no different in the `block.header` value and the value returned from the `decodeBlockHeader()` method.  This is mostly a code cleanup.  ></description> </Issue>

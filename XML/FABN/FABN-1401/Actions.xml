CDATA I also found the same issue, but not sure if anyone had already utilised this function to retrieve the address with port, even it is not reasonable.  I suggest fixing this, if we can make sure that the impact to the existing versions of Node SDK is minor.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA But after investigation: # For non-discover network, the peer.name depends on the connection profile, so then the name will be arbitrary name what user specifies. # For discover network, the peer.name is actually the peer endpoint, what compose of host and port, respond by the discover service of the network, returned by target peer. This is also reasonable, this make the name to be unique. # The CORE_PEER_ID will only be used in for the docker vm starting, it seems won't be used to identify the peer.  So then, it seems hard to be fixed now.  Hope anyone can help review this more.  ></body> </Action>

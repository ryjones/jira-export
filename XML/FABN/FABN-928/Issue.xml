CDATA The Common Connection Profile defines the section BCCSP. This would be used to provide details of PKCS11 connection to an HSM. The node-sdk doesn't support this section so support for this section should be added.  I am also wondering if there is a requirement to have a single CA definition that describes all the different names that it hosts (which partition the CA).  ></description> </Issue>

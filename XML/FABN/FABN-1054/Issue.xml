CDATA I'm using the api methods to listen for block events and have specified a start block. The documentation states, "Setting a startBlock may confuse other event listeners, therefore only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when a startBlock is being used."  Even so, I was surprised when submitting a transaction using the fabric-network module failed with, "Error: This ChannelEventHub is not open to event listener registrations" given it is a higher level of abstraction and should probably maintain its own pool of channel even hubs.  Perhaps this could be handled with additional handler strategies, although I'm not sure if there's any reason not to just maintain a pool of fabric-network event hubs.     (In 1.4.0-beta2)     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA If the EventHub.connect() call fails, maybe due to incorrect grpc settings (wrong certs, wrong url, etc.) the SDK logs the error but the application doesn't get notified because there is no error callback for the application to hook into the error path.  The registerXXXEvent() methods do provide error callbacks that will get called on error conditions like above, but that requires the listeners to be registered before the connect() gets call.  However, you can call registerXXXEvent() before connect() because right now these methods checks if the connection has been established.  ></description> </Issue>

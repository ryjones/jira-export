CDATA The fabric-ca-client can ask from the fabric-CA to produce a CRL to revoke a user.  However (unless I'm mistaken) - there isn't an API to add this CRL to the channel config and issue a channel update.  Therefore - there is no way of revoking a node/client in the API of the node SDK.   ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  do i have the details correct?      Seems this is something that users of Fabric would've liked to exist.      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54673179/fully-revoke-a-user-certificates-in-hyperledger-fabric-node-sdk    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46410592/unable-to-revoke-a-certificate-or-enrollment-id-with-fabric-node-sdk/46412583    https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric?msg=pSjRXmfGtK4M3X678    https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric?msg=hDaDxkn527qLnDkjg         /cc  ~denyeart         ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Trying to deploy a fabric-composer business network and what used to work fine on the 1.0.0 alpha release of hyperledger fabric and the node-sdk now fails when I attempt to do an install proposal.  The message I get back is  {code:java} Error: Received message larger than max (7633274 vs. 4194304) at /home/vagrant/src/fabric-composer/packages/composer-connector-hlfv1/node_modules/grpc/src/node/src/client.js:434:17 {code}  I don't see anything in the peer logs to indicate anything different. I know that grpc has a default limit of 4Mb for messages (which is where 4194304) comes from. I don't know if this limit has been introduced somehow by the node sdk or if the message size has increased dramatically. I have got around it for now by changing the constructor in Remote.js to include the following line  {code:java} this._options 'grpc.max_receive_message_length'  = 20*1024*1024; {code} setting a limit to 20Mb (-1 is supposed to set it to infinite but there have been reported problems of this not being accepted so I chose a fixed amount for now).  This is using node-sdk 1.0.0.snapshot.17 with some changes taken directly from source to address events needed to be signed in order to work with the docker images released at version ===> FABRIC# - 7e0cff2 ===> FABRIC CA# - e583181 ===> FABRIC SDK JAVA - 981f70d     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA it'd be great to include sample node.js application built on "express", so demonstrate how the Node.js SDK is supposed to be used in the context of a stateless web application: * design a nice UI to help users understand basic concepts (chaincode deploy, transaction invocation, etc.) * code sample should show usage of the proposal and transaction submission API's * for the sake of being self-contained (and not require a complex steps to set it up), it should rely on the COP server to do user registration and enrollment. but need to make sure this part is described as optional.   ></description> </Issue>

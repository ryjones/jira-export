CDATA  ~zhaochy  After building the project, the application couldn't find the js-file because the file structur wasn't the same in the build forder. We had to seperatly add the file to our build path and to change the settings in the default.json. Otherwise he hadn't found the file.  This is caused by the fact that the code which i posted above is requiring the file at runtime. So the building tool dosen't take care of this file.   This is just a design issue.  Do you need more informations?  ></body> </Action>

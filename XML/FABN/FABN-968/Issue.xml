CDATA We need to be able to track a request end to end and the transaction id is the way to do this. We should also look at the lower level node-sdk logging methods as well to include a transaction id.  I don't believe we need to include the full transaction id, probably the first 8 characters are enough but we should be consistent with how core fabric logs things. We should also ensure that as part of the hardening and serviceability work going into 1.4 that we help drive better logging at the correct level in core fabric and chaincode as well.  ></description> </Issue>

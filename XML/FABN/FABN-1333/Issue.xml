CDATA The following code in the network class doesn't provide any help as to why there isn't {noformat}		 if (ledgerPeers.length === 0) { 	const msg = 'no suitable peers available to initialize from'; 	logger.error('_initializeInternalChannel: ' + msg); 	throw new Error(msg); } {noformat} It also varies depending on whether discovery is used or not. So if discovery is used then the reason is that it can't find any peers defined for the invoker organisation. If discovery is off then it cannot find any peers in the channel with the query role. It would be really handy to output something more, for example if the user registers an identity with the wrong mspid and use discovery then you get this error but the user cannot determine their mistake from this.  ></description> </Issue>

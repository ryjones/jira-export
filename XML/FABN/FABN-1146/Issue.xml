CDATA According to Fabric SDK 1.3 and later, while there are multiple discovery peers available, the sdk always chooses the first one.  (Source:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.4/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js   L3743)  If the very first discovery peer is down or not working, node sdk doesn't try another discovery peer even if there are multiple discovery peers available in configuration file. So the sdk wouldn't work as there are no endorsor_plans available.  As a developer, A feature is need that if current discovery peer was not working, sdk would try next available discovery peer automatically until every discovery peer is tried.     ></description> </Issue>

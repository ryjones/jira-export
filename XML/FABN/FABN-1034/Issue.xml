When multiple transactions are sent concurrently, multiple calls to EventHub.connect can be in flight concurrently. In this scenario, some event hub connection callbacks are never invoked and the client transaction invocation hangs indefinitely waiting on the callback." priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-11-27 14:55:54.0" updated="2018-11-28 09:34:50.0" resolutiondate="2018-11-28 09:34:50.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="47106"/>

CDATA I think gulp was part of the reason we couldn't enable node 12 in the builds for node-sdk. I've removed that dependency so it shouldn't cause us problems now. Node 12 is running happily in master  Also allow the builds to run against multiple node versions that we support. I think azure can run these sequentially  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently the BlockDecoder that decodes blocks does not decode ChaincodeInvocationSpec's. It should be doing this however.  I've written some code that fits my own purposes which does most of the decoding. It is not complete though. The code is attached to this issue, it may be of use if someone picks this up.  ></description> </Issue>

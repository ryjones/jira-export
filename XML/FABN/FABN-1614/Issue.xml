CDATA In the current implementation of fabric-network, the transaction is submitted to Org Peers for endorsements, as per the default chaincode endorsement policy.  However for State Based Endorsement (SBE), we need capability to target Orgs for endorsement different than chaincode endorsement policy.       Current Workaround:  In our current scenario, working with fabric-network 1.4.x, we have default chaincode endorsement policy for 1 out N Orgs endorsing. However for create asset transactions we modify the endorsement policy for the key to be 2 specific Orgs(instead of any 1 default of chaincode) using SBE.   The current workaround in place is setEndorsingPeers on Transaction, and then submit the transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

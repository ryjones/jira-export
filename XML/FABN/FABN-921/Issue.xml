CDATA Â Document the service discovery collection and chaincode-to-chaincode support implemented in FABN-842 and FABN-843.  Some API reference doc was added as part of the dev tasks, but we could use some more text around how applications use the hint (especially for cc2cc scenarios the reference doc could be clarified about "called" chaincodes), and a brief mention of these scenarios in the existing service discovery tutorial.  ></description> </Issue>

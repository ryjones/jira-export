CDATA The old Jenkins CI pipeline published docs to:  http://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/   The new Azure Pipelines CI publishes docs to:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node   All references to the API docs need to be updated to point to the new site. This may include links in the main Fabric docs as well as any README material in the fabric-sdk-node repository.  To avoid confusion and help people migrate to the correct site, all content on the old docs site should be removed and replaced with an index.html and 404.html that point to the new site.  ></description> </Issue>

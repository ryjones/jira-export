CDATA Take the sample standalone application that is included in the documentation attached to  FAB-160 and include this under directory fabric/examples/sdk/node/standalone (or something similar).  This sample needs to be tested.  The following suggested enhancements are copied from FAB-143 (which is closed as a duplicate to this): 1) enrolls a bootstrap ID ('admin'), 2) sets registrar, 3) registers and enrolls a new ID 4) deploys, queries, and invokes using the new ID. It should deploy one of our samples by URL.   ></description> </Issue>

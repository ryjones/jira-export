CDATA The current integration tests in sdk-node lack checks for the endorsement policy in invoking a chaincode.  In e2e/invoke-transaction.js, SDK sends a transaction proposal to two peers, and gets two endorsements from them, which is sufficient for the current chaincode policy that requires endorsements from two orgs (as in e2eUtils.buildChaincodeProposal). To improve this test, we need to add some negative test cases to ensure that the policy works, such as one to check if it fails when only one endorsement is attached to the transaction request.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently the node-sdk depends on grpc-node, which is being deprecated and replaced by grpc-js.  In conjunction, node-sdk currently depends on protobufjs 5, which needs to be converted to protobufjs 6, in order to support grpc-js.  So, current work breakdown is: * convert from protobufjs 5 to 6 * convert from grpc-node to grpc-js  Â   ></description> </Issue>

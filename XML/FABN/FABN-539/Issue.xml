CDATA The unit tests executed by  fabric-sdk-node/gulp test are controlled by fabric-sdk-node/build/tasks/test.js, in the task called pre-test.   When fabric-sdk-node/test/unit/end-to-end.js is included, gulp test hangs.  However, I have no trouble running end-to-end.js from the command line:  node end-to-end.js.  It's desirable to include end-to-end.js in gulp's pre-test task so we get a better unit test coverage map.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The Fabric 1.1 feature of CouchDB indexing is not working while using Node SDK. The index definition files were placed in the specified directory accompanying the chaincode, but was unable to find the index implemented in CouchDB (verified by viewing the existing indexes via CouchDB web interface), and the peer log does not mention about finding any index definitions.  *To reproduce:* A modified balance transfer sample was used, to activate CouchDB state database for the peers. 1) docker-compose.yaml file was changed (see attached), 2) index definition were placed in specified folder in the accompanying go chaincode folder. 3) and the rest was run as directed.  *Result:* 1) The CouchDB container has the values to "a" and "b" but no index. 2) The peer log does not indicate finding any index definitions.  *Expectation*: CouchDB has the defined indexes.  ></description> </Issue>

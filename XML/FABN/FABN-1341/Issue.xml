CDATA The packaging code in the SDK for Fabric v1.4 lacks general purpose options for controlling which files in a directory get packaged into a CDS file. Node.js has the option to handle a .npmignore file, but the other platforms do not have the same option. This is a particular problem with Java, because the build directories containing uber JARs end up in the CDS package, then get dropped the other end.  The solution here is to introduce an optional .fabricignore file that if found, will allow the user to control which files and directories get excluded from the CDS file. This will apply to the new chaincode lifecycle as well, as similar code is in the SDK for packaging new .tar.gz files.  ></description> </Issue>

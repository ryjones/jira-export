CDATA commit 8266a16b4fa363335fa85253cf44b4fed784c272 Author: jjjjibm <jcwolf@us.ibm.com> Date:   Thu Feb 9 18:46:30 2017 -0500  node-SDK Fix FAB-2158 pkcs11-tests.js fails  The test pkcs11-tests.js was looking for softHSM libraries in '/usr/lib/libacsp-pkcs11.so' based on process.platform <> 'darwin'. The libraries are actually in /usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so. I added 'linux' to the list of platforms with SoftHSM libraries in /usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so.

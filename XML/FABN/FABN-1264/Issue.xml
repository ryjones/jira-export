CDATA Hello. This issue is raised after  this discussion|https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-node?msg=s49JsNpPBWa22ynyg      According to the  documentation|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/module-fabric-network.Gateway.html#Gateway__anchor  there is no way to verify if a gateway is connected or not.  It would be helpful to be able to ask the gateway if it is currently connected or not. For example: {code:java} gateway.connected() {code} This way the developer could avoid using annex variable, such as:    {code:java} if (!gatewayConnected) { await gateway.connect(parsedProfile, options); node.log('connected to gateway'); gatewayConnected = true; } else { node.log("Gateway already connected"); }{code}    Moreover, as outlined by  ~davidkel  during the discussion, preventing a gateway to connect multiple times could avoid problems     Thank you.     SDK Version: 1.4  ></description> </Issue>

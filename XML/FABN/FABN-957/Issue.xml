CDATA The metrics I think could be useful are - time from sending proposal response to receiving all responses - time taken to send to orderer and get response from orderer - time taken to get a response from a query request - time taken for event hub to connect  Some of the other types of metrics may have to be implemented by the users of the node-sdk low level api.   ></description> </Issue>

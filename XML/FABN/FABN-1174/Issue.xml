CDATA There are issues with the current key-val store and cryptosuite implementation: - Key value stores return a Promise in the constructor - Cryptosuite implementations do not honour the interface for generateEphemeralKey, and overload the generateKey method instead  The former would benefit with an initialize method and the latter should be decomposed to honour the interface, with the `generateKey` calling `generateEphemeralKey` before persisting the result.  ></description> </Issue>

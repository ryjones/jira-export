CDATA To improve integration test of fabric-sdk-node, "Instantiate Chaincode" needs negative test cases. "channel.sendInstantiateProposal(request)" sends an instantiation proposal to Peers to instantiate Chaincode. In detail, LSCC (Lifecycle System Chaincode) instantiates chaincode which is installed on Peers. We need to add negative test cases to check if sdk gets error response from Peers in accordance with the check logic in LSCC.  The followings are negative test cases. - instantiate call fails with non-existent Chaincode version - instantiate call fails with non-existent Chaincode name - instantiate call fails by instantiating the same Chaincode twice     ></description> </Issue>

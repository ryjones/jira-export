CDATA The first phase of BCCSP implementation was done in sprint 5 with interface definition, and a default implementation for software-based key generation with ECDSA, including sign() and verify() support.  this 2nd part is to complete the rest of the interface with encrypt/decrypt and key import.  key derivation is not needed until client-side TCert generation is supported.  ></description> </Issue>

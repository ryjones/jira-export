CDATA The new Fabric programming model defines a set of high-level abstractions and API for writing client applications  that invoke transactions in a smart contract.  The client side API has been implemented in the `fabric-network` package for the Node SDK.  This is designed to be the entry point for developers who need to invoke smart contracts.  The `fabric-client` package will continue to exist as a low-level 'implementation' API, and will no longer be intended to be used directly by the client developer.  As such, it will be deprecated for this purpose.  The `fabric-client` API and implementation code will be radically simplified and rationalised in order to improve maintainability.  The `fabric-network` API will continue to pick up capabilities (i.e. some of the admin APIs) in order to support this transition.  This Epic contains a number of proposed changes to the node SDK that take advantage of the major version bump from v1.4.x to v2.0.0.  Some of these changes will mean that applications written using the low-level `fabric-client` (at v1.x) APIs might need code changes to continue working with the v2.0.0 `fabric-client` module.  It is intended that client applications written to the high-level `fabric-network` API will continue to work unchanged when moving to the v2 SDK.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~jimthematrix  Except utils.js (Using internal source file of fabric-client) I think remaining things been taken care in the example provided with FAB-2967.   *utils.js* is mainly used for getting the *Nonce* , Can we fix the length to 24 for alpha version of the example app, Please suggest  ?   Also to load the proto file we are using the internal resource, I am not sure if we can avoid this for Alpha  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/examples/balance-transfer/app/join-channel.js#L32-L33    ></body> </Action>

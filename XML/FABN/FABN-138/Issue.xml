CDATA There is a distinct lack of a working example app for fabric-sdk-node, and I and others have had no luck in trying to unravel the e2e integration test into a working app.  It's arguably necessary to app developers to have this example working and brought up to date.  Criteria for usability: - Have examples/balance-transfer be a self-contained app, with no external dependence on "getting started".  Preferably have the whole thing run via single `docker-compose up` command -- this would include services for CA, orderer, peers, and finally the application itself. - Have the configuration sources (the files that go into the channel transaction envelope) all be present, and have the command which builds the channel transaction file (and other files I may be forgetting/unaware of) available to run via script. - It should be obvious from the example what the dependencies of all necessary components are for configuring the services, configuring the channel, other configurations, and building the app. - No code in the example should directly require() an internal source file of fabric-client or fabric-ca-client (as helper.js currently does) -- this indicates improper encapsulation and is confusing to someone using the API docs as a guide.   ></description> </Issue>

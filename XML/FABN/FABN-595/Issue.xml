CDATA  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L1235   Channel::sendInstantiateProposal returnsÂ ProposalResponseObject which is nothing but an array of 3 different types of objects.  IMHO, this is not ideal approach even though javascript allows you to have an array with different types. You should have returned an object with required/optional fields.  It is inconsistent with respect to other APIs, hard to understand by the app developers and almost make it impossible to write types (Typescript) for your APIs.  ></description> </Issue>

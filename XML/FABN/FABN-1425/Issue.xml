CDATA The fabric-network Transaction class has a method called *setEndorsingPeers(peers)*. This method is useful when working with private data collections or when the endorsement policies allow the client to select the organisations that should be endorsing.  The client apps are concerned with getting an endorsement from organisations. At the moment, because the method needs to receive a list of peers, it leaves it to the application to use service discovery, the connection profile or another config method to figure out which peers are required.  It would be a nice improvement if you offered a method called either: *setEndorsingOrgs* or *setEndorsingMSPs*, which dynamically determined the peer to use. It would enable the client application to work at the level of abstraction of the Organisation.  ></description> </Issue>

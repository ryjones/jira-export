CDATA For any third party signing, please refer and make use of 'offline client side signing' features with design documented in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gj5XB7yS-pfjpvZEUQh5lBGSIE6aQemu8A69tAYQtTc  The implement is available from fabric-sdk-node release-1.3 and on.    ></body> </Action>
<Action id="59085" issue="39134" author="fifahuihua" type="comment" body="hi,  ~davidkhala  I reviewed the design document attached by you. And I found that this design can&apos;t match my requirement, because we can&apos;t get the certification from third signature platform, we just send the content to be signed by signature server, can&apos;t get the content of keys and certification. So we have to continue follow this issue. Thanks." created="2019-04-10 00:55:43.0" updateauthor="fifahuihua" updated="2019-04-10 00:55:43.0"/>

CDATA The certification issued by CA server, we saved it into local db, and can get it.    Sorry, it seems that I misunderstand the method const \{ proposal, txId } = channel.generateUnsignedProposal(transactionProposalReq, mspId, certPem); For this code line, the certPem should be CA issued certification, not the certification of third signature platform.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA these are the main classes of BCCSP. refactor the code to support the new interface and rename it as ECDSA_AES. the secure hashing part will be made pluggable and done in a separate task  In this first step, only implement the CryptoSuite (corresponding to BCCSP interface) APIs related to key gen, creating and verifying signatures. encrypt/decrypt to be filled in later.  ></description> </Issue>

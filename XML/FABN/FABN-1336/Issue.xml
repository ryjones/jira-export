CDATA The fabric-network integration tests are not running in the master branch. If this is intentional and the tests have been superseded by scenario (Cucumber) tests then: # The redundant integration test code should be removed. # The scenario tests should be re-written in Typescript as the integration tests implcitly test the correctness of the Typescript definitions. # Coverage of the scenario tests may need to be extended as there are some cases where the integration tests have failed due to code changes where the scenario tests have continued passing.  Â   I suspect the tests are being accidentally omitted by the shouldRunTests() function in build/tasts/test.js, but it's not clear to me why this is happening in master and not release-1.4.  ></description> </Issue>

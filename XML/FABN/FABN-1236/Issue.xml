CDATA Hello everyone i am trying to use the discovery service with node sdk client the problem is that the endorsement fails because discovery retrieves an endorsement plan with missmatching name fields. i am attaching the endorsing plan, the failing debug log as it sends the proposal to the same peer, and the channel.getChannelPeers() so u can see that the plan is setting the wrong names.   {code:java} Â {code}  ></description> </Issue>

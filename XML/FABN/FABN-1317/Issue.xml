CDATA My cacount is 2.  Assume the default CA's name is CA1 and the internal CA instance's name is CA2.  By default, when I make a call to the delete function, all the requests are redirected to the default ca i.e. CA1 since there is no option to pass caName in the function. In the fabric-ca swagger file, if you try the DELTE /api/v1/identities/\{id} api, there is a clear option to pass the caName as a parameter.  ></description> </Issue>

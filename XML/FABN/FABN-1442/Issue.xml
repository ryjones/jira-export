CDATA Recently, I war learning to do some development on Hyperledger Fabric platform. Today, I tried to query  the information stored in a block. I  built a loop body, and put 30 pieces of data into the state database, but when I use {code:java} queryBlockByTxID(tx_id,peer,true,false){code} to query the block where this transaction is, and found there just one piece of transaction in a block.  configurations of batch：    {code:java} BatchTimeout: 30s   BatchSize:     MaxMessageCount: 10     AbsoluteMaxBytes: 98 MB     PreferredMaxBytes: 512 KB{code} Log of the peer node:  {code:java}  2020-01-03 07:26:10.766 UTC  gossip.privdata  StoreBlock -> INFO 2dc  mychannel  Received block  93  from buffer 2020-01-03 07:26:10.767 UTC  committer.txvalidator  Validate -> INFO 2dd  mychannel  Validated block  93  in 0ms 2020-01-03 07:26:10.825 UTC  kvledger  CommitWithPvtData -> INFO 2de  mychannel  Committed block  93  with 1 transaction(s) in 57ms (state_validation=3ms block_and_pvtdata_commit=5ms state_commit=48ms) commitHash= 31892868d4b19940afe732988f18f74e80cbabdc52d4a902f6898c263f8a8f3c {code} In my mind, one block should store more than one transaction, and 30s is enough to submit 10 transactions to blockchain.  I think {code:java} MaxMessageCount:10{code} means the maximum numbers of transactions that a block can store. but these congfigures don't seem to work.  In addition, how to query the size of a block? I have not found the API.  ></description> </Issue>

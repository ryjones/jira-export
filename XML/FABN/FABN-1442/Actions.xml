CDATA Hi  ~Flyyellow  - it appears this is more of a question rather than a user story, so I've moved this to be a bug. Have you considered asking on RocketChat?  https://chat.hyperledger.org|https://chat.hyperledger.org/    I've reviewed this with some of the other maintainers and we're not necessarily clear on this being a fabric-sdk-node bug. How are you setting the BatchTimeout?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The quertion about BatchTimeout, not a matter of fabric-node-sdk.   BatchTimeout can be setted in configtx.yaml.   I think fabric-sdk-node should provide a method to get the size of block.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So we're thinking you can use queryBlock on a channel:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/Channel.html#queryBlock__anchor|https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/Channel.html#queryBlock__anchor  which would return you a block:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/global.html#Block|https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/global.html#Block   There are some typos in those docs that I'll raise issues for, but I'm hoping that gives you a starting point  ></body> </Action>

I have 2 orderer service nodes, one with nodeport 32000 and 32001. To create the situation where my first orderer fails, i changed the url of my first orderer in my common connection profile to be 32002. When I used node-sdk fabric-client v1.3.0 to invoke and query transactions, it failed after it detected that it couldnt connect to 32002. However, when i changed to node-sdk fabric-client v1.2.0, it could work with multiple orderers. Then on the advice of  ~davidkel , i tried with node-sdk fabric-client v1.4.0-rc1, i got the same error as that of v1.3 and so i decided to raise this issue." priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-12-18 09:06:47.0" updated="2019-01-25 09:24:48.0" resolutiondate="2019-01-25 09:24:48.0" votes="0" watches="6" workflowId="47759"/>

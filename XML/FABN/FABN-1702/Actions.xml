CDATA Hi my HSM is a Thales Luna V6.3 I have tried importing my private key only, my private key and certificate in different steps, my private key and certificate on the same file, but still I get the same error is it a problem with the way I'm inserting the certificates in the HSM? or do you need to recreate some context in the app to import an existing key pair certificate in an HSM Wallet?     I was looking at this article  Peer failed getting private key| https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/peer_failed_getting_private/75093038   looking at my certificate, I can see that it has an subject key id but the number I see doesn't match the number in the error, and I'm a bit lost because it says the skid its calculated from the private key but I only see it in the certificate extension.     This is the number I see in the skid from keyStore Explorer in the certificate: Key Identifier: 0xF9AE C4C7 7329 2C18 5616 F05A 9A89 8FBE AE54 9AD5  This is the error: no key with SKI 02174c678ed1911b86dee963b1423c324f0f43395878c56728eb7ccdda74ec66 found  Maybe its the same number in different formats but for me these two are both hexadecimal numbers, so is there a problem in the way I'm generating my certificate? why the two numbers are so different?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok I checked with Thales what happened and foud out that when I imported the keys there is an id property that was empty and that I also needed to import the public key and set the same id.  Even then I was getting this error:  {code:javascript} key size mismatch, class: 256, ski: 384 {code}  That was happening because I was creating ECDSA certificates of 384 bit and probably there's a property that is not getting set with the key size. So tried again with a 256 key size key pair and everything worked.  So in brief, importing both the public key and the private key and setting the id property for them worked.  You can close the ticket now, sorry for the inconvenience.   ></body> </Action>

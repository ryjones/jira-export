CDATA right now the CI job that publishes the generated doc to fabric-sdk-node.github.io always copies the newly generated files into the existing repository. This makes it impossible to remove files and would leave out-of-date files in the remote repository.  it should instead first delete everything from the local repo after git clone, before copying the newly generated files into it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hello,     We have the following code to package a smart contract (using the 'Package' class from 'fabric-client').    {code:java} const pkg: any = await Package.fromDirectory({name: name,            version: version,            path: contractPath,            type: language as ChaincodeType,            metadataPath: metadataPath ? metadataPath : null        }); {code}    I'm just wondering what path I should be passing through to 'metadataPath' - is this the path to the 'META-INF' directory or the 'contract-metadata' directory?     For further context, we set it to be the META-INF path, which I suspect is why a user is seeing this - https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/2699  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The contract metadata did not exist when the packaging of fabric-client 1.4 was coded. Index information was the only known meta information.  This data must within the 'contractPath', and it will be packaged up.  If you wish to supply your own metadata, the following rules apply * it must be in a file called {{metadata.json}} * this must be in a directory called {{contract-metadata}} * this directory must be a peer of the package.json file of your contract   The packaging code uses the 'metadataPath' argument of your code snippet to build a 'META-INF' directory of the final package. It takes ALL files under this location that have "*.json*" extension and adds them to the package as /META-INF/<filePath>, where filePath is the part of the JSON path name that is under the  metadataPath.  if metadataPath is '/something/moresomething/mymeta' and a file is '/something/moresomething/mymeta/statedb/couchdb/indexes/index.json' then the package would contain '/META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes/index.json'.     Collection json files are read and the info placed not within the chaincode package, but placed into the gRPC request when instantiating.  ></body> </Action>

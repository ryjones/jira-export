CDATA While testing Gemalto Data Protection on Demond HSM PAAS, I happened to be unable to perform an enrollment of a user defined in my ca to submit a query on my channel.  I contacted Gemalto developer working on Fabric and he provided the following patch to have my application running successfully.  It modifies the Client.js file and  the _setUserFromConfig() call.  I attached this patch.  I would appreciate if this could be pushed to the master after review for 1.2+ and 1.1 releases.     I included the RegisterUser.js code as test case.  It uses a profile network.yaml.  I provided one as sample.         ></description> </Issue>

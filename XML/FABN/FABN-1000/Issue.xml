CDATA When using the fabric-network module within VSCode, I get an error saying:  {noformat} Expected event hubs to be a Promise but was object {noformat}  This error comes from the constructor for AbstractEventStrategy.  On debugging, what gets passed in is actually a Promise, but not the exact same class of Promise that seems to be available to AbstractEventStrategy - the instanceof check fails.  We should use the is-promise module instead, which does a check that the object is "thenable" - it has a .then() method.  ></description> </Issue>

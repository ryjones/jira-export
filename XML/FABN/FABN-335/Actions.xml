CDATA  I have written a sample program here https://github.com/ratnakar-asara/NodeSdkSample/tree/master/events  If I rerun the program again I could see it is getting stuck after deploy.  So to avoid the problem I had to add a hack in the code , which checks if the chaincode is already deployed it will check for chaincodeID and proceeds further with Invoke and Query.  To reproduce the problem run the program with below sequence of commands:  Step1: *node node event-sample.js*  Step2:  Once chaincode deployment is successful, delete the chaincodeID file generated  *rm chaincodeID*  Step3 :  Retry deploying the chaincode again *node node event-sample.js* It hangs at this step and wouldn't proceed further.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is actually expected behavior. Without eventhub enables, the sdk times out on deploys and invokes and assumes that they are successful. In this case of a redeploy, its actually a failure. Currently you cannot reploy onto an active chaincode.  There is a secondary issue being reported of a hang in the test script. This is likely due to not calling "chain.eventHubDisconnect();". This is limitation having to do with grpc streams that must be closed prior to exit.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't see it comes in to *error* event , I don't see this log printed when last time I executed the program https://github.com/ratnakar-asara/NodeSdkSample/blob/master/events/event-sample.js#L132  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm not clear on the approach being taken to address this, but there are a few things that we must fix.  1) we need a README - currently there is nothing that speaks to installing or using the SDK. Instead, we are greeted with: ERROR: No README data found! 2) no reference to the source. Most other NPM modules link to the source's GH repository/ 3) no link to Hyperledger project. There's a mention but no link.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have updated the npm package to version 0.5.3 here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hfc  This version is compatible with the v0.5-developer-preview-1 fabric branch (now archived Fabric05 branch). The update includes the latest updates to fix a break (caused by a third party) that occurred last Friday 09/09 as well as updates to the README.md. It certainly looks much better and includes more detailed installation instructions regarding compatibility, though it's not perfect. I am still trying to understand how to get those auto-generated docs up there on npm. I thought I had figured it out, but my theory on how to do that didn't turn out to fix it. I'll dig a bit more on this and publish once again when I'm ready to push out version 0.6.x to npm, as the README.md is a single file. There is not a specific README.md for a specific version, so it will update either way. Please stay tuned for another updated later today or tomorrow.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

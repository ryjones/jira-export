CDATA  ~z21921   Note that the error "Chat -> ERRO 1a8 Error during Chat, stopping handler: stream error: code = 1 desc = "context canceled"" always happens when the event listener client process is terminated. So that's not the actual error that caused the node SDK to report the "Unhandled 'error' event.  Please provide more information on reproducing the bug, or logs. Until then, we are going to to assume it's a user/application error.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Looking at the TypeScript definitions, Channel.sendTransaction() returns a ProposalResponseObject, which itself is defined as:   type ProposalResponseObject =  Client.ProposalResponse  , Client.Proposal ;   Looking at the implementation code (client-utils.sendPeersProposal), each of the items in the Client.ProposalResponse   may be either a Client.ProposalResponse or an Error. Perhaps the ProposalResponseObject type definition should be:   type ProposalResponseObject =  Array<Client.ProposalResponse | Error>, Client.Proposal ;    ~caroline-church  Am I understanding your problem correctly, and would this solve it?  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com    ~zhaochy  What do you think?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="53697" issue="34995" author="caroline-church" type="comment" body="The implementation is wrong it should send back a ProposalResponse in both success and error cases. The only difference should be in the status code and the status message. This is how http responses work. You don&apos;t get a completely different object structure when you get an error to when you get success" created="2018-11-21 17:35:25.0" updateauthor="caroline-church" updated="2018-11-21 17:35:25.0"/>

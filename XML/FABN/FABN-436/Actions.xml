The work around is well understood by node.js programmers, they will just issue the NPM command to install the missing packages. Many users will not even see this issue as the packages will be installed already. It is a low risk change." created="2017-06-29 18:33:11.0" updateauthor="harrisob@us.ibm.com" updated="2017-06-29 18:33:11.0"/>

CDATA I think this issue is not problem in most situation, especially in developement phaze. I saw this issue when I transplanted my application which include fabric-client module from developing environment to Docker container. Because "npm install" was executed in completely clean status, and all modules did not defined "nano" in package.json.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA not sure how our CI could have passed if these are real dependencies and are missing. it's likely that they are transitive dependencies and are already installed as a result of other dependency modules.  in any case, deferring to v1.0.1 to further investigate and fix.  ></body> </Action>

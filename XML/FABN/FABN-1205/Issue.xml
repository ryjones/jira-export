CDATA The problem here is that the default for chaincode event listeners is to connect and receive filtered blocks. There is no documentation or guidance about how to receive full blocks. Handling filtered chaincode events is going to be a niche use (or not used at all) and that the common use case is to use full blocks.   Ideally the default for chaincode (and possibly block) events should be to use full blocks and use an option to disable rather than having to specify an undocumented option to set filtered to false.  ></description> </Issue>

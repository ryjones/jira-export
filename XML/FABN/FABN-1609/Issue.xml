CDATA Reported from Chinese community  “smtCL”  The gateway disconnect could not clean up all grpc connections entirely if client is configured to use with several service endpoints inside.  This is a 'GC leakage'. It might potentially exhaust computing resource if we re-create, close and repeat for gateway.  Plan to fix this is to add a disconnect function to fabric-common/client and add a line of clean client to gateway.ts  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently SDK provides helper functions (like verifyProposalResponse and compareProposalResponseResults) to help applications to handle proposal responses from endorsers. But applications still have to do some work (which are not application specific logics in nature) to enforce endorsement policies on their own. So some more wrapper functions in SDK would be helpful to give an option especially for cases with simple/typical endorsement policies.

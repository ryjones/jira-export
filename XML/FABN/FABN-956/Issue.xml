CDATA Currently node-sdk log output looks like this {code} {"level":"debug","message":" Remote.js : Successfully connected to remote gRPC server","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.704Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" Orderer.js : sendBroadcast - sent message","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.705Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" Orderer.js : sendBroadcast - on data response: {\"status\":\"SUCCESS\",\"info\":\"\"}","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.710Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" Orderer.js : sendBroadcast - response status SUCCESS","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.711Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" BasicCommitHandler : _commit - Successfully sent transaction to the orderer orderer.example.com","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.711Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" Orderer.js : sendBroadcast - on end:","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:14.712Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" ChannelEventHub.js : on.data - event stream:1 _current_stream:1  peer:localhost:7051","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:16.784Z"} {"level":"debug","message":" ChannelEventHub.js : isStreamReady - stream.readable true :: localhost:7051","timestamp":"2018-10-04T12:21:16.784Z"} {code} Which would be ok if this was to be passed to some tools to process, but for human readability it's not great. In the first instance I think we need a log output that is more useful for initial readability which means that it puts data into fixed column width such as log level, timestamp, class, but more importantly timestamp is the first column, not the last.  ></description> </Issue>

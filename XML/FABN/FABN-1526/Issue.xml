CDATA *As an* application developer *I want* to navigate to either Node SDK v2.0 or v1.4 documentation *So that* I can find documentation on developing client application using either SDK version without requiring any pointers from others  Note that in v1.4 fabric-network is the preferred API while in v2.0 it is the only application client API, with fabric-client removed and fabric-common considered primarily an implementation detail. The capabilities of the two SDK versions is also slightly different, with CLI commands being the tool for admin operations in v2.0 The documentation structure should reflect this by presenting appropriate information at the top level of the documentation for each version.  ></description> </Issue>

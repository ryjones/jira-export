CDATA Fabric node SDK not updating eventer list if all peers stopped or if new peers started  Fabric node SDK only adding the connected peers for the client organization in eventer list and it will not update it if there are another peers are connected   I have 3 peers for org2 ( peer0 , peer1 , peer2 )    If I closed any peer before connecting to the gateway ( eg Peer0 ) , client will create new eventer for peer1 and peer2 and start listening for one of them, also it will log the below line   `set current eventer Eventer- name: peer1.org2.example.com:8151, url:grpcs://localhost:8151, connected:true, connectAttempted:true`  then If I started peer0 the eventer list will not be updated !! , and after closing peer1 it will start listening for peer2 events if peer2 stopped it will not start listening to peer0 and log the below lines :   event registrations 0 clear out the listener list no current eventer - not shutting down stream   Also if peer1 and peer2 started neither block events nor contract events  will be published !! , Java SDK can update eventer even if all peers for this org are stopped I can listen to the events from the external peers   ></description> </Issue>

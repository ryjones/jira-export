CDATA In the SDK can we:  1. add descriptions for every parameter 2. have more samples  3. Not have to force the user to do a make to get the docs: This issue is previously raised here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2196.  Copied from FAB-220: The task is to: 1) Investigate other tools other than typedoc to generate documentation from typescript source. 2) If a better tool is not found, investigate how to better use typedoc. Are there other options we should use other than what makedoc.sh currently specifies?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Background (Rocket.Chat): 8/4/2017 Chris Ferris: I think that we should use a consistent approach for our documentation. That means for fabric using RST and RTD for tutorials and other prose, and linking to language specific API documentation (jsdoc, javadoc, godoc, etc) from that I don't think that we should be using a different scheme because we will soon be translating and we cannot be all over the map with how we deliver docs so that the translation process can be consistently applied across projects and also so that the release process is consistent this also makes it easier for people to engage in helping to write the documentation without having to use different skills/tools across the various repos  Jim Zhang: ok that makes sense, we have one prose (intro page) and one tutorial so far (creating channel), both specific to node.js SDK, that we can move out of jsdoc into RST/RTD, we should move them out of fabric-sdk-node and into fabric/docs  ></description> </Issue>

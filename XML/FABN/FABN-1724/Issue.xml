CDATA currently there are two of Identity provider supported by fabric node sdk . # Simple X509Identity #  HSMX509Identity  Apart from them custom identity can be implemented by simply implementing `IdentityProvider` interface (exported by fabric-network pkg).   So, I am trying to implement a custom identity provided by `Vault Transit Engine` and HSM via PKCS#11 Proxy. But `sign(key: ICryptoKey, digest: Buffer): Buffer;` function of *`*ICryptoSuite*`* is a synchronous function . I think it should a asynchronous function so that other kind of identity provider can easily be implemented.     I can think of two solution  # Change `ICryptoSuite`  interface to support asynchronous sign function , but this approach will require me to read the fabric-common pkg and change so code there. # Devise a way to convert a synchronous to asynchronous call, (but this definitely not good idea)  Is there any better approach to this problem ? please share  ></description> </Issue>

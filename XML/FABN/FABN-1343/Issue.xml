CDATA Document the pattern for apps to consume and process block events, e.g. to build an off chain data store.  The node.js SDK low level event tutorial mentions the pattern here:  https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/tutorial-channel-events.html:   "For example an application could listen for block events and write transaction data to a data store for the purpose of performing queries or other analytics against the channel's data..."  The more comprehensive text needs to be merged into the high level event tutorial as well:   https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/tutorial-listening-to-events.html   It should also point to the sample here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/off_chain_data   Â   ></description> </Issue>

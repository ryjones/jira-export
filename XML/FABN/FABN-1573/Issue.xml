CDATA Scenario tests install the same (Fabcar) chaincode in several different channels using the same label during the *lifecycle chaincode install* step. Fabric now generates an error if an identical chaincode package (based on hash of the package) with the same label has previously been installed. This breaks the existing scenatio tests in theÂ _master_ branch.  The chaincode install steps need to be changed to avoid the error described above. The simplest change is probably to include the channel name in the chaincode package label so different tests can install chaincode on the channel they are using without conflicting with identical chaincode packages that may previously have been installed for other channels.  ></description> </Issue>

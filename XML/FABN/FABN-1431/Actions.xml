CDATA I think the issue is 1.4.4 is the "latest" version and has the old news:   https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-network    https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabric-common   (click the "versions" tab)  this change should fix it: commit 54cc00f29dc9d0a7b5460490a0ebb81308ef84b9 (HEAD) Author: heatherlp <40789053+heatherlp@users.noreply.github.com> Date:   Fri Nov 29 14:18:26 2019 +0000  (Release-1.4) Remove gerrit/jenkins references (#49)  Signed-off-by: heatherlp <heatherpollard0@gmail.com>  but it is quite a few changes after the 1.4.4 tag, which points here: commit 5491a53b647a378aa0cfbffb5539f567e2850156 Merge: bb2d9aeb 5cda9597 Author: Andrew Coleman <andrew_coleman@uk.ibm.com> Date:   Mon Jul 1 10:23:14 2019 +0000  Merge " FABN-1251  Added start/end block functionality" into release-1.4  I suspect adding a 1.4.5 tag and shipping that as "latest" would fix it  ></body> </Action>

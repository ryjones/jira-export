CDATA The CoreAPI.md document currently doesn't contain comprehensive REST request/response examples for all the endpoints. The required examples already exist within the fabric protocol-spec.md document in section "6.2 REST API".  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/protocol-spec.md  It would be beneficial to rework CoreAPI.md doc to make these examples more accessible for our users.  This issue was originally tracked in GitHub here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/1638  ></description> </Issue>

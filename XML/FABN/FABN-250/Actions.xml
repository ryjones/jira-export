CDATA Talked to  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  , he doesn't think we can control this since the dependency is pulled in by another dependency that we don't have control over. It may have to be documented in release notes that user should update the package after npm install.  Bret, assuming we go with the release notes approach, you could go ahead and add a couple sentences now to fabric-sdk-node release_notes/v1.1.0-rc1.txt. You can see the release note precedent in : https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17197/ .   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sambhavdutt , this bug does not duplicate FAB-10039. It only reports vulnerability for hoek@2.16.3 package, but FAB-10039 reports vulnerabilities for more packages.   As said in previous comments, we don't control hoek version because the dependency is pulled in by another package that we don't have control over. For v1.2, I think we will go with the same release note approach as v1.1.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com ,  ~denyeart     The hoek@2.16.3 package is pulled in due to log4js@2.7.0 that is ONLY used in node sdk unit tests. The sdk itself (fabric-client) pulls in hoek@4.2.1 that has no vulnerability.   Unless we need to document vulnerability for sdk unit tests, I suggest we close this ticket.     ></body> </Action>

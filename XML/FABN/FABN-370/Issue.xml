CDATA the nonce should ideally be automatically generated instead of being required on the API. the reason this is required, from discussing with  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  is the nonce and txId must be coherent: txId = hash(nonce + creator.IdBytes)  a possible solution to this, so that we don't ask the application developer for having to generate the nonce and the txId while preserving the coherence b/w the txId and the nonce values on APIs, is to use a "TransactionID" class that gets instantiated with the creator IdBytes and generates the nonce internally as well as the txId.  so the application code would look like: Client.newTransactionID() <<== this requires the Client to have a legit userContext already   ></description> </Issue>

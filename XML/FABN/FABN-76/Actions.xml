CDATA My plan would to enhance the current parser where the path attribute may be an url. Not sure that this type of change would require a new parser altogether and a new version on the file itself.   Also please note that is not a priority item and I do not know when I would get to it. If you have time, you may contribute to the open source project.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  noted.  I'll experiment it on my fork version  https://github.com/paulwizviz/fabric-sdk-node . Feel free to follow it.  I normally do it via a BDD style unit/smoke tests you can see here  https://github.com/paulwizviz/fabric-sdk-node/tree/release-1.1/test/bdd|https://github.com/paulwizviz/fabric-sdk-node/tree/release-1.1/test/bdd.  (this is only on my forked repo and won't be pushed to the hyperledger repo).  Anyway if I reach any point that I think maybe useful, I'll let you know. If you think I have made headway, I'll cherry-pick the changes to the main repo and you can advise me on how to then push to the hyperledger repo for contribution.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  called chain.setDeployWaitTime() to set the wait time to various values: 0, 6000, -1. The sdk accepted these values. A value of 6000 (seconds) is acceptable I suppose but the meanings of 0 and -1 are not described in the documentation.  I then called chain.setDeployWaitTime("as long as it takes") in the test case ...sdk/node/test/unit/chain-test.js "Deploy a chaincode by enrolled user".  "as long as it takes" is not a number as required in the documentation: setDeployWaitTime(secs: number): void  and yet the call succeeded. Not only did the call succeed, the value did not impact the deploy: # Deploy a chaincode by enrolled user setting bogus wait time prior to deploy deploy results: {"uuid":"mycc1","chaincodeID":"mycc1","result":"TODO: get actual results; waited as long as it takes seconds and assumed deploy was successful"}  Here it is again using -1 as the value:  # Deploy a chaincode by enrolled user setting bogus wait time prior to deploy deploy results: {"uuid":"mycc1","chaincodeID":"mycc1","result":"T ODO: get actual results; waited -1 seconds and assumed deploy was successful"} Describe How to Reproduce  In vagrant, 1.Edit fabric/sdk/node/test/unit/chain-tests.js 2.Add this call before a valid deploy: chain.setDeployWaitTime("as long as it takes") 3.Run 'make node-sdk-unit-tests'.   ></description> </Issue>

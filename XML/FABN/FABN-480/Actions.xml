CDATA Without validation of the number of seconds entered, the code works as described in the Node.js doc: https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_arg When delay is larger than 2147483647(ms) or less than 1, the delay will be set to 1.  I could not find any functions that validated input, except those with error callbacks.  So my assumption is that as long as an unexpected exception does not occur with any kind of input and the setTimeout function actually works, this function is working as designed.  Will check to see if we should add to the doc to indicate the Node.js defaults that are used when a value is entered outside of it's lower and upper limits.    ></body> </Action>

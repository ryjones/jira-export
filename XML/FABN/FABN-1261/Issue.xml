CDATA using Node SDK and fabric v 1.4.1.  When service discovery is active  and runs it assigns its own names to the peers consisting on hostname:port, when you use a configuration file  and you are not working in localhost and do an invoke request from the sdk when it tries the endorsing it fails because the names assigned by discovery dont map to the host ips.

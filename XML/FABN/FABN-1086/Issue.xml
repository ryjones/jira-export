CDATA With the increase in unit test coverage, we have opened the ability to remove e2e tests without dropping code coverage. This needs to be addressed as we need to be able to safeguard against the accidental disabling of tests with an errant `.only` being left in and missed by a reviewer.  The most effective way to achieve this would be to run the unit tests separately to the e2e/cucumber tests, with code coverage limits set for each.  ></description> </Issue>

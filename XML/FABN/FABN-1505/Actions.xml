CDATA Hey  ~jfilippone  if I update the fabric-ca-client package.json and the other sdk-node packages to depend on a version of winston at 2.x, I think this help solve your problem. But will you still see issues with the fact fabric-ca-client with use an older winston version, than compared with your application using winston 3.2.1?  I might be missing some fundamental understanding of how loggers work here :)  ></body> </Action>

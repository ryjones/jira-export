CDATA {noformat} eventHandlerOptions: { commitTimeout: 300, // 5 minutes strategy: EventStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX }, eventHubSelectionOptions: { strategy: EventHubSelectionStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ROUND_ROBIN, } {noformat}  Event hub management has 2 configurable strategies and the above are the default ones. However If I change the eventHandlerOptions strategy to use NETWORK level scope rather than MSPID scope then it won't include any event hubs from other orgs due to the eventHubSelection strategy, unfortunately this is a regression. I think we need the following  1. There needs to be more inbuilt event hub selection strategies to allow for at least a working environment when any of the inbuilt event handler options are selected  2. Fabric-Network should change the default eventHubSelection strategy to a more appropriate one if the eventHandlerOptions is changed to another built in strategy and eventhubselection is not specified in order to maintain backward compatibility.   3. validation should be done to ensure that the combination of user selected inbuilt strategies will work together as expected and throw an error if they don't  ></description> </Issue>

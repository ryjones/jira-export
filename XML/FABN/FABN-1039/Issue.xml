CDATA This is for the fabric-client, fabric-ca-client, and fabric-network packages.  - The build should fail if `npm audit` finds any vulnerabilities  - We should check in the package-lock.json file as per the official guidance from npm:  https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks#using-locked-packages > It is highly recommended you commit the generated package lock to source control: this will allow anyone else on your team, your deployments, your CI/continuous integration, and anyone else who runs npm install in your package source to get the exact same dependency tree that you were developing on. Additionally, the diffs from these changes are human-readable and will inform you of any changes npm has made to your node_modules, so you can notice if any transitive dependencies were updated, hoisted, etc.  This will stop us being taken out by breaking downstream package changes such as the recent changes to the sinon module.  - We should run `npm shrinkwrap` before publishing the code.  ></description> </Issue>

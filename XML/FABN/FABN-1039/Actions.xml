CDATA This PR got rid of a lot of the dependency issues:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/commit/6e398bcfee72da097e7a6142351de59ea0cbafbd   Remaining stuff I need to do before I can close this out: - 4 vulnerabilities on the master branch left to fix - enable npm install and shrinkwrap in the builds - check that locally installing each module doesn't result in npm audit failures - do all of the above for the 1.4 branch (if we think it's applicable) currently 55 hits when I run npm audit on the 1.4 branch  Links I want to keep reference to:  https://npm.community/t/npm-update-crashes-at-depth-20/10733    https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#depth   https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/239   https://npm.community/t/npm-update-depth-command-no-longer-working-correctly-v6-9-0/7571/8  https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19721   https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities |https://npm.community/t/npm-update-depth-command-no-longer-working-correctly-v6-9-0/7571/8   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I can't fix the 4 remaining vulnerabilities automatically or with npm audit/recommended commands:  1. Bug for npm audit claiming to have fixed them, but not:  https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/301  2. Bug for npm update not doing anything:  https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/394   ></body> </Action>

CDATA - I am porting the four commits delivered under this work into release-1.4, starting today. I'll use this issue to track that porting, and I'll close this issue when that's done - I can't enable npm audit in the builds due to a fabric-client dependency problem, so I've separated out that work here: FABN-1462  ></body> </Action>

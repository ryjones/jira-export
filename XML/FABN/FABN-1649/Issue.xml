CDATA All of the v1.4 npm packages are published to with the *latest-1.4* tag; distinct from the v2.2 npm packages, which are published with the *latest* tag. However, there is no v2.2 release of the _fabric-client_ package, which has left the *latest* tag orphaned at a back-level version.  To avoid confusion, the v1.4 _fabric-client_ package should be tagged as both *latest-1.4* and *latest*.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently the node-sdk depends on grpc-node, which is being deprecated and replaced by grpc-js.  In conjunction, node-sdk currently depends on protobufjs 5, which needs to be converted to protobufjs 6, in order to support grpc-js.  Will be done in master branch to begin with, unsure about release-1.4  So, current work breakdown is: * convert from protobufjs 5 to 6 * convert from grpc-node to grpc-js    Need to think about whether this can be classed as a breaking change, or whether this can go into a 2.1.x release  ></description> </Issue>

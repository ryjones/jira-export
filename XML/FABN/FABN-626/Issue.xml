CDATA pkcs11 is not going to be used by many users of the node-sdk. however for all users it is installed and given it is native code requires compilation, not so much of a problem for linux, a bit of a pain for Mac users having to have xcode but a big pain for windows users.  npm supports the concept of optionalDependencies but depending on how pkcs11 is required in the code base it may have to be changed to require it only when needed (specified).  This literally might be a simple change to package.json of moving it to an optionalDependencies property in the package.json  ></description> </Issue>

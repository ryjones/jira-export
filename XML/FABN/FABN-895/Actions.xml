CDATA  ~arman19940326  There are several solutions for the client signing, which one is better depends on your business scenarios. # Thinking about the banking systemï¼Œusually there are some hardware USB devices to do the signing. And some drivers for the device is required at client side. # Another common way is using a software wallet to do this. There are a lot of software wallets for the crypto currency. We may benefits from these implementations. # Using a cloud based private key management system is also a good choice. However extra work should be made to ensure a safe communication (https, mutual TLS, etc) between the client (browser, cellphone, PAD, etc) and cloud crypto suite.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~zhaochy , I wanted to contact you over rocketchat, but I was not clear on your handle. I figured this would be good enough. :)  This epic needs a test plan added to the epic. The test plan should include functional and system test cases that you expect to be executed for this epic. The functional test case ideas should include negative test cases as well as happy path cases. Any system test (performance, concurrency, load...) expectations that should be executed with this epic should also be noted. Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

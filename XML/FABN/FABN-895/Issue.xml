CDATA As a (node) sdk user, I want to keep my private key safe, and use my private key offline.  In most use case, fabric-sdk-node will be used at the server side. However, the current design of node sdk requires the user's private key to sign transaction. SDK should provide possibility so that user can keep their private key somewhere else, and no private key is needed at SDK side.  ></description> </Issue>

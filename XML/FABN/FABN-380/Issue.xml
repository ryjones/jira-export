CDATA channel initialize used to get the channel config from the orderer, however it was changed by FAB-8569 to retrieve the information from the peer. Unfortunately this change hardcoded it to the peer in the list of peers in the channel that are ledger query peers. If that peer is down but other peers are up, a client of the node-sdk is unable to initialize the channel object in order to interact with the channel and there is no way for the client to handle this scenario (for example tell initialize to try a different peer).  There are workarounds to being able to manage which peer the comms is with, neither are ideal 1. Each client will have to re-implement initialize as it really makes 2 calls to setup the channel object - getChannelConfig - loadConfigEnvelop But this is not good as it is an internal requirement for the channel object setup 2. Alter the order of peers returned by the channel.getPeers call   Node-sdk should allow for target selection on the initialize of a channel object.  ></description> </Issue>

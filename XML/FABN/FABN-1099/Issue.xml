CDATA `instantiate policy` is not `endorsemnet policy`, it is used during chaincode packaging/install determining who is able to instantiate/upgrade chaincode, it is partially supported in nodejs with chaincode package binary(byte  ) as input.  quoted from Dave Enyeart:   "They are different, instantiate policy gets packaged with a chaincode and specifies who can instantiate the chaincode,  see the doc starting at: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4noah.html#packaging"  It is a historical missing feature of FABN. we should add policy params to all chaincode packager implements.  ></description> </Issue>

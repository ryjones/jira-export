CDATA The engines.node properties are only advisory, no mandatory. we shouldn't use that to indicate the supported engine ranges. in addition, engine-strict and engineStrict properties have been removed from npm support already since 3.0.0.  in addition, we want to introduce support for node 8, in addition to 6 (until 6 goes end of life). as far as I know it's not possible to list discrete version ranges (skipping 7.x in b/w) with semver. so the next best solution is to just remove the ranges altogether.  note that we need to update the docs to reflect this.  ></description> </Issue>

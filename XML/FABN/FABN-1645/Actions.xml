CDATA  ~yacovm  does the peer discovery service know if the chaincode is installed on the local or remote peer ? Are the chaincodes listed in the state_info of the peer membership results only those that are installed ?  If that is how it works then we could add this info to the peers so that the high level query handlers can ask the channel instance for peers with mspid and also chaincode.  ></body> </Action>

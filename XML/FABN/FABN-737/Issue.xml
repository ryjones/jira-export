CDATA based on discussions on slack with  ~muralisr   ~mastersingh24   ~pmullaney , transactions IDs are best set by the SDK in order to make the transaction processing idempotent. With this design, the client app, in browsers or native app or mobile app, holds the complete state information needed in case of backend failure that puts the system in an unknown state. The client can choose to re-submit the transaction with the existing Tx ID.  For this to work the endorser and the committer must always check if the Tx ID has already been committed to the ledger previously.  the SDK API should be designed such that there's a separate call to obtain the Tx ID, then use it in the construction of proposals and transactions. The separate API to obtain just the Tx ID is important because it allows the client tier to possess that BEFORE the transaction is submitted, which is a key part of an idempotent transaction submission design.  To generation a unique txID, the Zurich crypto team recommended hashing "creator" concatenated with the "nonce" value for the proposal.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Node.js 8.4.x is in the "current" mode, which is leading up to the Long-Term Support (LTS) mode some time in October.  for 1.1 we'd like to introduce node 8 support in addition to node 6.9+  In order to do this (dual support for node 6 and 8), we'd like to ask for a new CI to be created that will run the entire test bucket ('gulp test') with node 8.4.x, in addition to the current job that uses node 6.9.x  While this may not be a huge deal for majority of the community at this point, this will make a huge difference for those who would like to take up node.js chaincode, which is only supported on node 8.4.0+. It would be a big headache (and honestly an irresponsible thing to do) to require them to write client-side code with node.js SDK for node.js 6.9 levels and write chaincode for node 8 levels.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I compared the unit-test coverage in event-tests.js to the EventHub methods,  as listed in the generated documentation.  Certain calls are not covered: connect(), disconnect(), isConnected(), setPeerAddr(),  un registerTxEvent(),   Upon study and discussion, it so happens certain methods such as  un registerTxEventt() are not meant to be used by the nodejs client.   They support other event hub calls.   None of this is mentioned in the generated documentation.     (1) Could we have information  for certain methods in the generated documentation?  Here are some ideas to get started:  -  Restriction:  Nodejs clients do not invoke this method directly.  The SDK invokes it as needed.  -  Tip:  A nodejs client does not invoke this function directly.  It is used internally by the nodejs SDK.  -  Tip:  Most Nodejs clients can use EventHub{Connect|Disconnect  instead of this method.  The advantage of calling EventHub{Connect|Disconnect  is <provide advantage> -  Tip:  Most nodejs clients can ignore this function.  It is only needed when <provide reason>    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The channel events documentation seems to be largely copied from the standard eventhub documentation.  The whole thing could use some review, but one notable piece that jumps out is:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/767598e3c7490305dd60c634543f0bbcd7f1fd25/fabric-client/lib/ChannelEventHub.js#L90-L91  {noformat} * The events are ephemeral, such that if a registered listener * crashed when the event is published, the listener will miss the event. {noformat}  This is patently wrong, and one of the biggest shortcomings of the old eventhub that led to its deprecation.  More correctly, events are tied to block number.  If the client tracks the last block number processed for a channel, they may simply resume event processing from this block at startup to ensure no events are missed.  Although this is a doc defect, there seems to be considerable confusion around how to appropriately receive and consume events from Fabric so I see this as rather important for us to get right.  ></description> </Issue>

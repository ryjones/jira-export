CDATA  ~jyellick  Is the text which follows those statements still correct or does that need to be addressed as well. ? ``` |There are several techniques to compensate for missed events due to client crashes:|  | 1) register block event listeners and record the block numbers received, such that|  | * when the next block arrives and its number is not the next in sequence, then|  | * the application knows exactly which block events have been missed. It can then use|  | *  queryBlock {@link Channel#queryBlock} to get those missed blocks from the target peer or|  | * register for events using the startBlock option to resume or replay the events. You may|  | * also include an endBlock number if you wish to stop listening.|  | 2) use a message queue to catch all the block events. With many robust message queue|  | * implementations available today, you will be guaranteed to not miss an event. A|  | * fabric event listener can be written in any programming language. The following|  | * implementations can be used as reference to write the necessary glue code between|  * the fabric event stream and a message queue:```  ></body> </Action>

The text should also be updated to discuss the options for beginning (and ending) event delivery.  By default, the most recently committed block is the start point, but if the user knows the last block processed, it may specify it.  There are also options to explicitly start from the oldest or newest block.  I believe in v1.3 there may additionally be options for what block to end at (the underlying service API supports this, I do not know if the node SDK does)." created="2018-09-06 18:05:01.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2018-09-06 18:05:01.0"/>

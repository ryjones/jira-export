CDATA Create and implement a test plan for the node-sdk -custom event plug-in- +chaincode event support. + 'Custom events' is synonymous with chaincode events.  Using the term plug-in is misleading.   Here is a chat concerning nomenclature.   pmullaney  1:11 PM    right   1:13    plug-in implies that you need a special piece of software loaded for something to work  jjjjibm  1:13 PM    yes, and I wasn't seeing that   1:13    maybe it was a plug-in at one time :slightly_smiling_face:  new messages pmullaney  1:13 PM    so thats not the case, chaincode events has support in the sdk and on the fabric side by default  ></description> </Issue>

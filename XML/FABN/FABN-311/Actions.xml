CDATA 'Custom events' is synonymous with chaincode events. Using the term plug-in is misleading. Here is a chat concerning nomenclature.  pmullaney  1:11 PM   right   1:13   plug-in implies that you need a special piece of software loaded for something to work  jjjjibm  1:13 PM   yes, and I wasn't seeing that   1:13   maybe it was a plug-in at one time :slightly_smiling_face:  new messages pmullaney  1:13 PM   so thats not the case, chaincode events has support in the sdk and on the fabric side by default   ></body> </Action>

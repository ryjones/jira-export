CDATA Allan Tomkinson (@atom on Slack) has kindly reported a set of issues encountered when trying to build HFC on Windows 10. From issues that seemingly stem from different Python versions (2.7 and no 3.0), some required the Windows 8.1 SDK, and some other suspected versioning conflict that made him use Visual Studio 2013, rather than the 2015 that he had previously configured.  Noting that Allan also tried doing these with windows-build-tools already installed (which was supposed to help with installing the pre-reqs).  Will also append the original exchange/report, for completeness.  ></description> </Issue>

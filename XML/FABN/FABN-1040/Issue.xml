CDATA as of `fabric-network@1.3.0-snapshot.28` the npm publish script would update the fabric-network\package.json to add two lines under "dependencies" {color:#9cdcfe}"dependencies"{color}{color:#d4d4d4}: {{color} {color:#9cdcfe}"fabric-ca-client"{color}{color:#d4d4d4}: {color}{color:#ce9178}"1.3.0-snapshot.60"{color}{color:#d4d4d4},{color} {color:#9cdcfe}"fabric-client"{color}{color:#d4d4d4}: {color}{color:#ce9178}"1.3.0-snapshot.59"{color}     The dependencies were removed with  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-922   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26340/      If we need the dependencies add back I would suggest that we use a tag rather than a specific version, like for master use "unstable", for release-1.3 use "unstable-1.3" and when publishing releases or betas use "latest", "latest-1.3", "beta', all of which will be in the $CURRENT_TAG value so no actual logic will be required, the tag is has already been set is correct for publish.  ></description> </Issue>

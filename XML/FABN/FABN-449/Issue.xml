CDATA While investigating another problem, this JIRA came up https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5476  which dictates that if 2 peers have the same chaincode installed then the path provided during install must be identical. The Node SDK packager uses the request.chaincodePath to package the node.js chaincode and it needs to be an absolute path for it to work. This means that if one person installs the chaincode on Peer 1 but a different person installs the chaincode on Peer 2, unless they are using identical directory structures for where the chaincode is stored, then we will hit the problem described in the above jira.  It should be possible to install the chaincode on different peers from different systems without restriction.  ></description> </Issue>

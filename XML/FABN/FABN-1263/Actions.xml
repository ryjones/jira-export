<Action id="63874" issue="40357" author="davidkel" type="comment" body="This is due to mismatch of libcrypto versions in the ssl package. softhsm is using 1 version and node uses another. softhsm should be compiled to use the headers from the version of node being used and explicitly NOT link to libcrypto (ie no -lcrypto) when it is built. This will ensure that when softhsm2 library is loaded into the node address space that they correctly use the same version of crypto capabilities and them the HSM tests will pass." created="2019-09-19 12:56:36.0" updateauthor="davidkel" updated="2019-09-19 12:56:36.0"/>

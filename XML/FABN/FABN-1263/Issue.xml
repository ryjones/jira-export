CDATA To be able to support node 10 for the node sdk 1.4 there needs to be a clean build of the 1.4 branch. The only build to run under Node 10.15.3 is a daily build, but this is constantly failing when it attempts to perform the first HSM test through the fabric-network tests.  {noformat} 23:31:40 ok 484 Successfully instantiated chaincode on the channel 23:31:40 #  23:31:40  23:31:40 ****** Network End-to-end flow: import identity into wallet using hsm ***** 23:31:40  23:31:40 /tmp/jenkins5334209965162965844.sh: line 119: 24892 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) gulp run-end-to-end 23:31:40 --------> ERROR!!! gulp end-2-end tests failed for node 10.15.3 <--------- 23:31:40 Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure {noformat}  This has been seen more than once but the builds are not kept long enough so not worth putting a build link in. But they all fail with a segmentation fault.  Because this breaks the build is also not possible to confirm if non HSM tests that may run subsequently pass either.  ></description> </Issue>

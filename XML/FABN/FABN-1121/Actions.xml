CDATA Going forward, development focus is on the higher level (fabric-network) API. It seems that if it is important to track the processing of transactions events within a given numbered block event, this can be achieved by attaching a block listener and iterating over the transactions events within that block event. The checkpointing capability in the higher level API also provides a mechanism for this tracking.  If there is something missing from the higher level API capability, or an area where the usability needs to be improved to help end users, please reopen with details.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The height is represented as a tuple <blockNum, txNum> where the txNum is the position of the transaction (starting with 0) within block.  The txNum should be available on tx events.     Apps need the block height for a variety of reasons.  One reason is for BCDR and being able to rollback their databases to match the blockchain.     As a workaround, an additional query to blockchain will be performed for the tx events received to retrieve the block height from the transaction data  https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/global.html#Transaction__anchor         ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hello,  When following the FabCar tutorial here  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html  I got this stack when doing "npm install": {code:java} npm ERR! pkcs11js@1.0.13 install: `node-gyp rebuild` npm ERR! Exit status 1 npm ERR! npm ERR! Failed at the pkcs11js@1.0.13 install script 'node-gyp rebuild'. npm ERR! Make sure you have the latest version of node.js and npm installed. npm ERR! If you do, this is most likely a problem with the pkcs11js package, npm ERR! not with npm itself. npm ERR! Tell the author that this fails on your system: npm ERR!     node-gyp rebuild npm ERR! You can get information on how to open an issue for this project with: npm ERR!     npm bugs pkcs11js npm ERR! Or if that isn't available, you can get their info via: npm ERR!     npm owner ls pkcs11js npm ERR! There is likely additional logging output above.  npm ERR! Please include the following file with any support request: npm ERR!     /workspace/others/hl_fabric/fabric-samples/fabcar/npm-debug.log npm ERR! code 1{code} I had to manually follow this steps to make it works (maybe some are optionals): * npm install -g node-gyp * npm config set python /usr/bin/python * yum install gcc-c++     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The current tape framework being used as an FV test harness is proving to be unreliable, difficult to debug and obscured.  A new framework that is more reliable and enables more explicit tests to be written is required. The proposal is: * Create a script that deploys a fabric network and then initiates a mocha based test framework * Add new tests to this framework and stop using tape * When a tape test fails, port it to the new framework * Migrate tape tests to the new framework over time  This task covers only the first bullet point.  ></description> </Issue>

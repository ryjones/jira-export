CDATA The Common Connection Profile already has a section that can be used to define HSM, however it would require a "slot" property unless the HSM implementation changes as it uses slot numbers rather than labels. I also think the priority of this should be targeted for 1.1 as the definition exists. As a further consideration, the library property should support environment variable substitution to ensure the profile can remain portable. It would be nice to support labels in the node-sdk, that would make it consistent with fabric and also get around the annoyance of softhsm 2.2 changing the slot number when you create the HSM to some random number which you have to then capture and use. Will this change make it into the 1.1 release ?  ></body> </Action>

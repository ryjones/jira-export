CDATA Hi  ~Matrixik , I've modified the fabcar sample and attached to this Jira.  It creates a new car, queries it, modifies the owner and queries it again.  The output I see is:    {code:java} createCar has been submitted Transaction has been evaluated, result is: {"make":"Honda","model":"Accord","colour":"Black","owner":"Tom"} changeCarOwner has been submitted Transaction has been evaluated, result is: {"make":"Honda","model":"Accord","colour":"Black","owner":"Dave"} {code} which indicates that it is waiting for the commit before moving on.  Without seeing your code, it's difficult to diagnose your observations.   Please can you check that you are using `await` when submitting the transaction?  Failing that, please can you run the attached code against the fabcar network and let us know the results?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA You was right with not using `await` properly. I was using `await contract.submitTransaction` to send every transaction but this code was enclosed in two different functions and I was calling this functions without `await` before them :facepalm: ... That what you get for starting writing in completely new language.     Thank you for help and sorry for wasting your time. At least in the process I found bug in the docs and fixed it (PR #271) :)  ></body> </Action>

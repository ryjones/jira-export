CDATA FAB-5805 introduced a change in the way the SDK loads config files.  Due to the way multiple tests load the fabric-client and due to the fact that the config is somewhat global, this results in the GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES environment variable not being set properly.Â  This is most evident running test/integration/e2e.js and this is causing the e2e tests for Fabric to fail  ></description> </Issue>

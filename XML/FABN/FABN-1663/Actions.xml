CDATA transaction.submits have never worked when using system chaincodes and discovery due to discovery not returning an endorsement plan.  Should we force users to specify the peers when they submit transactions or should the SDK create an endorsement plan for system chaincodes since discovery will not. The user has turned on discovery for a reason and we should attempt to help them.  If we were to create a plan, I am thinking that it should be select one peer from every organization (mspid) found using the 'local' discovery query as the source.    ></body> </Action>

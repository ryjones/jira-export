In my case the problem was TLS handshake between nodejs app and peer failed, and indeed in the connection profile the protocol set was grpc instead of grpcs.  After changing the url from grpc to grpcs, the "Stream removed" problem disappeared but was replaced by another one (which I describe here  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525230/grpc-communication-fails-between-nodejs-app-and-peer)  so I'm not sure if switching to grpcs really fixed the issue.  ></body> </Action>

The same problem here. I am running stress tests running Fabric in IBP v2 with two worker nodes. After 20 minutes of testing, first I got the "2 UNKNOWN: Stream removed" error message. After this error, I received repeatedly the error "Failed to connect before the deadline URL:grpcs:/..." for almost a minute.     ></body> </Action>

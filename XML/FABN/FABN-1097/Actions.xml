CDATA Dear Bret, LOL, I guess I am the one who in favor of using "instanceof" syntax.  It will have a clear expression and more strict type check. But for sdk-node, it is a big problem because we have duplicated "User", "Client" class  in fabric-client and fabric-ca-client. That is also why fabric-common is needed and proposed.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The FileKeyValueStore implementation follows the convention that when a relative path is passed in, it's relative to where the node process is running (which is different than what "__dirname" points to). the headless-tests.js has a couple of test cases around this area that didn't follow this same convention. they should be updated.  as a side-effect, you should be able to run the headless-test.js from any directory.   ></description> </Issue>

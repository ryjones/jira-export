For an empty `  ` object, the `for (i in   )` returns the `function` for the new method. However, adding new methods to array&apos;s is a fairly common practice and shouldn&apos;t result in the SDK from breaking." created="2018-01-13 11:49:08.0" updateauthor="sudheesh001" updated="2018-01-13 11:49:08.0"/>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24  You can replicate the same issue with the sample code itself available on hyperledger by running this controller. The only change is add the following piece of code in the file  Array.prototype.mymethod = function(array) \{ // Do anything }  And then run this part of the controller.  https://github.com/hyperledger/education/blob/master/LFS171x/fabric-material/tuna-app/controller.js#L87-L245  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I was unable to fix this kind of issue by adding checks to the places where we are working with an Array object as it then failed in dependent packages.   Is this a common thing in Javascript to change the base objects ? I do not see how we can be expected to protect the SDK code from applications that wish to change how the actual language works.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *As an* application developer *I want* to use the latest long-term support Node version *So that* I can take advantage of new features and a longer platform support window  Node 12 entered LTS in the second half of 2019. Builds and tests should be run against this Node version, and this should be the (or a) supported version for the v2.0 release of the SDK.  An option is to continue running builds and tests on Node 10 in addition to Node 12, and declare support for both versions.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Using the File Checkpointer, the last block processed recorded by the checkpointer is replayed on start up even though it was already marked as processed. This situation happens **only** when the listener doesn't have any events to catch up on (i.e. no events came through while the event listener was down). Also, this situation is **exclusive** to the block event listener (i.e. we do not see this issue when using the chaincode event listener).  Â   This is seen in fabric-network 1.4.6, but Jira only has v1.4.4 as the latest released version  ></description> </Issue>

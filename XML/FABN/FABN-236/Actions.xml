<Action id="23391" issue="15649" author="jimthematrix" type="comment" body="need more details on how this was reproduced. note that there is no good indicator that the channel has been successfully created by the orderer. so you have to wait some length of time before calling join channel. that&apos;s what the e2e.js test does, waiting 5 seconds. it&apos;s not pretty but is the easiest solution. you could also keep polling until you get the expected block (within a set timeout)" created="2017-05-04 20:08:54.0" updateauthor="jimthematrix" updated="2017-05-04 20:08:54.0"/>

CDATA hi guys, i am running into the same problem.  running on Ubuntu 16.4.2 64bit, following Marbles v3.0 manual from  here|https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/blob/v3.0/docs/install_chaincode_locally.md  i have ran the docker-composer: _docker-compose -f docker-compose-marblesv3.yaml up -d_ all the network is up and running, verified by _docker ps_  then moved to marbles directory, installed successfully all packages with _npm install_ then went to ./scripts directory, and ran  _node install_chaincode.js_ it went successfully, so I ran  _node instantiate_chaincode.js_ and this is where I have received the same output after tracing the error, I could figure out that it happens in deploj_cc.js line 141: _chain.initialize().then ..._ which calls _chain.js -> orderer.js_ : sendDeliver.on('data'... it returns status 'NOT_FOUND'     hope that helps     ></body> </Action>

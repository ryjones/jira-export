CDATA my guess would be that as of https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8905/ the tests are using a different Crypto Key Store that the CryptoSuite uses to save private keys. but the s390 environment from my understanding is not cleaning up the state store that saves the user objects. the existing user objects in the state store has the SKI pointing to the private keys in the old key store, but they don't exist in the new private key store.  the fix is to manually delete the state stores in the s390 environment: /tmp/hfc-test-*  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Unlike block event listeners and chaincode event listeners. A commit listener could only be listening for a single event So once the event has been received. Then that listener is redundant. There is no guidance on what an application should do in this event so a natural assumption would be that it cleans itself up so the application is at liberty to add another commit listener for a specific transaction id. This is likely to cause a leak as the commit listeners are not cleaned up.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fabric node SDK will not retry to reconnect to the offline peers like java SDK   If all peers which included in connection profile are stopped and try to open the client and connect to the network, it will throw the below errors :   `Error: Failed to connect before the deadline on Discoverer- name:` `waitForReady - Failed to connect to remote gRPC server:` `Error: DiscoveryService has failed to return results:`  then the client will not try to reconnect same as java , java will try to reconnect till the peer starts and log the below line :   `channel: mychannel, peerName: peer0.org2.example.com, url: grpcs://localhost:8051}, *attempts 2301*. UNAVAILABLE: io exception`    also node will not retrieve the network object ( from calling gateway.connect() )  and of-course I can't get contract object and listen to blocks and contracts events , however java will do that !!   Java will retrieve notwork object and I can listen to blocks and contract events, and it will start listening once any peer in the connection profile will be ready   ></description> </Issue>

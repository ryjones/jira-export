CDATA In the ephemeral environment such as Cloud Foundry container or newly build app on Docker/k8s clusters, having local file system "$HOME/.hfc-key-store" breaks the system since those files under $HOME/.hfc-key-store can not be restored by CF or k8s system.  I wonder if this change under review will address the need to store these keys onto external system such as Cloudant or not.  I'm aware that enrollment certificates can be stored in cloudant now implemented in :  ã€€https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/fabric-client/lib/impl/CouchDBKeyValueStore.js  Appreciate if you could comment on it. Otherwise, we need to implement our own backup / restore for the project under development.   ></body> </Action>

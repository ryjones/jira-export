CDATA "balance-transfer" application doesnâ€™t check all of the proposal responses.  An app sends a transaction proposal to multiple peers and get multiple responses. However, the only first response "proposalResponses 0 " is checked repeatedly in the loop like the below.  {code:java} for (var i in proposalResponses) { 	let one_good = false; 	if (proposalResponses && proposalResponses 0 .response && 		proposalResponses 0 .response.status === 200) { 		one_good = true; 		logger.info('transaction proposal was good'); 	} else { 		logger.error('transaction proposal was bad'); 	} 	all_good = all_good & one_good; } {code}  We need to fix the code to check all of the array value of proposalResponses correctly. The following codes have this problem.  fabric-samples/balance-transfer/app/install-chaincode.js fabric-samples/balance-transfer/app/instantiate-chaincode.js fabric-samples/balance-transfer/app/invoke-transaction.js  ></description> </Issue>

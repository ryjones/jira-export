CDATA Will add in a High level query object to handle the actual sending to fabric and getting the results. The query handlers will just have to work a looking at the results and deciding which peers to send to.  The results from the new high level query will be an object key by peer names and will have either an Error or a Response, where the Error is the error thrown from the sending to the specific peer or the Response is the status, payload, and message from gRPC response object of the endorsement.  The handler will be in charge of interpreting the results and throwing an error or returning a byte   .. which for the provided query handlers will be the response to the query.  ></body> </Action>

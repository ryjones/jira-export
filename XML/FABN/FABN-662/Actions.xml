CDATA Despite repeated requests on the channel and detailed explanation above, looks like it's not gonna get more than one vote (thanks  ~binhn  for that).  I moved it to v1.1.  This is sad because I was counting on this time period before the beta to adjust the API design of the SDKs so they "totally make sense". We couldn't do this before alpha2 because of the crazy daily churns imposed by the changes in fabric and fabric-ca. As a result we are going to ship with less than ideal API designs.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris  there's only one real change directly impacted by the change in the production code, which is test/integration/fabric-ca-services-tests.js, and even there the main changes are removing the "bad" dependencies to test the independence of the resulting "fabric-ca-client" package.  in rest of the test code changes are unfortunately necessary due to the nature of the "tape" testing framework. For good or bad, it's a "primitive" and "simple-minded" framework, where when tests are lumped together under "gulp", there are no clear boundaries or isolation b/w test modules, and as a result of the production code changes, the tests started running into each other as far as the configuration settings are concerned (some were testing with one setting, others testing with another). Most of the test code changes are moving the config settings setup from outside of the test function to inside  lastly, along the way for easier debugging purposes, I went ahead and took your advice to remove all the noise in printout (logger.debug calls) to a file so the console printouts are simply "OK #3 test succeeded" which made my finding the failure much easier. I agree it would have been broken out and I would be willing to do that if it'll make it easier to review and merge this.  ></body> </Action>

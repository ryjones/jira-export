<Action id="72049" issue="44184" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="It is possible to set the {{is_init}} property within the Proposal protobuf using the low-level _fabric-common_ API by setting the {{init}} property on the request object passed into {{Endorsement.build()}}. This is not currently exposed on the Transaction object in the high-level _fabric-network_ API. Given that _fabric-network_ is focused on supporting transaction invocation for business applications, not on supporting admin tasks such as chaincode deployment, this seems reasonable to me. Any admin API built on top of _fabric-common_ would be able to submit an init transaction as part of chaincode deployment. CLI commands can also be used, which is the recommended method for chaincode deployment today." created="2021-08-25 10:47:59.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2021-08-25 10:47:59.0"/>

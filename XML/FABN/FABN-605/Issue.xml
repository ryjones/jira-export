CDATA Currently when creating the network, the consortium and the (ALL) members need to be specified as part of configtx.yaml. After the initial setup, there is no way to use the SDK to add members dynamically.   We need a way to update the system channel with additional consortium members. Without this capability we won't be able to add members to the Consortium or any other channels.  ></description> </Issue>

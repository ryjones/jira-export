CDATA Based on  1  2  and below test scenario, we have found that only one (last proposal response) RWset is considered at VSCC side.  However, this seems to be a problem, if we consider the below scenario.  *Scenario:* Policy 3-of-4 in place and 4 endorsements are received. Out of which 1st three endorsers produce same RWset and the 4th produces a different one (simulated by tampering 4th endorser's file system.  But, this could be the case in other non-deterministic situations).  *Result:* Transaction *fails* with ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE at VSCC. Which shouldn't be the case, as policy is fulfilled correctly. Being the last, 4th RWset is considered while verifying (may be a message integrity issue) and thus the transaction is failing.  _Just to ensure the testcase_, above scenario is simulated by tampering 3rd endorser's file system. Here, transaction *succeeds* as payload verified against is properly considered and the required policy is fulfilled.     We think that this would have been avoided, if all proposal responses are sent by SDK to VSCC for verification.      1   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/v1.1.0-preview/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L1413    2   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/v1.1.0-preview/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L1439   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Support private data collections by adding the ability to pass transient data via the submitTransaction function  Proposal: * Add a *setTransient**()* method to the *Contract* class ** Single argument of type Map, which contains the name/value pairs of transient data * If set, all subsequent invocations of *submitTransaction**()* will use this map in the *transient* property of the transaction proposal structure * The data can be 'unset', if necessary, by invoking *setTransient**(null)*     Rationale  This method mirrors the *getTransient()* method in the shim API (smart contract), so there is consistency in the programming model between the setting and getting of transient data across these two components.  ></description> </Issue>

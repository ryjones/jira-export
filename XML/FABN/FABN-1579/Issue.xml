CDATA sdk-node has been a monorepo for a while Now we have `fabric-common`, `fabric-network`, `fabric-ca-client` packages in single source repos.  Other hyperledger project use different tools such as  Rush.js|https://rushjs.io/ ,  lerna |https://github.com/lerna/lerna |  We should apply one among these. It could make management easy without leave project root nor with too much manual scripting.   ~mbwhite  has successfully migrate chaincode-node to use rush.js. May he could help  Personally speaking I prefer to use Lerna, while they are quite similar.   This would also helpful to simulating sub-project node_modules and making integration test more reliable   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I definitely think it would be good to start using a monorepo manager for the SDK. Here's some background on why we chose Rush.js for the chaincode node monorepo.  We had used Lerna on a previous monorepo (Hyperledger Composer) and never managed to successfully lock down the versions of its dependencies:  How can I successfully lock down node module dependencies in a monorepo?| https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46492597/how-can-i-successfully-lock-down-node-module-dependencies-in-a-monorepo    By default Rush.js uses pnpm instead of npm which can cause issues with some modules but we haven't had any big problems getting everything working and so far Rush.js has worked really well.  ></body> </Action>

Starting with 7 they have first class support for monorepos and internal dependency management. It may be worth waiting if its not a 1-to-1 mapping and waiting for the first class support npm 7 will offer." created="2020-06-18 16:15:03.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2020-06-18 16:15:03.0"/>

CDATA I profess I didn't dig deep into it, but there is a footnote in a blog from the npm team covering the current state(or lacktherof) of monorepos that reads:  "We’re also excited to announce that we plan to bring first-class monorepo support to npm@7. If you use monorepos with npm, we need your feedback! Let us know what you like or dislike about your current monorepo solution."  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Referring to  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/1b7d1287a578ae2d45007609806483da71561e9e/fabric-network/lib/gateway.js#L287   In the function _gateway.getNetwork()_ , if _await newNetwork._initialize(this.options.discovery);_ returns an error after it has been established e.g. if there's an access denied error due to wrong certificate or msp ID, _this.networks.set(networkName, newNetwork);_ is not executed, which means the already established connection is not kept in the Map.   As _disconnect()_ iterates through the networks stored in the Map, the failed connection will not be disconnected  ></description> </Issue>

To stay current we should run builds using Ubuntu 20.04 (rather than Ubuntu 18.04), at least in the master branch. Older branches could stay on Ubuntu 18.04, which would give us more platform coverage." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-10-23 12:48:39.0" updated="2020-10-29 15:58:50.0" resolutiondate="2020-10-26 13:07:56.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="60148" archived="N"/>

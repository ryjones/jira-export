CDATA When using SoftHSM identity provider and cryptoSuite with FabricCAServices, there are no options passed from the enroll() function to generateEphemeralKey(). This leads to the privateKey not being persisted by the HSM (CKA_TOKEN = false) and the key is lost after the session is gone.     Affected versions: v2.2.5        ></description> </Issue>

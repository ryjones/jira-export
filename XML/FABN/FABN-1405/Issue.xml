CDATA The common connection profile defines roles for peers that are assigned to channels.  mychannel: { peers: { 'peer1' : { endorsingPeer: true, chaincodeQuery: true, ledgerQuery: true, eventSource: true, discover: true } } }  In practice all peers have all roles and should be available for all roles to be load balanced. When using discovery peers will again have all roles as there is no ccp definition for the peer.  Removing peer roles will also provide a consistent definitions of the endpoints within the channel, both orderers and peers will use the name of the endpoint in an array.  mychannel: { peers:   peer1, peeer2, ... , orderers:   orderer1, orderer2, ...  }    ></description> </Issue>

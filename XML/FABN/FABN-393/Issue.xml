CDATA 1. Import the fabric-client into a node project with `npm i fabric-client --save` 2. Open node_modules/fabric-client/lib/Client.js  Expected: All of the code should be ES5. It's a best practice for npm modules to have already been transpiled.   Actual: This particular file contains the `class` keyword which is ES6.  The problem this is causing and the reason I'm logging this bug is that this creates challenges when running a project through mocha.   Here is the mocha command I'm using for npm test: node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --require babel-polyfill --compilers js:babel-register --reporter progress 'test/**/*_spec.js'  Attaching the stack trace in a comment for reference of what it looks like when I run a project containing the fabric-client module through mocha.    Here are some instructions for how to do this: https://booker.codes/how-to-build-and-publish-es6-npm-modules-today-with-babel/ and a popular stack overflow on this topic: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29738381/how-to-publish-a-module-written-in-es6-to-npm  There is not much of a way around this for writing tests with mocha using this package so marking it as high.  ></description> </Issue>

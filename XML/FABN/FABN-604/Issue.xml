CDATA Based on what I have understood the purpose of the User interface and likewise many other interfaces such as CryptoSuite, SigningIdentity are that one could replace the implementation with ease for e.g. one could very well see that the signature is computed by a an external entity such as an HSM instead of built in software based implementation.  Since we are dealing with NodeJS which is single threaded it would be a good design choice that these interfaces return a Promise wherever relevant such as the calls to compute the signature. The current design is severely influenced by software based cryptography at present where the synchronous calls will work.   The non blocking implementation of crypto related operations/functionality is required to implement a solution that relies on remote signing servers/HSMs.           ></description> </Issue>

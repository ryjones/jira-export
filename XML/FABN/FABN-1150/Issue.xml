CDATA Before the waitForClientReady method was introduced, it was easier to determine connectivity issues when connecting to peers/orderers. Once this method was introduced this is the only error returned and provides no detail about what the problem might be at all. For example was it connection refused ? was it a tls error ?  In order for self diagnosis, either consider removing this check or if it fails perform other tests to determine the root cause in order to provide more useful information. I would suggest raising an issue with grpc-node to fix this but I wonder if that would ever happen.   ></description> </Issue>

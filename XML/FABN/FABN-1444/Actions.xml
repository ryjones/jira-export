<Action id="66530" issue="43844" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="The issue is specifying an identity that doesn&apos;t exist in the wallet during Gateway connect. This might have happened because the wallet was pointed at an incorrect location (and you are therefore using an empty wallet) or because the specified identity label was incorrect. Either way, the issue is that the Gateway code doesn&apos;t check that the specified identity exists before trying to use it. It should check that the identity exists and, if not, throw a helpful error. Same for the TLS identity." created="2020-01-08 11:54:14.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-01-08 11:54:14.0"/>

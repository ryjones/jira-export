CDATA Using node modules with native binaries in an electron app is problematic. While there is not yet a suitable pure JavaScript alternative (it's currently experimental) it would be useful if the fabric sdk node depended on a more recent version of the node grpc module, which has prebuilt electron binaries that work with vscode.  The current dependency is defined as,  {{"grpc": ">=1.3.5 <1.11.0"}}  Whereas the first version with electron 2.0 prebuilt binaries is 1.14.0.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

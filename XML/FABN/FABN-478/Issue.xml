CDATA If I install the {{fabric-client}} module from npm and try to require it, it fails because {{winston}} is not available. Winston is listed in devDependencies and so won't get installed by default.  Reproduce: {{npm install fabric-client && node -r fabric-client}}  I see that the sample code for the Hackfest installs {{winston}} as a dependency alongside {{fabric-client}}. If Winston is meant to be optional then the {{require}} needs to be moved.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It would appear that if the `contract.submitTransaction()` method is used, whilst the first transaction issued is successful, subsequent transactions do not complete.   My suspicion is that something is occurring in the event handling side, such that no completion notifications are being received after the first successful passage.  This was found when running caliper tests that drive multiple transaction using the same gateway connection  Last successful snapshot: 1.3.0-snapshot.15  First failing snapshot: 1.3.0-snapshot.16        ></description> </Issue>

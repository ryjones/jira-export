CDATA The node sdk creates and returns a FabricCAClientImpl object using the Client.getCertificateAuthority() call, handling the processing of the CCP (Common Connection Profile if I haven't mentioned this earlier).  However I have a need to get the ca name of this CA Server and don't want to process the CCP to try to determine it, it should be something I can get from the returned instance of the client.getCertificateAuthority() call.  Currently I have to do  {code} let caName = caClient._fabricCAClient._caName; {code} in order to determine the ca name from the returned object  ></description> </Issue>

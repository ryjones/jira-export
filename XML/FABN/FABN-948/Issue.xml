CDATA Chaincode packages are in the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec format.  Today, a chaincode package can be created by a user using the "peer chaincode package" command.  In the SDK, a chaincode package is created internally when a user calls Client.installChaincode(), if an existing chaincode package has not been specified.  However, there is no way for an SDK user to create a chaincode package themselves and save it somewhere, if they wish to programatically perform the same packaging task as the "peer chaincode package" command.  This story will expose the existing packaging code via a new "Package" class that allows a user of the SDK to: * Load a chaincode package from an existing buffer/file and get information about it * Create a new chaincode package from a directory * Save a chaincode package to a buffer/file  ></description> </Issue>

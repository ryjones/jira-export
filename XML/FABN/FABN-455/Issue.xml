CDATA Node SDK has introduced a dependency on node-x509. This will compile fine on linux/mac but unfortunately on windows it looks for openssl to be installed at c:\OpenSSL-Win64 as it requires both c headers and link libraries.  This makes it very awkward for windows users to make use of the node sdk without having to work out how to install the appropriate openssl package in a very specific place.  In addition, this results in "sudo npm install" failing in CentOS and RHEL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45193218/npm-fails-installing-fabric-ca-client  ></description> </Issue>

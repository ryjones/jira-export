CDATA Separating this task out from FABN-1039 We should enable npm audit and shrinkwrap so that we can be confident there are no security vulnerabilities present in our dependencies. This step should fail the builds.   We'd also like to make it easy for ourselves if a dependency does cause a build break, by enabling some bot or similar to either raise PRs or create Jiras. We'd probably want to enable nightly builds to help with this.Â   Another thing to consider: - we want confidence that users installing individual modules are not going to run into dependency issues. The top-level package.json pulls in different modules to those pulled in by the individual ones. Do we need to run an npm audit check in all of the packages root directories too?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As part of compatibility / Interoperability testing , We see the following combinations are failing out of *984* tests.    ||Integration test suite||Node SDK||Fabric||Fabric-CA|| Failed|| |1.0|1.0|1.1|1.0|42| |1.0|1.0|1.0|1.1|21| |1.0|1.0|1.1|1.1|26| |1.0|1.1|1.1|1.1|317  (run from master branch)| |1.0|1.1|1.1|1.1|281  (run from release branch)|  Please note that this may look worse that it actually is.  One failure can trigger several other downstream tests.  We are in the debug process and more details will follow.   Enclosed SDK logs.  NOTE: We do see the following scenarios are captured in CI and all tests are passing ||Integration Tests||Node SDK||Fabric||Fabric-CA|| |1.0|1.0|1.0|1.0| |1.1|1.1|1.1|1.1|     ></description> </Issue>

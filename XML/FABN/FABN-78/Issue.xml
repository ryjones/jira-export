CDATA The following change set makes 3 slight changes to the fabric-ca-server's APIs: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6943/  The changes are as follows: {code} 1) To the *enroll* response The response used to be: { "result": "base-64-encoded PEM of ecert" } The response is now: { "result": { "cert": "base-64-encoded PEM of ecert", "serverinfo": { "caname": "<name of the CA>", "cachain": "base-64-encoded PEM chain of signing CA" } }  2) To the register response The field named "credential" was changed to "secret"  3) The context root of all URLs is "/api/v1/cfssl/", but this prefix is no longer needed.  For example, change "/api/v1/cfssl/enroll" to "/enroll".   For now, both are recognized, but I'll remove the prefixed version in the future. {code}  ></description> </Issue>

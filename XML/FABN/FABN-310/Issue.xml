CDATA The balance-transfer sample is a web application that demonstrates the bare minimum of implementing a web application using the node.js SDK: - how to map between an authenticated user (using a browser-friendly JWT token) and a "blockchain identity" (represented by enrollment certificate) - how to manage two types of blockchain identities: "organization admins" and "organization members" - how to dynamically enroll organization members with fabric-ca - how to use various fabric APIs in the SDK to create/update channels, install/instantiate chaincodes, invoke transactions and make queries  Move the sample to the new repo for sample apps for more prominent exposure and avoid the situation where others in the community may think we don't have a sample web app and duplicate the work  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Package: fabric-network 1.4.1  Function: _addContractListener_  When using _addContractListener_ , the  documentation|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/module-fabric-network.Contract.html#addContractListener__anchor  says that we can specify a start block and an end block, as we can for fabric-client  registerChaincodeEvent|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/ChannelEventHub.html#registerChaincodeEvent .  However, I am not able to find how to pass these parameters. Indeed, documentation has +absolutely no information+ about it.  Moreover, I checked what +I believe+ is the  function definition|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.4/fabric-network/lib/impl/event/contracteventlistener.js  (sorry if I am incorrect). It does not seem that it takes into account any option (at least for start and end block) when creating the listener.  Here is a sample code I tried to use: {code:java} try { contract.addContractListener(msg.payload.listenerName, "createBadge", (error, event, blockNumber, txId) => { console.log(error); console.log(event.payload.toString()); console.log(blockNumber); console.log(txId); node.send(event); }, { filtered: false, //start: 10 startBlock: 10 }); } catch (error) { return error; } {code} None of start or startBlock, as well as end or endBlock, works.  So my question is: Is it doable? If so, how can we do it? Can someone update the documentation? If not doable, what is the point using it instead of the fabric-client? Ok it is simpler, but it does not provide the useful functionalities we need from a client perspective.  ></description> </Issue>

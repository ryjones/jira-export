CDATA The fabric-client/fabric-ca-client fetches the node module asn1 from a github link. The package wasn't updated in the past two years so it doesn't makes sense to fetch the "latest" release. This is also creating issues in our central build puipeline that doesn't allow access to GitHub.  Could you release an alpha hotfix?  Change in package.json -    "asn1": "https://github.com/mcavage/node-asn1", +    "asn1": "^0.2.3",  ></description> </Issue>

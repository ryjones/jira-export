CDATA various invokes also changed the way that errors are returned to the application, not returning an error object in the response array as was in previous releases of fabric, it should return error objects for responses that indicate an error.  It's actually not good to have different types of object returned in the responses however as applications will expect this for now we should maintain backward compatibility, but in the future this should be changed so applications don't have to do instance of tests.  ></description> </Issue>

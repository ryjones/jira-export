CDATA A single object instance was used for the default Gateway options. Merging of certain user-supplied configuration values (notably including discovery settings) could cause these configuration settings to leak into other Gateway instances as they ended up sharing the same object for parts of their configuration.  Each Gateway instance needs to build its options using a new instance of the default options.  Bug was introduced in v2.1.1.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *As a* smart contract developer *I want* formal documentation and tutorials regarding the ledger-api *So that* I can learn how to use the ledger-api in my smart contract  *Note: this is dependent on when the majority of major ledger-api stories (i.e. FABCAG-7 to 12) are closed out.*  This is different from the API docs, I'm thinking most likely readTheDocs docs updates.

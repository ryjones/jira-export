CDATA Fabric v2.1.0 is due mid-April, potentially earlier. So we need to think about a v2.1.0 release. Thoughts: - make these changes into master  Tasks: * -ensure we're running against fabric v2.1 - do this by updating the version being tested by the chaincode-test-integration tool (should be pulling *2.1*, not *2.1.0*)- * -update commit of chaincode-go that we're depending on- * -Update docs, references to v2.0.0 etc-  *Above covered by PR #31* * -Release, usual stuff: release notes, version number change etc (?)- * -(Probably) update fabric-samples to use our 2.1.0 version:- https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/fabcar/go/go.mod  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This epic connects all child work items related to delivering a new ledger-api in the fabric-chaincode-node repository.  A short introduction is included below, with a much more detailed design explanation is included in the "Design" section.  We're currently thinking this will exist as a separate package, i.e. in addition to fabric-shim and fabric-contract-api and therefore will live in a top level directory alongside those other apis. However the placement of this work may be reviewed as we iteratively deliver new functionality and test importing it, from a user's perspective.  Introduction  -------------  A typical sequence is for an application to connect to a peer (the 'gateway' into the network channel), and obtain a reference to a smart contract. The Network-shared transaction logic in the Smart Contract is then be invoked by name, and with optional data arguments and return values. The data arguments can include transient data if needed. The logic in the Smart Contract will typical reference and update the shared transaction data, subject of course to exactly how the code is written.  The 'Ledger' is, therefore, a primary abstraction in a blockchain system, including in Hyperledger Fabric; this abstraction allows the concepts of states, world state, collections, transactions, blocks etc. to be tied together and formalised.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The struct type currently validates all fields even if they don't make it to the metadata. These should be skipped.  There are three main reasons why it would be preferable to skip the uneccessary fields: * Since they don't have any role in the public interface of the contract, we might as well ignore them in the validation * Recursively descending into structs can be costly, skipping fields would reduce the number of iterations * One might want to use third party structs as return type (protobuf generated ones for instance), which is currently prevented by the failing validation of unexported fields.  ></description> </Issue>

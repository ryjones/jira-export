CDATA Supplying additional valid data in json tag of struct property causes schema to fail. This is as the schema.go file uses the entire tag value and not just its first bit to be the name for use in the metadata. This means that an object as such:    ``` // TestObject test object type TestObject struct { Chickens   string `json:"chickens,omitempty" metadata:",optional"` Duck string }  ```     Will have a property in its metadata of chickens,omitempty rather than just chicken. The current work around is to use the metadata tag to override the JSON but this isn't what a user would expect.     This is causing issues for users particularly around slices as they need to omit nil slice values as the metadata expects an array not to be null.  ></description> </Issue>

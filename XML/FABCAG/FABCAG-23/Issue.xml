CDATA If a struct has a property which is an array, slice or map of another struct then the metadata produced will not reference the other struct as a component using justs its name but the full component path '#/components/schema/<StructName>'. This causes the validation of the schema to fail.  The issue arises as in schema.go in the metadata package a boolean is passed to mark whether we're referencing a component from a component, the array, slice and map schema builders do not use this.  ></description> </Issue>

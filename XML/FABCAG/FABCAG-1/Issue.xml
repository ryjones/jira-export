CDATA An introduction to the new programming model is here, including a detailed tutorial:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatsnew.html?highlight=new%20programming%20model#improved-programming-model-for-developing-applications    This epic adds the new programming model that was introduced for both node and java chaincode, to Go chaincode.Â  All concepts should be consistent with node and java, subject to differences in language idioms.  A well-documented working prototype exists here: https://github.com/awjh-ibm/fabric-go-developer-api  This is to be discussed at a Fabric Maintainers call - TBC  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Copying the "notes" out of the attached text file:  Notes for grid scan 2019-03-27:  1) In grid-rfcs, the LICENSE-APACHE and README.md files state that the repository is licensed under Apache-2.0. However, it appears that grid-rfcs is intended to be primarily a documentation repository -- is that correct? If so, the project license for grid-rfcs should likely be Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, also called CC-BY-4.0, rather than Apache-2.0.  2) In the "No license found" tab of the spreadsheet, the files with "No license found" do not contain license notices that were detected from our scanning. Where possible, for those that contain Hyperledger code, Apache-2.0 comments should be added. This can be done by adding a comment with an SPDX short-form identifier, such as:  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0  Note that the files in this tab listed as "third party directory", "excluded file extension" or "empty file" do not need to have these notices added.  3) Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, CC-BY-4.0, is the license for Hyperledger documentation. Consider adding notices to any Hyperledger documentation files, such as:  SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0  More information for #2 and #3 can be found on the Hyperledger wiki, at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Copyright+and+License+Policy   ></body> </Action>

Apache 2.0 in that repository is intentional as we want the concepts contributed to be under that license.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Each GET route in the REST API should include a block ID query parameter.  With this functionality, clients can request the data that is true at a certain block height, rather than only getting data for the most recently committed block. This can be implemented as a filter where: {{start_block_num <= request_block_height < end_block_num}}  Note that the query param should be a Block ID rather than a block num/block height, since a fork could cause a certain block num to refer to a different version of state than what was requested.  The default behavior (no Block ID param supplied) should still get the data for the most recent block.  ></description> </Issue>

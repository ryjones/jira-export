CDATA The database migrations should be run via the Grid CLI before the Grid Daemon (gridd) starts up. The gridd should check if the migrations were run when its starts up, log an error and exit. The error message should include instructions to the user to run the migrations via the CLI.    This task will be easy to complete if/when this PR in Diesel is merged:  https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1846   Otherwise this task has to be completed manually.  An example of how that might be accomplished can be found here:  https://github.com/big-neon/bn-api/pull/941/files   ></description> </Issue>

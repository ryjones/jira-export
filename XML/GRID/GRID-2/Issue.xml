CDATA The existing  Track and Trace|https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/tree/master/track_and_trace  client implementations are hard-coded for one RecordType ("fish", and "assets"). A more dynamic client which pulls builds a UI appropriate to any RecordType out of the box would make setting up Grid demos considerably easier. This client could then become the canonical example, replacing both the fish and asset versions.     Full specification for the Universal Client can be found in its original RFC. Note that while it was written with the old Sawtooth Supply Chain project in mind, it applies more or less as-is to Grid:  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/blob/master/text/0014-supply-chain-universal-client.md    ></description> </Issue>

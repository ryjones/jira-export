CDATA Currently, the Get Started page in the Track and Trace UIs has a bug which allows users to be created before the agent transaction is committed. This means that if the transaction fails, a user will exist in the system but it will not be associated with an agent.  The logic should be fixed so that the user is only created if the create agent transaction is valid. It also needs to handle the case where the agent info is valid but the user information (such as the supplied email) is invalid.  ></description> </Issue>

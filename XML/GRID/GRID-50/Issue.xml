CDATA Move the DB migration execution from gridd to a grid cli subcommand.  This should allow for an admin (with different permissions in the db instance) to run the migrations, and the grid daemon can be locked down to just reading/writing from the existing tables.     -The grid daemon should, however, know if it requires a migration, log an error and exit.- This check will be completed as part of a separate story:   GRID-87|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/GRID-87          ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Comment from the HyperLedger Fabric e-mail:  -BYFN  - I am a little confused about the meaning of an  "end-to-end" application? in ==>     _"This will launch all of the containers, and then drive a complete_     _*end-to-end** application* scenario."_           Is it has the same meaning of "e2e" in the file name of docker-compose-e2e.         yaml?     If so,  it shouldn't be an e2e application since it started a *cli*     container:  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="42381" issue="27898" author="christopherferris" type="comment" body="end-to-end (hence the e2e) is a hold-over term. basically, we had the e2e scenario in the fabric repo as a test that covered the entire lifecycle of deploying a network, deploying a trivial application (chaincode) and driving a few transactions before tearing it down. We still use this today. We turned it into a tutorial and it has grown arms and legs." created="2018-03-30 12:44:46.0" updateauthor="christopherferris" updated="2018-03-30 12:44:46.0"/>

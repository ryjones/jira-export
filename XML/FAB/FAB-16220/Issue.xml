CDATA Add GOPATH in connection profile generated by networkLauncher. The existing launcher.go code doesn't add GOPATH in the connection profile so the installation of  "node" and "java" chaincodes are not working. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/tools/PTE/CITest/CIConnProfiles/test-network/config.yaml#L8  I have tested both chaincodes adding GOPATH in the connection profile and observed it's working as expected.  ></description> </Issue>

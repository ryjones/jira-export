CDATA the transaction payload includes the proposal-responses containing the endorsements.  the backend for this processing is asynchronous, it's not complete until the transaction is successfully validated and committed to the ledger, which is notified via an event.  Due to the async nature of the server process, the API should return a context object that can then track the event on the transaction (complete, error, or custom events defined by the chaincode).   ></description> </Issue>

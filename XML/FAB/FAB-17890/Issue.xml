CDATA Implement the ChannelInfo(..) method in the registrar that looks up a channel in the chains map and reports extended information on its status. For this end we have to introduce the follower.Chain and augment existing cluster type chains with means of reporting their status.  - Introduce the skeleton a new type of consensus.Chain implementation: follower.Chain. This will be created and run when the orderer is required to follow the cluster and pull blocks from other orderers. - The plan (for future commits) is for the follower.Chain to trigger the creation of an etcdraft.Chain when it discovers the orderer was  added to the cluster, and vise versa; the etcdraft.Chain will replace itself with a follower.Chain when the orderer is removed from the cluster. - Introduce a new interface that cluster-type chains implement, that allows them to report there relation to the cluster and there status. This is done because the registrar is not aware of the exact type of the chains it is keeping. The registrar cannot reflect on the type as well, as this will cause an import cycle (due to the etcdraft package importing multichannel).   ></description> </Issue>

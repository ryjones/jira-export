CDATA No. This happens only in test code. The solution is either to make the tests run not in parallel, or do something smarter.   ~C0rWin  correct me if I'm wrong but this belongs to the backlog  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have a similar situation with the fabric-sdk-go (a previous version though).  I had to serialize the access to a call creating a new client with a mutex.     Viper is not thread-safe and is supposed to just be read once at the startup of a program, or with the WatchConfig util. The rest of the calls are not thread-safe. They need to be serialized on our side.      https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/268    https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/174    https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/353      ></body> </Action>

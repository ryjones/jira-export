CDATA As concluded in FAB-9205, there is additional information needed to be transferred along with private data after endorsement to support dynamic collection reconfiguration FAB-5096. Therefore while distributing the private data, following information should be populated into {{gossip.PrivatePayload}} message:   1. Simulation block height - the ledger height at which private data was created and tx endorsed 2. Collection configuration - i.e. {{common.CollectionConfigPackage}} collection configuration relevant for tx with private data endorsement time.  ></description> </Issue>

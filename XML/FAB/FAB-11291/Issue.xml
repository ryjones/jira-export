CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client generates a “transfer tokens" transaction.  Upon receiving this transaction, a committing peer redirects its processing to its  FabToken specific validation & commit components.  The transaction is to be marked as invalid in the end and will have no impact on the ledger state.     This one relates to the extension of proto messages to accommodate transfer  transactions and of the corresponding test, testing that transfer token transactions  go through the right path.  The first part was already completed (proto messages definition). The second is  blocked by  FAB-11175.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Point 2 should be tracked here:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-678  Point 1 - Generally, I would take the position that we will only "officially" support building within the vagrant devenv (because it's probably the only sane way to manage this with the resources at hand for the time being).  That said, I would gladly help someone figure out what might be the problem with their environment.  Can more information be provided on what build failures are being observed?  ></body> </Action>

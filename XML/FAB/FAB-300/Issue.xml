CDATA This issue comes up in two circumstances (maybe more): - if you want to "make fabric" or "make images" outside of vagrant - if you try to use a docker-based setup (for peers and membersrvc), all seems fine until you try to deploy a chaincode, where the peer running inside docker is trying to set up another docker instance for the chaincode  in both cases you encounter the error that the image hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:latest is not available. One had to work around it by pulling the ":x86_64-0.0.x" tag and re-tag is to "latest". but that's no obvious at all.  can this experience be improved?   ></description> </Issue>

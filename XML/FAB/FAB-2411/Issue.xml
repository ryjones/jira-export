CDATA This item requires modification of the GetPKIidOfCert function within mcs implementation in gossip, such that we derive the PKIid of a cert from the PK of the certificate and not of the hash of the SerializedIdentity (protobuf marshalled version of Certificate).   The reason is that protobuf marshalling may be leading to different marshalled versions of the same certificate, and thus leading to different PKIids for the same certificate.   ></description> </Issue>

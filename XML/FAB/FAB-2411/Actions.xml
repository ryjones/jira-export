CDATA So, if I could iterate over the MSP managers and the local MSP and try to *DeserializeIdentity* with any of them, I'd get back an *Identity* but that doesn't have a method for getting the public key.  # What if I add to the *Identity* interface a method that returns the PKI-ID? After all, the *msp.identity* actually has a field that's an x509 certificate.  # I see that the BCCSP MSP and the *msp.identity* struct are very tightly coupled, and that the only implementation of an *Identity* is currently the *identity*, right?  # I assume what I can do to be as forward compatible as possible, is to prepend some string that identifies an identity that is derived from an x509 certificate (or that identifies a BCCSP MSP?) and then hash the concatenated byte slice, to avoid collisions of identities that have the same public key but are used in different PKIs?    ~ales   ~angelo.decaro  Your thoughts are also welcome.  ></body> </Action>

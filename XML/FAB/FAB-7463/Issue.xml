CDATA add "make build-checks" target in Makfile to verify the unit-tests in downstream jobs after pull the images, binaries from nexus repository. Existing target "unit-tests" is not working when pull images and binaries from nexus.  Also add "basic-checks" make target to perform basic checks like license, spelling and linter in CI build job before trigger unit-tests job. This change detects issues in the early stage of the build process.  ></description> </Issue>

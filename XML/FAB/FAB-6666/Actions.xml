CDATA # I'm putting a review-needed here because this needs to be voted on, IMO. # Can you provide reasoning? I don't see what's the point of doing it, if from what I understood The code isn't maintained by you like idemix code (i.e) - you only sync the source repo with your fork and expose functions you need.       ></body> </Action>

CDATA We discussed that with  ~binhn  in the context of another commit, but since this issue is completely independent from that other commit, I created a separate issue for that here.   This is our discussion:   Binh Nguyen why would we want to keep this separate instead of in Fabric repo? I thought keeping it in Fabric would allow others from the community to update if necessary; otherwise we would have to work through your repo or fork again.   Manu Drijvers We thought it was nicer to vendor this code as it isn't new code but an external library that we simply repackaged. We don't expect many updates to this code, other than the occasional update to sync it with the original code, and urgent fixes could be done on the vendored code in fabric. However, we are also open to the idea of simply putting the code directly into fabric (rather than vendoring it).   Binh Nguyen Since we have to repackage, we should put it in Fabric instead of another level of indirection. I see that the source is also Apache-2, so there shouldn't be any issues in bringing the code into our repo.   Maria Dubovitskaya OK, we will do it in a separate commit (created a jira issue for that: FAB-6666) 12:42 AM      ></body> </Action>

CDATA -2000  :-)  We should not be doing this.  If we are going to use 3rd party packages and need to modify those packages, we should either:  1) Issue pull requests against the 3rd party repository  (for example, we do this with cfssl in fabric-ca) 2) If we really believe we need to fork the code (which again I strongly recommend against doing), then we *could* consider creating a separate repo for this under hyperledger but not under fabric  In either case, we would still be vendoring the the library within fabric and not including the code in the fabric repo. And in no case should we ever directly update the code in the vendor folder.  You should update the library code and then update the version of the vendored dependency  ></body> </Action>

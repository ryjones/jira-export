CDATA we need to check that the following are covered: a) chainless QSCC - discus with Murali what needs to be put there; simple answer peer MSP admin. b) chain-full QSCC - check READ policy of the chain in corresponds to (some issues we may want to discuss here)  c) chainless CSCC - this is for join channel essentially, where we check that the proposal comes from MSP admin d) chain-full LCCC - function dependent: -> chaincode instantiation one would need to check that invoker is within the instantiators, and owners of the chaincode -> listing chaincodes on a channel: one would need to check that the invoker has read access to the channel info or is the peer’s msp admin -> others? e) chainless LCCC - again can be function dependent, but in the simplest case we can require that proposals invoking LCCC chainless functions need to be created by the peer’s MSP admin. f) Chain creation operation, we need to check channel creation authorization.   ></description> </Issue>

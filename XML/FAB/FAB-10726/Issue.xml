CDATA This corresponds to the 'InstallChaincodeMetadata' step described in the FAB-8787 design document.  This chaincode API should be called {{AgreeToDefine}} and should accept as input a message containing a single field {{Definition}} which is itself a protobuf message with the fields: # Name as a string # Version as a string # Sequence an unsigned 64 bit integer # Hash as bytes (corresponding to the hash returned by FAB-10725) # Endorsement plugin as string # Validation plugin as string # ValidationParameter as bytes  The chaincode API should return an empty protobuf message.  The function should first verify that the user is an administrator of the org per the channel configuration.  Then it should then take the {{Definition}} and put it in the organization's private data collection at key "<hash>".  Note, the ability to write to an org scoped collection does not exist at the time of writing this story, but should be implemented via FAB-8864.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need a to come up with the structure and location for pushing release artifacts.     Options:  1) Nexus3 - this seems like it might work 2) Github - we could try to use github release artifacts (we already push zips of the src per release here)  My preference would be to use something like Nexus3 if we can.  Also seems like Nexus3 can act as a maven repository for Java artifacts as well so that's a plus for consistency  ></description> </Issue>

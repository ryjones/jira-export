CDATA As we replace behave tests with IT tests, we can skip/disable/remove the behave tests from the fabric-test/feature/*.feature files.  Part 1 can be done now: disable the individual tests (mentioned in column B) that are color-coded as gray (unimportant) or green (already covered in other UT/IT tests). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741  We could also go ahead and disable the bright green ones too, which have been resolved since we finished the initial analysis.  This applies to master branch, v2.0.0, so we don't waste compute resources in the next few weeks/months. Before end of year, we hope to have disabled all the behave tests, so it may be simpler to just wait until that happens and then disable them all at once in the older releases.  Update: More tests using NODE cc language were found to be unnecessary, so we can shut them off too: refer to FAB-16266.  ></description> </Issue>

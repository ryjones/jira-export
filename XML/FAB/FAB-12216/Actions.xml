CDATA  ~davidkel   As part of the release process we pin fabric-samples to the relevant node sdk and chaincode releases.   For example see the v1.2 CR here:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25271/   I assume that addresses the main concern here.  Please summarize remaining concerns.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I was thinking about something to handle release candidates and beta's, and to also draw attention to how to use `unstable` and never use `latest`, and for this to be the right place to show a good working practice. unstable won't work at the moment due to it currently pointing to a 1.1 release of the shim as an example due to fabci-138 and will cause issues for any running or testing of the samples that are using `unstable`  For example the current release 1.3 branch of the samples has this {code} { 	"name": "chaincode_example02", 	"version": "1.0.0", 	"description": "chaincode_example02 chaincode implemented in node.js", 	"engines": { 		"node": ">=8.4.0", 		"npm": ">=5.3.0" 	}, 	"scripts": { "start" : "node chaincode_example02.js" }, 	"engine-strict": true, 	"license": "Apache-2.0", 	"dependencies": { 		"fabric-shim": "unstable" 	} } {code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Master samples use latest "unstable". Release samples use the specific release. For example release-1.2 samples use "~1.2.0". This will pick up the latest 3rd digit module available from npm. I think that's as good as we're going to get it.   ~davidkel  I'll return for now, feel free to close or re-open with more specific suggestion.  ></body> </Action>

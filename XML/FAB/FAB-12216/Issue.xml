CDATA Due to a deployment issue here FABCI-138 and also looking at the samples for node, there needs to be policy for addressing the correct versions of the fabric-shim, fabric-client and fabric-ca-client for each release branch as well as master.  The rules should be 1. Never use latest 2. Use unstable for the master branch only (requires FABCI-138 to be addressed as at the moment unstable does not guarantee it is from the master branch which is likely to break the samples in master) 3. All release branches should target a specific official release of fabric-shim, fabric-client, fabric-ca-client (eg for 1.2 it should specify 1.2.0 for shim, 1.2.2 from client and ca-client) 4. Release candidates will have to target the appropriate snapshot version of the components until they produce an official release then fabric-samples will need to be updated to reference those official release versions, or maybe there is a semver tag that can get the latest snapshot but if an officlal release is available it will get that instead, which could then be left for 3, something like `>=1.3.0-0 < 1.4.0` ?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA the biggest "blocker" here is how nodes that are supposed to get the actual data would get it if they were not part of the original endorsement and/or join a channel late.  I think there are ways to handle this with "local" storage available when endorsing a transaction combined with using gossip for receiving missing "data" and/or distributing the private data in the first place.  As long as things are kept within the scope of a channel, this should be "doable" without much complexity.  It would be more of an issue of time.    ></body> </Action>

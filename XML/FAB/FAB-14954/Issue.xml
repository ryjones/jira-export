CDATA Various degrees of Identity Mixer support have been merged into several Hyperledger Fabric versions. While we worked closely with various people in IBM Research Zurich in previous versions of Fabric (1.2, 1.3 with a fully working end-to-end flow in Fabric 1.4)... there is some work to do in order to allow users, organizations, consortiums and integrators to be able to have the full lifecycle of an "Identity Mixer"-like anonymous credentials.  Now that Fabric 1.4.1-alpha was released yesterday, I will start pushing related tasks under this Epic, and will mark the various JIRA items that are being carried over since the good ol' Fabric 1.x days accordingly.  ></description> </Issue>

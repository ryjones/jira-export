CDATA  ~dongming  Sorry for my late reply. SC files and runCase file I used are ones in the fabric-test repository (the necessary changes are performed by the `sed` command above)  And I think the cause was for NL not to set CORE_PEER_ADDRESS, and so the CR ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/14707/ ) will fix this issue.  ></body> </Action>

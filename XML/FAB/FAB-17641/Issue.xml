CDATA When running any sort of docker workflow on a system, the integration test can fail.  This is due to an assumption in the test that fabric is the only entity managing containers on the host. This is not a good assumption as many developers use docker based tools on their workstation.  {code} 			By("removing chaincode containers from all peers") 			ctx := context.Background() 			containers, err := client.ListContainers(docker.ListContainersOptions{}) 			Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred()) ... 			By("checking successful removals of all old chaincode containers") 			newContainers, err := client.ListContainers(docker.ListContainersOptions{}) 			Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred()) 			Expect(len(newContainers)).To(BeEquivalentTo(len(containers)))  {code}  The tests should be updated to further filter the list of containers to those that include the configured network ID associated with the fabric configuration.  ></description> </Issue>

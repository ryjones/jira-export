CDATA > Currently, the ordering service endpoints are encoded in: channel_group.values.OrdererAddresses with a modification policy of /Channel/Orderer/Admins which by default (I think) is majority of admins.  Correct, just for clarity, it is the majority of *ordering org* admins.  > So, I suggest that for v1.2 we move the endpoints to be configured in a new place, under each organization, and in case they are not configured at that place we could perhaps fallback to the old location  I think I generally like this idea.  If we wished to address this TLS problem without modifying the config tree. One option would be to extend the orderer addresses proto to include the MSP ID of the owner along with the address. The nice benefit here, is that it causes no incompatibility with older binaries. But, there's more to go wrong (what if the MSP ID doesn't exist? Or the lengths of the addresses and the IDs are mismatched, etc.).  Personally, I lean towards  ~yacovm 's proposal, but thought I would at least enumerate the less disruptive option.  ></body> </Action>

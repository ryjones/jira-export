However, there are many applications in which the support for SANs may be desired.

It might be convenient to allow flexibility here by extending the cryptogen template to support the definition of Subject Alternative Names." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-04-27 13:34:53.0" updated="2018-11-29 02:14:35.0" resolutiondate="2017-05-01 18:17:04.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="38188"/>

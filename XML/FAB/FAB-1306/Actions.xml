CDATA My intention was to test the orderer's behavior if a CA cert is added/removed from the broker's truststore.  in single or multiple broker setups, I believe the broker has to be recycled after the add/remove cert. What's the expected behavior of the orderer when the connection is broken and when the connection is re-established ?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a chaincode developer I want to be able to enable RYW during key retrieval optionally, so that I can access already updated keys during my transaction.     My suggestion would be to enable this via an extension of the API in the fashion of as `stub.GetTrxState(key string)`.  Having this feature would make chaincode development more appealing and explicitly enable access to data already written during the currently active transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA QSCC GetTransactionByID should return a Transaction  Envelope, not a Transaction. The Envelope contains the signature and Payload, which contains the transaction header and Transaction.  Clients will want the transaction header information when retrieving the transaction.  They may also want the signature to verify that the transaction hasn't changed since the time they submitted it. The return type will change from Transaction proto to Envelope proto.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Questions: Why use both fabric-ca and cryptogen? If you are using cryptogen, you don't need fabric-ca and vice versa (at least for now)   If you are using cryptogen to generate your certificates, you will need to add the following to your crypto yaml file for each organization {code}EnableNodeOUs: true{code}  Also, your endorsement identities for the endorsement policy will change to not just say member, but needs to be more specific to indicate who actually has permission for the endorsement policy. That is, since you are using peer certificates for your transactions, set the member identity to be 'peer' for the orgs; if you are using client certificates, set the member identity to be 'client'.  ></body> </Action>

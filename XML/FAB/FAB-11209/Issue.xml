CDATA Fabric base os image is built using multiple packages out of which Ubuntu is one. There is no process within the FABRIC team which regularly checks for any security or vulnerability reporting for Ubuntu. This scan process needs to be integrated and repeatedly regularly (weekly)  to look for newly found security vulnerabilities in the image.  This should be conducted on older supported versions of Fabric as well as the current version.  Discussion with Clayton Sims mentions, this is only 1 item in pending and in progress state. Opening FAB for tracking.  Documentation mentions - Ubuntu ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage)    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fabric currently has the concept of VSCC and theoretically one can associate different VSCCs with chaincode on a per channel basis.  In practice, this is not the case as the validation "flow" is actually "hard-wired" and there is really no definition / interface defined for implementing "custom" VSCC.  Ideally we should be able to easily add built-in VSCCs to Fabric and also allow VSCC to be built as plugins.  ></description> </Issue>

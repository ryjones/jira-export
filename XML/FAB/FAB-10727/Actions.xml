CDATA  ~pandrejko  in the paragraph preceding the create channel command it says:      We specify our channel name with the {{-c}} flag and our channel configuration transaction with the {{-f}} flag. In this case it is {{channel.tx}}, however you can mount your own configuration transaction with a different name. *Once again we will set the {{CHANNEL_NAME}} environment variable within our CLI container so that we don’t have to explicitly pass this argument:*     I don't see this as an issue.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="46245" issue="31194" author="pandrejko" type="comment" body=" ~ChristopherFerris  - You are correct. The test team asked that we make it optional because it tripped them up.  So I phrased it as if you need to change the peer or org you can edit the .yaml file to set the values outside of the container. And then I added a bit after starting the container , to edit,export and run the 4 env variables. See what you think in the CR." created="2018-06-19 21:42:55.0" updateauthor="pandrejko" updated="2018-06-19 21:42:55.0"/>

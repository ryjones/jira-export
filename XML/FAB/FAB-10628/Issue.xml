CDATA Currently NL sets RFsize to the same number of kafka brokers (-k). Our basic kafka network, which is used in most of our PTE tests, and possibly in behave tests too, uses 4 or more kafka brokers, but they were intendeing to use RFsize = 3 along with MinISR=2.  To fix this, add the "-e 3" option (an option which was recently added to NL by FAB-10393) to all scripts (such as test_nl.sh) that call networkLauncher.sh using kafka option "-k" (but not necessary for the "solo" tests).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA So, questions regarding this: - naming, upgrade and life-cycle operations should be handled by the LFSCC, correct? Does this item have to do with the implementation of this chaincode? - follow up on this, how do you see the endorsement of a system chaincode to take place? Is post-processing that will be supported, and if not, will there be a set of privileged endorsers doing this?  - what would constitute the access control item? Wouldn't this be part of the application libraries? - w.r.t.. access control, would it make sense to have interface btween the endorsers and chaincode extended in such a way such that a chaincode can tell the endorser if the latter should *not* respond to a query? in certain environments, even responding with an error code will not be acceptable.    ~binhn ,  ~marko.vukolic ,  ~muralisr ,  ~ales ,  ~adc  comments?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA I moved chaincode related stories/tasks here now.  To answer your questions: * yes * same as other chaincodes, but for our out of the box scc, we will configure them to appropriate default e/vscc -- at least single signature and document as such. Anyone can change this config * we should have an acl scc to configure, and yes, a lib so that chaincode and fabric developers may use * I think for 1.0, we should be simple (like http server) with returned status codes since we already verify signature on the request   ></body> </Action>

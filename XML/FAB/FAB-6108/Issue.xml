CDATA The packages in the orderer have been re-arranged multiple times, In the process, many of the logging names have not been updated to reflect the new package names.  Consider for instance {{fabric/orderer/common/server}}.  This package logs as {{fabric/server/main}} and debugging is turned on for all components of the system, not just that package.  This occurs via:  {noformat} func init() { logging.SetLevel(logging.DEBUG, "") } {noformat}  All of the ordering (and common) packages should be fixed to define a constant which is the logging package name, which should correspond to the package name in the filesystem relative to the {{fabric}} dir.  For example: {{fabric/orderer/consensus/solo}} should have a logging package name of {{orderer/consensus/solo}}.  Additionally, all of the {{logging.SetLevel}} calls should be modified to set the logging for this package constant, and not for {{""}}.    ></description> </Issue>

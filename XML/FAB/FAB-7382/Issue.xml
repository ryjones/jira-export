CDATA Now that the FileLedger's signaling logic no longer uses the ReadyChan() method and its underlying signal channel, the interface and implementations should be reworked to remove this function entirely.   Comments from the CR (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/16009/) that led to this item, which cover the goals of this task:  1. Removes ReadyChan() from the blockledger/ledger.go interface -- it is not used anywhere anymore 2. Removes the implementation of ReadyChan() from the other ledger implementations, including the file ledger 3. Removes this fileLedger definition (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/16009/3/core/peer/peer.go#66), and instead, simply creates a new FileLedger wrapper the ledger definition above anytime the Reader() call is invoked.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a peer is stopped or restarted, all chaincode containers essentially stop (they actually "crash" as they are only kept running by maintaining a connection to a running peer).   This results is multiple issues and causes confusion for users of Fabric.  There is no reason why the peer cannot actually automatically start the containers for chaincode which should be running.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Mentioned on the call that it might make sense for each of the participants in this image to have a noticeably *different* ledger (different color or different look or what have you). Then in the "blockchain difference" image show that each participant now has the same ledger. It's these individual ledgers that represent single points of failure.  The thing (building?") at the center here would be, what? Something like the DTCC (which establishes provenance for stock/mortgage trades)? The problem here is that without a ledger that each participant has a copy of this process is extremely laborious. And also that for the majority of real-world transactions, there is no DTCC to help establish provenance.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, so I am trying to think this through and I think it's helpful to distinguish between the two issues with current systems.  # Trusting a single party to house and protect the data # With each party having their own database of overlapping data, there will be inconsistencies amongst these systems.   The latter issue includes the first issue because the inconsistency is a result of having an individual party responsible for maintaining and protecting the data. Thus, I think it would be best to focus on the latter example.  I'm not exactly sure how to do this but I agree with  ~joe-alewine  about having different databases of different colors or maybe a line connecting the two databases with a 'not equal' sign in the middle or clashing arrows, such as this photo  https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/arrows-56/98/14-arrow-together-left-up-2-512.png , to represent the inconsistency between the databases. Does that make sense? Either way, this is a great start!   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~joe-alewine   ~yuleeandrea   ~dlesaca   We want to add some more text in the content that goes along with this diagram to better describe what is going on. Basically an explanation of the animation. It may go after the paragraph that starts with "Modern technology has taken this process..." Feel free to re-word it in order for it to fit with the rest of the text.  In the current system, participants are part of a network but retain their own record of the ledger. Ledgers are not shared in any way. This may lead to inaccurate records. In the above diagram, we can see how the participants in the network have a transacttion that is passed between each of them. After this transaction goes through each participant, they make a record of the transaction in a their ledger. However, one participant puts down the record wrong, which can be caused by a communication error or it could have been done intentionally. When this occurs, the rest of the participants do not receive the correct record and the participants are all misaligned. This kind of recording is time consuming and inaccurate. If only there was a better way…  ></body> </Action>

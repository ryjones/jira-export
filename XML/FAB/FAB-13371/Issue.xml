CDATA Certain tests in the {{etcdraft}} package are either too slow (FAB-13200) or too brittle.  If you bump into CI failures, please post the Jenkins link here as a comment. It makes tracking easier for us.  Our course of action should be: # Delete the offending test. # Rewrite the offending test.  Sub-tasks should not be marked as Done unless the offending test has either been rewritten, or we have concluded it is not necessary anymore.  ></description> </Issue>

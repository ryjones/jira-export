CDATA More CI failures:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/29153/#message-b691f445_99c227bb    https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/29054/#message-67296a40_0a896dac   (three failures in a row)  I've also gone ahead and linked in this Jira all etcd/raft flakes I could find under the {{flakes}} label.  Given the number of flakes related to etcd/raft, as a temporary measure to decrease the pain we inflict on others, I propose that we go back to executing all {{etcdraft}} tests serially, before any other tests in the project. (Basically, the {{gossip}} treatment.)  We need to figure out a way to address these issues in a permanent manner however. _If_ CI infra is what's killing us, given that I don't see it changing any time soon, we'll need to fall-back to less strict checks in our tests, though this is understandably easier said than done.   ~guoger : I know this one's been keeping you busy for quite a while. What is your take on how to handle this?  ></body> </Action>

Given the number of flakes related to etcd/raft, as a temporary measure to decrease the pain we inflict on others, I propose that we go back to executing all etcdraft tests serially, before any other tests in the project. (Basically, the gossip treatment.) Can this be done with *Integration Tests*? I think they are ran in serial be default?  as for etcdraft *unit tests*, I still see occasional flakes, although with lower frequency than before AFAIK. And once  debug log is enabled by default|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/29323/7/orderer/consensus/etcdraft/chain_test.go#2794 , I think I'll be able to fix those flakes much quicker.  back to two integration tests failures you linked, I'll post more info in FAB-13920  ></body> </Action>

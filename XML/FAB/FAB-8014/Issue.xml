CDATA *From mailing list:*  I created a program on hyperledger-fabric that could change the state of the ledger by invoking a method of one chaincode through another if they are on the same channel.   However, in your documents it's mentioned that the second chaincode can only access the state of the first.   I request you to kindly update your documents so that the developers can make full use of the capabilities that hyperledger-fabric provides.  *Doc topic:*   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0-alpha/chaincode4ade.html#what-is-chaincode      *The InvokeChaincode() API doc is correct:*  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L66-L80  but we need to indicate the same thing in readthedocs.     ></description> </Issue>

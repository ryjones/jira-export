CDATA Integration tests within the fabric repo belong in the integration tests which are now written in Ginkgo.  The smoke tests use fabric-samples (which needs to change but that's a separate issue).  If someone is using e2e_cli as part of fabric tests, then it should be moved to the fabric test repo.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Go >= 1.13 adds a wealth of optimizations, speed improvements, and new features including: full mod packaging support, a more uniform set of number literal prefixes, error wrapping, and much much more.   The Go FabSDK has recently been updated to support Go 1.13. Teams using go for chaincode and the sdk would benefit significantly by having uniform tooling, packaging, and build environments.  Given that the Fabric 1.4 release is an LTS, we were originally hesitant to jump from the current specified go version (1.11) to 1.13, however, we've noticed zero negative impact.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The following commandÂ on the samples documentation is not working properly on most environments:  curl -sSL https://goo.gl/iX9dek | bash  What happens is that, by default, a docker-ce installation only works with sudo. One will not be able to run docker commands without sudo unless he is root or has configured docker for it (not straightforward).  Said that, the previous command will fail in most environments, because the script being executed run docker commands.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the current chaincode install and instantiate model, installing chaincode simply means the peer writes the chaincode packages bytes to the filesystem.   When chaincode is instantiated, the chaincode image is built and then an instance of the container is created.  (This flow is actually leftover from the old Fabric model where the chaincode bytes were deployed as an actual deploy transaction).  This flow is problematic for several reasons: # The user is left with the false impression that the chaincode package will compile and deploy.  This is not the case (especially for Go where the code is actually compiled as part of the image build process). # It can take time to actually build the image and depending on the host system this leads to unnecessary timeouts. # There are times when the peer host does not have Docker, the correct CC builder or base OS images installed.  It would be better to know this up front     The proposal here is to actual build the chaincode image at install time.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Given how frequently we see flakes in gossip, we need to change our unit test process to skip the gossip package unless the latest commit has made changes to gossip.  This will reduce the unit test execution time and should reduce the number of test failures we observe in this component.  This decision was made during a conversation with  ~denyeart  and  ~mastersingh24 .  ></description> </Issue>

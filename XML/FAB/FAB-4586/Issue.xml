CDATA *Setup*: # Uses e2ecli example. 2 org and 2 peer each ( peer0, peer1 from org 1, peer2 and peer3 from org2). Leader selection is on, and leader set to false for all. # After the last step in e2ecli (query peer3),  find the non-leader peer in Org2 (via going through the log) and stop it via docker stop \{peername}.  # After 15 seconds, do another invoke operation as before (in peer0) and wait 15 seconds. # Start the non-leader peer again via docker start, and continue to query for the value.  *What was expected*: After a short duration of few seconds, query result is 80.  *What was observed*: query result remains 90 for 5 minutes (whole test duration), or in some intermittent case, becomes the expected value 80  after ~150 seconds.  The log from the script command and the peer logs are attached in the zip file.  Note: this is similar to -FAB-4475-, but the container is stopped-started here vs disconnecting from network in 4475.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I did what you described twice and it works for me... I changed simply the e2e script to "wait" in the following sections and it works:  {code} echo "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" echo docker stop peer1.org2.example.com sleep 20  #Invoke on chaincode on Peer0/Org1 echo "Sending invoke transaction on org1/peer0..." chaincodeInvoke 0  echo "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" echo docker start peer1.org2.example.com sleep 30  ## Install chaincode on Peer3/Org2 echo "Installing chaincode on org2/peer3..." installChaincode 3  #Query on chaincode on Peer3/Org2, check if the result is 90 echo "Querying chaincode on org2/peer3..." chaincodeQuery 3 90 {code}  ></body> </Action>

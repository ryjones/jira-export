CDATA According to PKCS11 standard: CKA_PRIVATE - CK_BBOOL - TRUE if object is a private object (vs. public object) (default FALSE)  Changing this to FALSE for public key pkcs11 attribute struct fixed an issue we were having with our Thalas HSM: CKR_TEMPLATE_INCONSISTENT  Commenting out this line also works (since there is no reason for it to be in the pubkey struct). Please also vendor in this change to other projects using it, such as Fabric-CA.  Â   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/bccsp/pkcs11/pkcs11.go#L242  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, Fabric peer does not provide a function to query the details of approved chaincode definitions.  On the other hand, Fabric admins will need to confirm/use the information after approval for their operations.  So, we propose to add a function for querying the details of the approved chaincode definition to Fabric peer CLI.  As a sub-task, we should extend lifecycle protos to add the function.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, in gossip - the peer checks decides whether a fellow peer is eligible for receiving blocks in a channel by checking if it is in the right organization by extracting its organization ID from the peer identity.  In some use-cases it is not enough, i.e: if all the peers use the same root CA. Therefore, we need to also make the peer consult the policies that are in the configuration block of the channel, and check whether a channel readers policy asserts that the peer in question is eligible to read blocks.    ></description> </Issue>

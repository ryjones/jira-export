CDATA Preliminary information for reference from RocketChat {noformat} greg.haskins 4:01 PM to also address that other issue we could compute the hash once during install() and store it with the metadata  muralisr 4:03 PM we do do that at the time of instantiate so the ledger has the metadata in its chaincode record perhaps that's what you mean ?  greg.haskins 4:03 PM what I mean specifically is to use the hash as the container name that would solve both this and the other bug  muralisr 4:04 PM ah  greg.haskins 4:04 PM if we are already computing it, its that much easier  muralisr 4:04 PM we could do that indeed need to think about that a bit but definitely possible  greg.haskins 4:04 PM of course {noformat}  ></body> </Action>

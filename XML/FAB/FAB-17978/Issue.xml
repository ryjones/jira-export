CDATA Until recently we did not have the tooling in place to launch networks using the 2.0 capabilities due to a lack of support in the SDK's for the 2.0 lifecycle.  Now that the tooling exists we should upgrade all test scenarios to use the 2.0 application capabilities.  Acceptance criteria: All tests use 2.0 application capabilities.  ></description> </Issue>

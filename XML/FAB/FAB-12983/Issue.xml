CDATA Add Orderer capabilities that will disable or enable the possibility to perform migration from kafka to raft.  Capability *V2_0* * *V2_0* is required by a kafka-based Ordering Service Node in order to receive and process a config update with consensus-type change, from kafka to raft only. If not present, these config updates will be rejected. * *V2_0* is required by a etcd/raft-based OSN in order to be able to bootstrap from a kafka-based ledger that was successfully migrated to kafka.     Capability method *Kafka2RaftMigration()* will guard most of the code implementing migration.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a fabric deployer, I would like to customize the pre-processing of a transaction proposal so that I can plugin custom validation and filters on transactions from clients in my deployment. * Enables pre-processing of transaction proposals from clients. * Pre-processing determines the validity of transaction proposals. Can stop processing if the transaction proposal hasn't been created by an appropriate client. * Can modify the inputs to the UCC. Can pass additional information to the UCC. * Is a pluggable component (can be created/used without changing fabric). * In more advanced cases, a filter pipeline can be created that allows chaining of a set of filters. Each filter in the chain can allow REJECT, CONTINUE, PASS logic.  *Example* * FAB-2447 desires pluggable validation of client certificates - a pre-processing filter could allow this.  ></description> </Issue>

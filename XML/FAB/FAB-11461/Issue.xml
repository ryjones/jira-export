CDATA I think two things are needed:  1) Need an overview document on Fabric permissions to explain the different levels of permissions. For example there is a good document about ACLs http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_control.html , but it needs to be more clear that these are only for channel-scoped resources.  There are also peer-scoped resources such as chaincode installation on a peer and channel joining on a peer that require peer admin permission.  Peer admin permissions are not described anywhere as far as I can tell, except for some indirect mention on the Membership concepts page about local MSPs.  And then there are coarser-grained channel readers/writers policies that also come into play.  And then there is chaincode instantiation policy, which will be changing somewhat with the new lifecycle.  2) Need each of the peer commands in the command reference https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html to include information about permissions required to execute each command.  Some require peer admin and some require specific channel ACL permissions.

CDATA I completely agree this needs to be done, and some of this work is already underway, as encapsulated by this jira: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10890  Sjir and Anthony are leading that effort, with my help. I can't speak exactly to the timeframe, but we have a call this morning and can discuss it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Joe, thank you for your clear statement of support.  I believe we can best most productively solve this problem by producing the conceptual model of this subarea (declarative knowledge)  providing concrete illustrations and thereafter go through a selected set of scenarios such that all WHY DO WE HAVE IT and WHAT IS IT questions are answered.  I think this work could be more productive if we had available all old design docs. There is relatively little in the chat channels as they seem occupied with other problems, while policies are a very strong element in Fabric!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Started discussion this on DWG last week, and I agree. There are a couple of aspects - the permissions on specific resources, and the policies that can be applied.      There's also a good conversation to be had on the most helpful type of constitutions for how organizations agree fabric configuration changes.  ></body> </Action>

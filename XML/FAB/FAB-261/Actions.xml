Indeed, it would be nice to have a symmetric API for chaincodes and be able to retrieve deployed chaincodes. However, I would be more accurate and say it is most useful for a given peer to retrieve the chaincodes under its scope only, and not ALL chaincodes deployed. Getting access to ALL deployed chaincodes breaks in my opinion the principle of isolation between various population of peers.  If such a global directory were to be made available, then, at least, the possibility to be published in this directory should left as an option when deploying the chaincode.  I believe that a pattern composed of 2 chaincodes (Object <- DirectoryObject) would be more flexible. However, such a pattern will only be practical when cross-chaincode transactions are eventually supported.  Cheers,  F.   ></body> </Action>

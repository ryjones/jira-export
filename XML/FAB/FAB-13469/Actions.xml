CDATA The dial timed out after 5s - the default timeout from the code.  Because the timeout failed, we got an error. The error was reported out of the assertion but, because it's assert and not require, it then tried to close the nil connection and panicked.  I don't know what can be done with this one. With the exception of mixing and matching 127.0.0.1 and localhost, the test looks okay.  (localhost can resolve to 127.0.0.1 or ::1 depending on your current network topology)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Here's a way of going at it:  1. Modify the Docker image so that it spawns three Kafka brokers instead of one. 2. Use a replication factor 3 for created topics. 3. Have the Producers and Deliverers use the Metadata API to find out which broker is the partition leader replica for the given partition, and have the route their requests to it. 4. Verify that everything works. 5. Kill the broker process that owns this replica. 6. Verify that the Producers and Deliverers are using the Metadata API correctly and are rerouting their requests to the new leader.  (That flow may be edited - it is just a suggestion kick things off.)  Let's create linked tasks for the individual work items if necessary, but I would suggest using this story for all related comments, so that we have a single point of reference.  ></description> </Issue>

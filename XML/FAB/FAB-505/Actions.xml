<Action id="19215" issue="12806" author="jimthematrix" type="comment" body=" ~ChristopherFerris  The point of defining the standard log interface (really just 4 methods: debug, info, warn, error) is to allow users to set a logger so that the SDK and the rest of the node.js application uses the same logging utility. This is important because the format of the log determines Ops monitoring, health-check etc. we’ll have a built-in logger in case the user doesn’t have one for the app yet (like during early phase of development)" created="2016-10-12 15:29:18.0" updateauthor="jimthematrix" updated="2016-10-12 15:29:18.0"/>

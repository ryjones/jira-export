The validator/commiter component must never use the txid field directly (other than to verify that it is correct) so that we may later remove this field from protobuf definitions and reduce the size of transactions" priority="3" status="10000" created="2019-08-01 18:15:27.0" updated="2019-08-02 14:13:47.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="54628"/>

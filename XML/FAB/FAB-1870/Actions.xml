CDATA Responding to/continuing a discussion with  ~wlahti  from FAB-2351:  Thanks for responding promptly.  I'm glad that we're tracking the ability to dynamically reassign the level of the log message. I'm looking forward to seeing this feature implemented and released.  In addition, my feeling is that the log level for a given message is actually best known by the developer who decides to print the message. That is, if I want to print out a message in my fabric component, as a fabric developer, I know whether it's something that should break through most filters (i.e. "ERROR" or "FATAL") or something that is useful for when you want to see _some_ activity within the component (i.e. "INFO" or "DEBUG") to something that should really only be shown to *me* as I develop the fabric in my own environment (i.e. SILLY or TRACE).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA With V1, "invoking" chaincode is really sending an endorsement request to multiple peers and waiting for responses.  Only after you've collected enough endorsements would you broadcast to the orderer and it's only when a peer receives a message via deliver from the ordering service does the transaction have any chance of making it to the ledger.  I say all of this because from that perspective doesn't it make more sense for the endorser(s) to generate the transaction id and send back in the metadata for the proposal response?  ></body> </Action>

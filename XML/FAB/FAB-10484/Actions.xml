CDATA  ~nirro  could I suggest the purging test also test transient store purging. Set  CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_PVTDATA_TRANSIENTSTOREMAXBLOCKRETENTION to a low enough value, and have the test create enough blocks, that the transient store purging kicks off at least once. For example if you set CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_PVTDATA_TRANSIENTSTOREMAXBLOCKRETENTION to 5, upon creation of the 10th block the transient store purging will kick off and purge any orphaned entries older than 5 blocks.  ></body> </Action>

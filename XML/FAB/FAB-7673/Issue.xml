CDATA Currently fabric offers this function     {{//IsSysCC returns true if the name matches a system chaincode's}} {{//system chaincode names are system, chain wide}} {{IsSysCC(name string) bool}}     to determine whether a chaincode name matches one of the system chaincodes. As  ~yacovm  mentioned in  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16443/  however, this function shouldn't be used to make any tx validation decision. More specifically, when validating cc deploy/upgrade transactions, this function shouldn't be used to determine whether the deployer maliciously attempted to deploy a chaincode with one of the names reserved for default system chaincodes.     We recommend to create a new function (e.g. _IsDefaultSysCC_) that returns true if the supplied chaincode name matches one of the default system chaincodes shipped in fabric. Given that this might change across versions, the capability framework needs to be used to avoid introducing non-deterministic behaviour across upgrades.  ></description> </Issue>

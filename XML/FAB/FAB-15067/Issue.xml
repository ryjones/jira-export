CDATA I do not understand what the query is trying to tell the user. If the query is run before the CommitChaincodeDefinition with the sequence used in the ApproveChaincodeDefinitionForMyOrg I get results of {"approved":{"Org2MSP":true,"Org1MSP":true}}, which I do understand, these organizations have both run the 'Approve'. Then if I query is run after the CommitChaincodeDefinition I get a system error 500 indicating that the sequence is not correct. Why should the status change, the definition at that sequence is still approved.  If I change the query to add 1 to the sequence, I get a system failure 500 indicating that the sequence is not correct if run before the commit of that sequence number. If the query is run after the commit I get results of {"approved":{"Org1MSP":false,"Org2MSP":false}}, which I do understand, these organizations have not approved this sequence.  What is the query trying to tell me. Why does it have to fail, what does a failure mean ?  ></description> </Issue>

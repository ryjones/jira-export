CDATA peer help text is generated using: {code:java} make help-docs{code} Need to document the process so that people don't try to update the help docs manually, or if they do, we can give them a pointer on the correct process.  Perhaps the /docs/README.md would be a good place, although I'll defer to doc team.       The /docs/README.md may also need some other cleanup as well.  ></description> </Issue>

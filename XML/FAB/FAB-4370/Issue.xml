CDATA The protolator code was created to facilitate the inspection of configuration artifacts.  However, it is more generally useful for inspecting fabric proto messages in general.  By adding the necessary metadata to the protos, the protolator could be used for pretty printing non-configuration blocks and inspecting endorser transactions.  See the TODO in {{protos/common/common.go}}.  ></description> </Issue>

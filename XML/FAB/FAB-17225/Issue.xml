The plan is to keep the tool for developers to use on an as-needed basis, but not run all of the tests as part of any regular CI job. It would make sense to incorporate a small test using LTE (such as that executed in the fabric-test smoke test suite) into fabric integration tests folder in ledger domain, to help ensure the tool is maintained." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2019-12-09 13:48:29.0" updated="2020-01-20 04:22:45.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-20 04:22:45.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="57490"/>

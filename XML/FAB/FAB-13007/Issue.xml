CDATA Testcase FAB-10191 needs to have this capability (to verify a transaction from any thread on ALL peers in the network), which was added to PTE using  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24723/  with FAB-10903.  The original plan was to add 10191 to the daily test suite, too. But now that we are restructuring tests using operator and azure pipelines, we can simply run two tests in parallel: one or more to run traffic, and one to do restarts; afterwards use actionÂ "checkNetworkInSync".  Solution:  When converting to test-input.yml file using operator, be sure to use the action "checkNetworkInSync" at the end of every test - especially those that include chaos (any node restarts or resets, etc).  ></description> </Issue>

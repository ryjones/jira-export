CDATA Configure the peer and orderer to send statsd metrics to statsd and use something like graphite to record and graph the associated data. - Run a workload. - Verify that the metrics make sense for the workload and that the metrics have appropriate names.  Test Setup: 2 Org, 4 peer Docker network, with graphite-statsD container, Marbles02 chaincode with 500 transactions.  Tests Pass if Graphite shows metrics from all peers and all orderers. A list of observed metrics and sample graphs to be added.  ></description> </Issue>

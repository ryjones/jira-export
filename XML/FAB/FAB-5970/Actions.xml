CDATA  ~sajeevkhan  Are you sure you are using configtxgen 1.0.1 and/or are you sure that the updated artifact(s) is(are) being used? I believe that we see this error when using configtxgen v1.0.0 to create new channels with Fabric v1.0.1+  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~mastersingh24   Our cryptogen and configtxgen version is 1.0.1 and our Go Version is go1.7  We first encountered this issue on Fabric 1.0.1. After this we upgraded to Fabric 1.0.2. and met with same issue.   On doing an inspection of the channel.tx and orderer.block we could see ModPolicy defined.  Attached are the ispection results of the channel and orderer block binary results.

CDATA Double-checked with  ~jyellick  who's written the code for this to make sure I'm not missing anything.  JSON looks good, are you sure you're submitting the right channel.tx file and not an old one? This error message only comes up if the mod policy is empty, which is not the case for the JSON file you've attached here.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Sajeev, I hear you when you say you've double-checked this but I'm unable to reproduce this issue.  There is only one place in the codebase that can trigger this and the path that takes us there looks pretty deterministic to me:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/common/configtx/update.go#L85|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/common/configtx/update.go#L60    https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/common/configtx/update.go#L60    ~jyellick , I vote that we close. If the issue persists from Sajeev's side, is there are anything else that he can provide to help with debugging?        ></body> </Action>

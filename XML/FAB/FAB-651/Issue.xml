CDATA The developer guides section is broken and renders as follows:  Application developer guide  -  APIs - CLI, REST, and Node.js (API/CoreAPI.md) -  CLI (API/CoreAPI.md#cli): working with the command-line interface. -  REST (API/CoreAPI.md#rest-api): working with the REST API (*deprecated*). -  Node.js SDK (nodeSDK/node-sdk-guide.md): working with the Node.js SDK. Fabric developer guide  -  Making code contributions (CONTRIBUTING.md): First, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the project's contribution guidelines. -  Setting up the development environment (dev-setup/devenv.md): after that, you will want to set up your development environment. -  Building the fabric core (dev-setup/build.md): next, try building the project in your local development environment to ensure that everything is set up correctly. -  Building outside of Vagrant (dev-setup/build.md#building-outside-of-vagrant): for the *adventurous*, you might try to build outside of the standard Vagrant development environment. -  Logging control (Setup/logging-control.md): describes how to tweak the logging levels of various components within the fabric. -  License header (dev-setup/headers.txt): every source file must include this license header modified to include a copyright statement for the principle author(s). Operations guide  -  Setting Up a Network (Setup/Network-setup.md): instructions for setting up a network of fabric peers. -  Certificate Authority (CA) Setup (Setup/ca-setup.md): setting up a CA to support identity, security (authentication/authorization), privacy and confidentiality. -  Application ACL (tech/application-ACL.md): working with access control lists.   ></description> </Issue>

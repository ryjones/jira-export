CDATA This is because "make license" command fails. Because pptx file does not contain plain text of Apache License headers. . I put patch on Gerrit, that ignores the pptx file on license header checking. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23723/  It seems that when pptx was pushed to gerrit master branch, CI treats it as only documentation change, and CI skips license header checking.  I think, the folloings are the items to discussion:   1  Is it suitable to manage binary file(e.g. pptx, jpg) on git ? Especially that is expected to modify several times ?   2  Is it suitable to skip some test on CI for all type of binary files ?   3  How to check binary document by CI ? pptx is zipped xml file, so TECHNICALLY, it is possible to detect difference between another version pptxes, but I think it seems hard not only to implement but alow to show the difference on the web.  ></body> </Action>

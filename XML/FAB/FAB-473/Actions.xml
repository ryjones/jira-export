CDATA  ~tuand , FAB-29 seems less and less defined every day. I vote that we just close it and create new stories.  We'll need stories to reflect the work still being defined for bootstrapping: * define genesis block contents (e.g. tx format, CA certs, order node certs, orderer config for use by peers, etc.. ) * for each orderer impl, define the configuration info that will be embedded into the genesis block * for each orderer impl, bootstrap the raw ledger's chain (i.e. generate genesis block) * define how does the genesis block gets onto the fabric peers. (e.g. manual copy ?) * make fabric peer exploit the configuration provided in the genesis block * future work on how to update the configuration provided in the initial genesis block.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA # Reduce duplication and number of tests in the fabric-test smoke-test-suite used for verify jobs in the fabric-test repository. These should include a test with each tool in the repo. (More functional test coverage should be put into the fabric-test daily test suite.) # Ditto for the daily test suite. This should provide functional coverage and integration tests leveraging all the fabric family repositories. # Move the other tests, such as long runs and performance tests, to an independent test suite (to be run 'weekly' or 'per release'     ></description> </Issue>

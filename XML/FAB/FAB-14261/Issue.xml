CDATA Hi Fabric experts:  How to insert/write documents to couchdb in bulk by chaincode? It seems that the chaincode shim library( https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim) Â doesn't have such API.  For reading documents, it seems that there is an API named "GetQueryResult"( https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub.GetQueryResult ). In the string parameter "query", we can construct bulk get request.  But for inserting/writing documents, is there any bulk API for chaincode? Thanks in advance.:)  ></description> </Issue>

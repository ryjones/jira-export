CDATA  ~pandrejko  When we send an email, we are not expanding the console log as we would like to see HTML directory at the root..   In the email, you see   Console Logs URL:  https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/972   from the above link, click on `console.log.gz` to see the failed console log   https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/972/console.log.gz      ></body> </Action>

But if I click on   https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/972/console.log.gz    and search on the word Broken nothing comes up.  So, either we have fixed all our broken links which I don't think so because my CR has not been merged yet, or I am looking at the wrong report or searching on the wrong text.     Let's try to sync up tomorrow if we can.  ></body> </Action>

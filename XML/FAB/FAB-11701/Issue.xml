CDATA Define the protobuf messages and services needed to allow a client to request the execution of specific *command*, (i.e.: request import, transfer, list tokens, and so on). The messages should guarantee the following properties: * client request and prover peer response are authenticatedÂ  * prover peer response is cryptographically bound to the corresponding request. The link must be succinct and it should not be possible to derive from it the response's content.  As example of the available commands, an import request command will be defined as well.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA CLI supports sending proposal to only one endorser at a time. This does not allow us to test policies such as "AND". Murali suggested adding a new feature to the CLI invoke command to send proposal to multiple endorsers.  Here are the steps he suggested:  # Step 1: Adding a new parameter CORE_PEER_ENDORSERS to core.yaml to allow user to specify list of endorser peers  # Step 2: Adding a new method like sendProposalToEndorsers to peer/chaincode/common.go and leverage existing code to send proposals to multiple endorsers using list of endorser addresses provided in CORE_PEER_ENDORSERS parameter if specified.  Also, if CORE_PEER_ENDORSERS is undefined/empty, we expect the command to default to using current behavior and CORE_PEER_ADDRESS. # Step 3: Adding related changes to peer/chaincode/invoke.go  In Step 2:   We would expect CLI command to send proposal to all the listed peers, and provide all the proposal responses received (after some time period) together in the transaction that it broadcasts to the orderer. CLI would not need extra logic to evaluate the responses; the validation stage (after orderer delivers block) could handle that.  ></description> </Issue>

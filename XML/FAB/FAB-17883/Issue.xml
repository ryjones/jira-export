CDATA When using an HSM enabled component it is possible under light load for the component to enter an unrecoverable state.  A change was initially added to validate the HSM session prior to making calls to the HSM. While initially suspected to fix the issue, the problem reoccurred. We need to investigate the use of BCCSP and isolate the cause of the unrecoverable state.  This Jira specifically focuses on the crashing and unrecoverable state of the component. A separate Jira should investigate the performance capabilities of an HSM enable network.  Acceptance criteria: Components no longer enters an unrecoverable state if an operation is performed on an invalid session.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Launching 128 peers as part of the fabric network and use PTE to send complex traffic rates. Transaction rates and network configuration will be updated soon here. We plan to model this after https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8208, a test using 64 peers - but with these enhancements: # run the traffic on a network launched in a cluster of the kubernetes Cloud container service, instead of OSI VMs (but otherwise is the same test as fab-8208 using 64 peers) # double the number of peers in each org, so the total peers = 128 # design the traffic patterns to overlap at least partially, for added complexity, so that each peer joins more than one channel, so there are not separate independent subnetworks of peers; one idea is to simply join all peers to all channels, without changing the traffic patterns (the peers used for endorsements, on each channel) # modify chaincode endorsement requirements and the traffic pattern to send each TX proposal to a peer in two orgs instead of just one (as is done with FAB-8414)     ></description> </Issue>

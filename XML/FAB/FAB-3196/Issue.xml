CDATA It should be possible (nss does it, thanks  ~ghaskins  for taking me through)  However, something about the build causes glibc not to initialize the lock needed at dlopen() time causing a crash. <TODO: more info, backtraces, links.. spent two days here>  Gave up to make progress elsewhere, need to come back and resolve. As a workaround in my sandbox, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7927/9/docker-env.mk however, I also needed to install libtool in baseos, which wont work..  For  ~greg.haskins  and  ~mastersingh24  attention and help!    ></description> </Issue>

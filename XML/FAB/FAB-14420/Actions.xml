CDATA  ~mastersingh24   ~yacovm  Is this needed in master still?   Also want to make sure it still works given the recent change to use org specific orderer endpoints.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA well, the peer<->orderer endpoints change is not in any of the branches, not in 1.4 or master because in master it was/is blocked by the refactoring and in 1.4 i should do that this week, so the change you speak of didn't happen yet.  Regardless it's a good point and it needs to be taken into account when doing the endpoint change, however I think this item isn't going to master...  ~mastersingh24  ?   ></body> </Action>

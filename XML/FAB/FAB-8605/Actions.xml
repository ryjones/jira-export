CDATA  ~latitiah   ~scottz   I believe e2e only sends invokes to peer0.org1.example.com, which does have the `peer` role, and therefore these transactions will indeed continue to pass endorsement validation and succeed.  If you change Org1 to be: EnableNodeOUs: false then I expect it would fail endorsement validation.  Please try that.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Actually, on my machine, the transaction fails validation. -^At beginning, I thought this was strange as you said  ~denyeart . But then I checked how the policies are evaluated and found that even in an OR clause, all the children are evaluated. Therefore the failure, because Org2's MSP does not recognise '.peer'. Btw, this behaviour avoids forking. ^-  Still investigating.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So, after having cleaned up my machine. I got the transactions validated as  ~latitiah  reports. I checked also the second scenario by  ~denyeart  and the transactions fails validation there.  This is not a bug. This is the expected behaviour.  ></body> </Action>

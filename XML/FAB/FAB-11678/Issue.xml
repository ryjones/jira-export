CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) fabric client can be built to redeem a specific set of tokens. Validation assumes the input identities match the one of the transaction creator of input owners. If this is not the case, the transaction is rejected at validation time. If the inputs correspond to  outputs that have already been consumed, the transaction is rejected at commit time.    The ledger APIs can be used to retrieve the committed data. I can observe inputs have been marked as spent.  ></description> </Issue>

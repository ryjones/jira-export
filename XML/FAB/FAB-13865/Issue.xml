CDATA * The car ID scheme is a bit unusual (you'd never see it in a real life application) and it is non-trivial to sort (CAR1... CAR999) * Querying all cars is not really best practice (no pagination, assumes maximum car ID of CAR999) * Creating a new car does not check to see if the car already exists  ></description> </Issue>

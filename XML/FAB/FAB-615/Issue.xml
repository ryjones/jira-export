CDATA Here we would need to update the fabric peer and memebrship service crypto operations with code that leverages the crypto API defined in FAB-354. We aim to do this for the *0.6 branch*, and (with other issues/tasks) extend this to the *master* using FAB-580-582 and FAB-744. Smaller chunk work-items involve: A) as long as the signing capabilities are supported by a software provider offering the API defined in FAB-354 (part of FAB-355), we refactor peer (golang) code (NVP and VP) to sign using that library (and its APIs B) as long as the signing capabilities are supported by a software provider offering the API defined in FAB-354 (part of FAB-355), we refactor membership service server code to sign using that library (and its APIs C) as long as ECIES encryption capabilities are supported by a software provider offering the API defined in FAB-354 (part of FAB-355), we refactor peer (golang) code (NVP and VP) to decrypt transactions using that library (and its APIs) D) repeat the process for the master branch   ></description> </Issue>

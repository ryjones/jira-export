CDATA The Kafka orderer currently relies on having the broker property `auto.create.topics.enable` set to true (which is the default).  Kafka best practices recommend setting this property to false for production deployments.  As people start to deploy the Kafka orderer in production, they may choose to use one of the hosted Kafka services (such as IBM Message Hub or Confluent's managed service).  Following best practices, both of these services set `auto.create.topics.enable`  to false.  Kafka nows support an AdminClient API which allows topics to be created.  In order to implement this story, we will leverage that API.  ></description> </Issue>

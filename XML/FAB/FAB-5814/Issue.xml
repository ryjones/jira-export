CDATA In this change series to make the channel config immutable, up until now, the focus has been on removing dependencies on the conflation between the configtx authorization and the config parsing.  The real payoff however is in removing the complicated state tracking logic from all of the assorted mutable components.  This CR tackles the policies.ManagerImpl, which traditionally must maintain a map of pending changes, create multiple implementations of the manager, then stitch them together into a working hierarchy on commit.  This is a great example of the simpliciation which comes from not treating these structures mutably, as the complexity is lowered substantially.  This also means that the temporary "poor man's policy parsing" may be removed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are a few items that need to be done when branching fabric-test to v1.4. * update the PTE version in the following files (may be done before branching): ** tools/ATD/vars/1channel.yml (tag: "1.4.0") ** tools/ATD/vars/FAB12135.yml (tag: "1.4.0") * change .gitmodules ** add "branch = release-1.4" to each of the repos *minus* cello (until cello releases supporting versions) * change Makefile ** "git-latest" target needs to explicitly pull from the set branch ** fabric replace "master" with "release-1.4" ** ca replace "master" with "release-1.4" ** fabric-chaincode-java replace "master" with "release-1.4" ** (Once we are pulling images successfully for the test runs, we also need to ensure that pullDockerImages.sh pulls the correct images from dockerhub) * feature/package.json ** change "unstable" to "unstable-1.4" * tools/PTE/package.json ** change "unstable" to "unstable-1.4" * tools/PTE/README.md ** change "master" to "release-1.4" * tools/PTE/CITest/README.md ** change "master" to "release-1.4"  ></description> </Issue>

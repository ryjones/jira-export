CDATA * One of the major features of v1.1 upgrade is capabilities but they are not defined specifically in the documentation http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade_to_one_point_one.html.  * The documentation should define the list of capabilities that are enabled in v1.1 and what they do. This will help users in understanding the v1.1 upgrades better. * The documentation also needs to specify the list of capabilities the users need to put in to enable the channel capabilities.  ></description> </Issue>

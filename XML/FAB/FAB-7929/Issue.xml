CDATA Find or create a short PTE test, using NL, and kafka, multiple channels and orderers, and integrate into the fabric-test/regression/smoke/runSmokeTestSuite.sh  Test Scenario name: Performance test: 4 channels short test Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with levelDB     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_cc, instantiated     transactions: 8 threads, each thread sends 100 invokes concurrently           thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2           thread 5 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 3, registers events for channel3          thread 6 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 3, registers events for channel3          thread 7 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 4, registers events for channel4          thread 8 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 4, registers events for channel4  Network Topology: docker containers; 4 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels event type: channel event service, listener: block  Client Driver: PTE Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error in the PTE log     each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself in the PTE log The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated from peers logs and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

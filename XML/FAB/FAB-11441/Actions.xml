CDATA  ~joe-alewine  IF you have any extra time next week, could you take a look at  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/5/  ?  Click on *Console Output* in the left nav.  Search for the word 'broken', there's a bunch of gerrit links which are not relevant and we need those filtered out.  But there are a few others in our docs that we should investigate, for example: *18:15:32* writing output...   36%  couchdb_as_state_database*18:15:32* *18:15:32* (line  155) broken      http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/config/intro.html#configuration-files  - Anchor 'configuration-files' not found** *18:15:32* (line   66) broken      http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/api/database/find.html#db-index  - Anchor 'db-index' not found*18:15:32* (line   78) ok            +We should try to fix the true positives here and see if we can get this to run cleanly. THEN we can turn it on and consider failing the doc builds when bad links are added.   (Overall, it does not look like many broken links to me.)+|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02/go/META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes/indexOwner.json   ></body> </Action>

CDATA What branch of the docs are we testing this against? release-1.2, or also master and the other branches? I'd like for us to test them all. If we're going to preserve earlier versions, all the more reason to check to see if anything has broken (I suspect we'll find several broken links in them).  I would prefer not to have an automatic link checker that would prevent a CR from being merged. Because gerrit is difficult, there are times where it's helpful to check in a link that's currently broken but won't when a version is cut (as I did with the ACL doc — it linked to a version of configtx.yaml that didn't exist when it was merged).  ></body> </Action>

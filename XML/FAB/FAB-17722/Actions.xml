CDATA Hello  ~mrshah-ibm r,  We are currently seeing a slow PKCS11 HSM signing process on v1.4.2 release. This is one of the Jira that was referenced by  ~denyeart .  I was trying to check if there would be any error or a indication of use of stale HSM session in the Peer or Orderer log such that it would confirm the need of v1.4.7 upgrade?  Do you think, this could be one of the reason of slow HSM signing, here is RC conversation + log   https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-peer-endorser-committer?msg=C7Kd9yDrvnFYZzGtK  .  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA h2. Description  I found a bug while employing a chaincode with 'init-required=false' flag on the peer node.  When this bug happens, the new joining node can't get any ledger through gossip protocol. I have no idea which parts of code work wrong, but i spend some time to ensure how to reproduce the bug using fewest steps.  i think it only happens when you join a new peer (like peer1) of an existing org (peer0 has joined) of the channel. h2. Condition  Fabric-network: 1 consortium with 3 orgs, each org has two peers, named after peer0 and peer1. （maybe not necessary，but mention it in case） configuration: - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false  h2. Workaround  i found a workaround to solve this problem. you can stop the peer0 docker，wait for a minute，then restart it. now you will see the peer1 start to fetch ledger and work well. i guess its because peer1 becomes the leader peer of this org when the peer0 down. but I cannot analyze it from the code level i also try to restart peer1 only, well, it just dosent work.  ></description> </Issue>

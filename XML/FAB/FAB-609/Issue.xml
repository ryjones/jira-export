CDATA 	//VerifyChain will verify the integrity of the blockchain. This is accomplished 	// by ensuring that the previous block hash stored in each block matches 	// the actual hash of the previous block in the chain. The return value is the 	// block number of lowest block in the range which can be verified as valid.  Also we need to verify that state database is correct, or have an option to rebuild it to ensure it is correct.   ></description> </Issue>

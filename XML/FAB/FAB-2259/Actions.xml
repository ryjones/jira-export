CDATA Discussed this with  ~scottz  and  ~suryalnvs  today. This comes down to an out of range offset request error by the orderer's consumer:  {noformat} The requested offset is outside the range of offsets maintained by the server for the given topic/partition. {noformat}  It is out of range because the broker that we are accessing does not have access to the latest copy of the log.  Working on a combination of min.isr and req.acks settings to make this work.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/peer/peer.go#L126-L139 , the panic messages all appear to be formatted to print just the channel id at the beginning. The second and third panics, however, print the entire Configtxvalidator() object.   See attached log for an example of the messy output, which was captured while CI was having an issue grabbing the correct images, resulting in 1.2 capabilities being attempted on a v1.1 peer.  ></description> </Issue>

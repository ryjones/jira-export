The signing identity is not actually supposed to be used for either the channel creation transaction or for the system channel genesis block and definitely should not be updatable in a config update transaction. We should go ahead and remove all support for setting the signing identity in the configtx package." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-05-04 19:34:51.0" updated="2020-05-06 19:52:56.0" resolutiondate="2020-05-06 19:52:56.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="58893" archived="N"/>

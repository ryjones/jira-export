CDATA I cannot see the above CR in gerrit. From the marbles chaincode implementation, it doesn't return in JSON format when pagination metadata is present. Instead, it returns 2 concatenated arrays at top level:   marbles data    ResponseMetadata  .   Will need to rewrite part of marbles chaincode to return data in JSON format. As  ~chris.elder   said in this  comment|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12052?focusedCommentId=50955&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-50955  , it will change the return formats for both paginated queries and rich queries and range queries.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To ensure that all peers are in a consistent state, we need a way to summarise the current state at each peer at a given block height. Toward this summarization of state, we introduce a BlockCommitHash per block which consists of # transaction validation code # updateBatchÂ  # previous block's BlockCommitHash  Challenges: * Hash needs to be computed in a deterministic way * As previous block's hash is used (i.e., cumulative hashing), the starting block number must be same on all peers  ></description> </Issue>

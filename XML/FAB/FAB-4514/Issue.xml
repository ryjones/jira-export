CDATA commit: 6188bbb0f1fcc2ec8a6d43ba3848f1770e774c12 API-type: cli  When attempting to create a new channel, the command returned "Error: Got unexpected status: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE". I am assuming this error is due to the halting of the channel.  After bringing up the network in the attached composition file, waiting for 5 seconds, and attempting to create a new channel, the following was observed in the orderer log.   From orderer log {code} 2017-06-09 20:30:00.017 UTC  orderer/kafka  Enqueue -> WARN 4c1  channel: behavesystest  Will not enqueue cause the chain has been halted 2017-06-09 20:30:00.017 UTC  orderer/common/broadcast  Handle -> INFO 4c2 Consenter instructed us to shut down 2017-06-09 20:30:00.018 UTC  orderer/main  func1 -> DEBU 4c3 Closing Broadcast stream 2017-06-09 20:30:00.019 UTC  orderer/common/deliver  Handle -> WARN 4c4 Error reading from stream: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled 2017-06-09 20:30:00.019 UTC  orderer/main  func1 -> DEBU 4c5 Closing Deliver stream {code}    ></description> </Issue>

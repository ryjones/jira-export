CDATA Latitia, thanks for opening this.  As noted in Rocket.Chat:  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-consensus?msg=8zujp4f4G6jWf99AF   5 seconds is not nearly enough for two clusters to come up and do leader election.  What you're seeing is the correct behavior: the user should see a SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE and have its client disconnected.  What will change with a changeset that I'm merging this weekend is the logic that's internal to the orderer â€“ its chain won't halt, it will keep on trying to reconnect to the Kafka cluster.  This is not a bug. Closing this, but if I'm missing something, or further clarifications are needed, please let me know. (Or reopen.)  ></body> </Action>

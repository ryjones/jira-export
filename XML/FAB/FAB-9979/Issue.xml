<Issue id="30072" key="FAB-9979" number="9979" project="10002" reporter="adnanchoudhury" creator="adnanchoudhury" type="10004" summary="Case insensitive data in statedb: inconsistent behavior between chaincode invoke and chaincode query " priority="3" resolution="10200" status="6" created="2018-05-09 18:27:13.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:17:31.0" resolutiondate="2018-07-20 14:05:31.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="43027"> <description><! CDATA *Background*: When Chaincode invoke is done, all the strings are flattened to lower-case and then put on ledger and statedb. For example, when a marbles02 chaincode invoke (peer invoke command) with \{"John", "marbles", "red", "5"}, its recorded in the statedb as \{"john", "marbles", "red", "5"} (note the lower-case John).   *Observation*: When the Chaincode is queried (peer query command) to find records with "John", it fails. Query with "john" successfully find the record. In other words, to successfully find a record that was invoked with "+John+", fabric expects the query to be with "+john+". This expectation looks unreasonable.   ></description> </Issue>

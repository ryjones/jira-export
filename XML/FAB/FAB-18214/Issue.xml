CDATA When using the `peer channel joinbysnapshot` command for any sufficiently large channel ledger that needs to be bootstrapped, the operation times out on the CLI while joining. After discussion it was determined that the operation was unexpectedly a synchronous operation (all channel joins are).  Ideally once the join proposal is accepted the CLI would report success and the channel bootstrapping would occur in the background rather than the synchronous nature that exists today.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The chaincode container's log format is currently hard-coded and thus there is no way for a user to update it at chaincode deployment time. The peer has a logging format set in peer/core.yaml (logging.format) that is read in at startup, enabling complete customization of the format.   For the chaincode container, two options are: 1) define a new variable in core.yaml for the chaincode container's logging format  or  2) reuse the logging format from the peer.  This value would be passed in to the chaincode container as an environment variable and used to set the format.        ></description> </Issue>

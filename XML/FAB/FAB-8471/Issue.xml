CDATA FIT-node-x86_64 CI job basically runs e2e.js (e2e tests) and this job was added very early stage of fabric-sdk-node.. Now, these node e2e tests we are running in many fabric repositories like  fabric, fabric-ca, fabric-sdk-node and daily jobs.. so, it's better to remove this job.  ></description> </Issue>

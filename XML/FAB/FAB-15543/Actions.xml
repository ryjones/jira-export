On your suggestion, yes, treating a faulty config as equal to everyone removed from the collection could be a possible choice. Because, even if such a config exists this is almost certain (assuming the answer to above question is yes) that this was never used for dissemination.

Yes, there is a possibility that user trans did not contain any private data at all to start with in which case, fork would happen. BTW, I never suggested marking a transaction invalid outside VSCC. The discussion is only to determine whether to go for marking invalid in retrospection (which is only safe if we can conclude that no such transaction could have happened in the past, for instance its true for 1.4 but not for 1.2).

The code handling we do makes the chain processing halt, and not panic.  Else, the peer is at versions v1.3 or v1.4 and it would have panicked before committing the block.

CDATA  ~ales  - As an additional thought - In addition to treating a faulty configuration as 'RejectAll', if we add another validation in vscc in 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 which checks if a user transaction (not the collection config transaction) that includes private data and the corresponding committed collection config is faulty (i.e., 'RejectAll'), the user transaction be marked invalid. This additional check may not need any capability and will prevent loss of private data.   Again, this is based on the fact that has been mentioned above a few times - i.e., no such block would have anyway been committed in either of the versions. In nutshell, the treatment of 'RejectAll' will help proceed the processing and marking the user transactions invalid would help prevent loss of private data (and give users a hint that they need to fix the broken config).   ~yacovm  - Can you confirm this assertion that the possibility of loss of private data is a corner case where configuration sets the "requiredPeerCount" to zero, otherwise the problem may have happened during simulation as well and no such user transaction would get in a block at the first place. If this is true, we can discuss if we can leave this corner case and just go with 'RejectAll' behavior.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The above comments are fairly confusing. Let me summarize where I think we are...  We want to avoid adding new capabilities if at all possible, and it does in fact seem possible.  In v1.2 a bad collection config will result in the instantiation transaction getting validated, but subsequent user transactions that reference the private data collection will cause channel processing to terminate. In order to fix channels in this state, a code fix will be made (on all releases) such that getPolicy() will return a RejectAllPolicy if the policy cannot be parsed, plus an error will be logged. This will cause AmMemberOf() to always return false. User transactions that reference the bad collection config will get validated, but no private data will be persisted. Between private data not getting persisted, and the log message, users will become aware of the bad collection config and will update their collection configs.  In v1.4 (and perhaps v1.3) a bad collection config will cause instantiation transaction to panic peer. A code fix will be made (in release-1.4, and potentially in release-1.3 if it demonstrates the same problem) in lscc validation logic so that the bad collection config will cause the instantiation transaction to be invalidated. User will fix collection config and try instantiation again.  In both cases, no forks are possible. We are not changing any prior validation status (no capability update is required). The fixes simply allow channel processing that was previously blocked to proceed.  A similar check for bad collection config will also be made at endorsement time, both for lscc and for v2.0 new lifecycle.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA {quote} We want to avoid adding new capabilities if at all possible, and it does in fact seem possible. {quote} We need to fix the problem without capability anyways else the channel that are stuck simply cannot proceed. Capability is an orthogonal discussion for the channels that may not have struck this in the current deployed versions and the capability will help avoid this situation in the upgraded versions.  For fixing the problem in the current versions (i.e., with no capability), the proposal from  ~yacovm  is to make getPolicy() return a RejectAllPolicy. In addition my, suggestion was to mark a user transaction invalid if the user transaction contains any private data corresponding to such collection (the block processing would have halted at a block with any such transaction). The problem with not marking such user transactions invalid is that the private data would not be committed anywhere (because of RejectAllPolicy) whereas the hashed versions will be committed. i.e., no further transactions on such private data will be possible (endorsement for any mutation on such private data will receive error - private data version does not match with hashed version - which I referred to as loss of private data in my previous comment)  So, if you would look at the transactions in a chain, ideally a transaction with faulty collection config should have been marked invalid (which can improve in the future versions by tacking at the simulation side and optionally at validation side with new capability). However, since we are fixing this in retrospection with current capabilities under the assumptions some channel is stuck, the chain would have already marked a transaction with faulty collection config as valid (however, its collection config part would never be used) and the user transaction that referred to such config would appear as invalid.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Discussed with  ~ales  offline and summarizing here again on the choices of user transactions with private data that reference a collection config that cannot be parsed that therefore returns RejectAllPolicy.  Option-1 - invalidate transactions As explained in my earlier message, if we do not mark the transactions with private data invalid, a channel may suffer loss of private data. For including this in the _minimum_ fix, we need to verify that - If a faulty config has been committed in version 1.2, a block with private data transaction (that includes a collection of faulty config) would halt the block commit. If this is true, then we have an opportunity to save ourselves from loss of private data by invalidating user transactions. Otherwise, users may keep submitting private data transactions after applying this fix that would just keep widening the loss of private data.  Option-2 - validate transactions  On a second thought, a block containing a transaction with private data for faulty collection may not at all be possible based on how this configuration is used during endorsement phase. If this faulty config is guaranteed to cause failure during endorsement in the previous versions here - ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/dafa10882ed2e675023ec9f465ca2e6a98275546/core/endorser/endorser.go#L297 ) ( ~yacovm  - this is what I wanted to confirm with you) then the alternate fix could be to change the above code for returning error on having found "RejectAll" policy. The benefit of this approach is that this reduces the changes we have to make in the validation code in retrospection. However, the down side is that we would rely on the endorsement side code for this behavior which could be changed to fix some other bug and hence we would need to specify in comments clearly about this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indeed if we fix the getPolicy to return a reject all policy in case of a malformed collection config, then all peers (regardless of branch version) would *not panic* and also *not halt the chain processing*, and would happily endorse the transaction, *however* all peers would skip that collection (because of the reject all policy conversion) at time of private data analysis at the private data part of gossip and (as you correctly say) - private data would be lost because the hashes are in the block but the pre-images are not in the private data DB.  Also you are right that changing the endorser code to explicitly check (I guess via a reference comparison) whether the policy we have is the reject all policy or not prior to dissemination, and aborting the endorsements in such a case - would make sure peers (after the fix) won't endorse private data for collections with malformed config.   However, this is simply because we didn't fix the core issue - there is no collection policy sanity check at LSCC validation. If we assume we put a validation check (without a capability) of the collection config in LSCC: * All 1.4 peers that receive a block with a malformed collection config die from the instantiate, so after fixing them and restarting them - they will skip the instantiate transaction.  * All pre 1.4 peers that receive a block with a malformed collection config don't die, but halt the chain and never commit the block, so after fixing them and restarting them - they will skip the instantiate transaction. * All pre and post 1.4 peers that never received a block with a malformed collection config and are upgraded and *later* receive a block with malformed collection config, don't validate the transaction either.   So I agree on the facts but I am not sure I agree with the resolution. It's true that a validation check is riskier than a check in the endorsement path, but doing a specific check to see if it's a "reject all" policy seems to me a bit hacky.  ~manish-sethi   ~ales  what do you think?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~wenjian  for reproducing this. Can you please confirm the following  with version 1.2 and 1.3 (1.3 should be similar to 1.2, I guess) -  1) The instantiation transaction with wrong collection config gets committed 2) The user transaction for faulty collection gets rejected at the endorsement phase 3) The user transaction that contains only public data or private data for non faulty collections gets committed   ~yacovm  - I agree that "reject all" policy seems a hacky fix and as an alternative, I had considered the solution that you listed above in three bullets. If the problem would have been limited to version 1.4, first and third bullet would work best. The problem is with the second bullet... {quote} All pre 1.4 peers that receive a block with a malformed collection config don't die, but halt the chain and never commit the block, so after fixing them and restarting them - they will skip the instantiate transaction. {quote} Pending verification from above tests, Pre 1.4, peer don't halt at the block that contains the instantiate transaction, rather , they don't even halt on a further user transactions. Because, any user transaction that contains private data for the faulty collection is rejected in the endorsement phase and does not ever make it to a block. So, if we go for second bullet, we would need to also supply a tool that detects if such a faulty transaction has been committed. If the answer is positive, a reset of peer to that block (i.e., rebuild that block onward) would be required which would cascade-invalidate the user transactions (that contains only public data or private data for other collections). So, we need to make a call to take a chance with this approach which - has a low probability at the first place however, this solution could be catastrophic if it has happened.   May be the answer is that in the larger interest, it should be OK to take a chance if some users get affected. Still, it is a point that asks for opinions. So, better to confirm the outcome of above tests and then take a call.  BTW, as observed by  ~wenjian  test above, the first time instantiate transaction with faulty config would get committed even in version 1.4  ></body> </Action>

CDATA yeah  ~manish-sethi  you're right - The network is going to end up with a collection that you can't use, and if we don't gate it behind a capability then a new peer with the fix will invalidate the collection and we're going to reach a state where you can have peers with the collection and peers without that collection. This is actually not that bad if it's a collection config that was corrupted by an upgrade, because we could always fix the upgrade for both types of peers since upgrade overwrites the collection config.  However the problematic part is that you can have an instantiate transaction that gets invalidated (due to us not gating it behind a capability and marking that invalid) in the new peers, and is valid in the old peers - and then you reach a state where you have peers with chaincode definition in the old peers and peers without that chaincode definition in the new peers and then it's bad  - because the organizations might have detected this and "fixed" the collection config by an upgrade and then continued using it.  So your proposal sounds much more appealing now :)   ~ales  what do you think?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A summary of fixes: 1) Without capability (backport to -1.2, 1.3-, and 1.4.2) a) Treating faulty config in user transactions as RejectAllPolicy (fix in function getPolicy suggested by  ~yacovm ) b) Need to make a choice from the two options (option-1=add new invalidation logic; option-2=let transactions validate but don't disseminate private data)  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15543?focusedCommentId=60617&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-60617.  2) Fix for not allowing faulty-policy in lscc chaincode instantiate/upgrade for all releases (endorsement side fix) and validation side with capability starting in 1.4.2 (unfortunately, that's how lscc is - i.e., checks at both endorsement side and validation side).  3) Fix for not allowing faulty-policy in new lifecycle (endorsement side fix)   ~ales ,  ~yacovm  - Does this sound good to you?  ></body> </Action>

For existing chains with transactions that reference bad collection configs, the new RejectAllPolicy fix will essentially cause private data not to be persisted but the transaction will still get validated and be committed.

CDATA  ~manish-sethi   For fix #1 ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/31904/ ), the panic was caused by how AsMemberOf handles the getPolicy error.

CDATA Add VRF(Verifiable Random Functions) Into Ordering Service to Support Large-scale COnsensus NetWork.  Now, Fabric has cft(crash fault tolerant) algorithm to do consensus, like Kafka based ordering service and etcd/raft based ordering service. In the feature, the bft algorithm will be used in the orderinng service. So If we have 100 ordering service ,maybe the network will become terrible. Using  VRF to  solve the network's scale problem maybe a good idea.  ></description> </Issue>

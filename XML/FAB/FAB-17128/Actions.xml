CDATA  ~joe-alewine  The variable substitution does not happen within single quotes in bash.    {code:java} $ a=10; echo "with double quotes: $a"; echo 'with single quotes: $a' with double quotes: 10 with single quotes: $a $ {code}    Actually, the single quote before the variable terminates the left string and the single quote after the variable is the beginning of another string leaving the variable CHANNEL_NAME without any quotes.  The fix is just one approach, there are many ways of doing it.  All of these hassles are due to using json with echo with variable substitution in bash.  ></body> </Action>

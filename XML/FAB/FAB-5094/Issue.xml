CDATA Add a history index and chaincode API similar to public data history to enable the query of history of a private data key.  Additionally, add an API to get private data write sets for a certain block number or transaction id, similar to how you can get public data for a certain block number or transaction id.  For users that need history of private data, until this is implemented, in the interim in the chaincode you could take a hash of the private data and save it with a regular PutState(). Then you could do GetHistoryForKey() on that hashed key to find all the historical transactions for the private data key.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

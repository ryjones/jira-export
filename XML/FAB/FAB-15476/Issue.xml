CDATA In the core/ledger package, lockbasedtxmgr current uses a new instance of CouchDB for every single test executed. Instead we should use one Couch container, and instead initialize new ledgers in the same DB.  This will provide two benefits:  The first is we reduce the likelyhood of a timeout occurring on CouchDB startup. Currently there are over 30 instances of Couch starting and any one can cause unit tests to fail. Using only one instance greatly reduces our exposure to failures.  The second benefit is a greatly reduced time period for conducting tests in this package. Each container takes 10 seconds to start. Reducing to a single container will save nearly 5 minutes off of unit test run time.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I think we could also enhance the tests to do a better job of verifying the privatedata functionality. e.g. the test could execute a query (which requires the private data) on all peers, in same orgs AND different orgs in the collection, including those NOT used for endorsement, to ensure that the private data was pushed or pulled correctly everywhere.  Moreover, a public data query on the peers/orgs NOT in the collection should show that they received the delivered transactions/blocks, but a private data query on those non-collection peers should fail. We have some of this test coverage in a few different tests, but maybe a good sanity test for private data could do all these steps.  ></body> </Action>

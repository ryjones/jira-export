CDATA The multichain work introduced a significant amount of state tracking and updating on a per chain basis.  This state needs to be stored in such a way that when the orderer restarts, it can restart all of the chains which were created and do so with their correct config.  This should additionally support whatever metadata that a consenter needs for restart, such as in the kafka case the last offset committed.  ></description> </Issue>

The chaincode requester certificate information including MSPID is already available to chaincode. In some scenarios chaincode needs to determine whether the client requestor is from the same org as the peer, for example when determining whether to return private data from a peer&apos;s implicit collection. Therefore, this story will make the peer&apos;s MSPID available to chaincode." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-01-24 16:41:40.0" updated="2020-01-29 04:09:06.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-29 04:09:06.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="58034" archived="N"/>

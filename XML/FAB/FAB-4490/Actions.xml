CDATA  ~binhn  agree with you.. But it's better to remove .sh from the file name. So that will call that as a generic bootstrap script.  We can modify like below.  *This command downloads and executes bootstrap script..*  * ~markparz  Yes script is working as expected but reference of the file name is the issue.. We have mentioned (bootstap.sh) but we are actually executing bootstrap-1.0.0-beta.sh.*    ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu  Ok, cool, I see... I pushed a fix here:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10525/   put you and  ~binhn  as reviewers... it's extremely small, just noted in the 1 place.  ></body> </Action>

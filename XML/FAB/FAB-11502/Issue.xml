CDATA we are seeing the following issue in private data e2e tests: 1. ledger height in p0.org1 is 10 (latest block is 9). 2. spawing a new peer p1.org1 and running fetch newest block. getting as a response "Received block: 9" 3. checking p1.org1 ledger height and getting ledger height lower than 10. 4. only after waiting several seconds, ledger height of the new peer is 10.  * as a result, the new peer p1.org1 don't have the most up to date data (don't see instantiation of the chaincode) and therefore the test fails.  https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/hyperledger/fabric@master/-/blob/integration/pvtdata/e2e_test.go#L324  need to check the scenario manually in order to see if there is a real problem in production, or maybe it is a problem with the tests.  ></description> </Issue>

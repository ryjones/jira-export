CDATA Reference FAB-707 for more details. After VP3 restarted, it missed some sequence numbers for transactions that occurred while it was down, so it advanced its view requested a viewchange - but the network had not advanced its view. So VP3 ledger lags behind, and VP3 sends repeated viewchange requests, until the rest of the network decides on a viewchange. At this point, VP3 is a "spare" validating peer node, that could participate if other working nodes stop - but there is not a good way to tell if it is in this state or is intentionally byzantine.  This issue is for implementing an optimization to stop VP3 and other "spare" nodes  from forever sending viewchange requests every 2 seconds, in this situation. As many as "F" nodes could broadcast these wasteful, confusing, useless messages into the network.    ></description> </Issue>

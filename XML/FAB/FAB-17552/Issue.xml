CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like an example in the library documentation that shows me idiomatic usage of the package to create configuration updates and sign them. The updates should involve multiple changes to instruct on how state is managed.  Â   *Acceptance*  I can find an example for updating channel transactions in the GoDoc for the package. It should also sign the config update envelope.  ></description> </Issue>

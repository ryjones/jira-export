CDATA Setup:  Network Topology: 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, each peer with CouchDB container for stateDB, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels. Client Driver: PTE Test Steps: 1) chaincode: each channel has one chancode, marbles02 go chaincode, instantiated 2) 100K transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 invokes concurrently with tx id from 1 to 25000  thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1 thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1 thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2 thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2 3) do the following: Query Chaincode with pagesizes of a)10, b) 50, c) 100 among the 4 threads on the 2 channels, that eventually traverses through all records.  Result: 1)hardware setup 2) RPS (request per second) achieved for queries for scenarios (a, b, c) 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers and CouchDB containers for scenarios (a, b, c)  ></description> </Issue>

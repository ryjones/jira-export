CDATA ??Problem associated here relates to the addition of new MSPs. How can the orderers check that consistently since after a channel's genesis there is no ordering of the new channel's transactions w.r.t. system channel transactions...??   ~elli-androulaki  can you please expand on this with an example?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, so the issue i was referring to is the following.  A new channel request is issued, and this is ordered within the system channel. The orderers now can check consistency of the pairs <msiid, mspconf> in the genesis block with the ones in the system channel.   However, after this channel is created, it can be that new members are added to the channel, e.g., another MSP is approved to be added to the channel's application MSPs. The consistency of the added <mspid, mspconf> pair is not able to safely be checked against the system channel's configuration cause this will be added to the channel via the re-configuration tx that is only ordered among that channel's transactions.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Given my comment below, I think there are two paths to follow:   1. (it may actually not be a bad idea) for v1, we rest upon the application performing the MSP related checks (and all genesis block correctness checks) in advance prior to sending a join channel request to its peers. 2. We have the orderers check the validity of genesis block msps as discussed in the description of this item and the validity of added MSPs by having the leader or any node producing the configuration update block comparing that added MSP's configuration with the corresponding one in the system channel. This would work well for Kafka where we do not need any majority and all nodes are non-byzantine, but to support sBFT in this case we would need to introduce the identity channel.   Would you agree with this  ~kchristidis   ~adecaro   ~mastersingh24   ~ales   ~binhn   ~marko.vukolic ? Adding also  ~jyellick .  Adding also @   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This task refers to a check that needs to be performed by an orderer each time a channel creation request is submitted to the system ledger. In this case orderers need to check that MSPs included in the new channel, are consistent in configuration with the MSP configuration in the system ledger.   That is an msp with id ID in system ledger, has the same configuration as the msp with the same id in the new channel. Orderers should reject channel creation requests if this check is not validated.  *Problem* associated here relates to the addition of new MSPs. How can the orderers check that consistently since after a channel's genesis there is no ordering of the new channel's transactions w.r.t. system channel transactions...  ></description> </Issue>

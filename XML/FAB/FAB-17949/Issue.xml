Right now the config library requires orderer endpoints to exist when fetching orderer configuration. We should change it to optionally check for it rather than require it. For context, in fabric v1.0 orderer endpoints were specified globally at the top level of a config, in the transition to 1.4 its recommended to remove the top level orderer endpoints and specify them instead at an orderer org level. Let&apos;s also use this opportunity to slot in followup story for adding a simple removal function to the API for removing orderer endpoints from the top level should they exist (ie when a consumer is migrating from v1.0 to v1.4)" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-06-02 02:19:03.0" updated="2020-06-03 15:46:00.0" resolutiondate="2020-06-03 15:46:00.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="59097" archived="N"/>

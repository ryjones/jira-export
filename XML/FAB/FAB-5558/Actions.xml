CDATA After much discussion on RocketChat:  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-crypto?msg=bGSxXmraiuXZjDiCd  it was concluded that although perhaps the v1.0 behavior of dropping malformed identities, identities not in the channel, and identities without signature may notbe idea, we must stick with it for compatibility reasons.  Thus, in the CR, all errors are treated as non-fatal.  Strictly speaking, there is no need for the function to return an error, but the interest of less factoring later if ever one is returned, the signature includes one.  ></body> </Action>

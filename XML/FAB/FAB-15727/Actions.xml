CDATA Thanks  ~baohua , I picked a relatively restrictive regex in the spirit of "restrictive at first, possibly relax later". We could use a regex similar to the one we use for the cc version field  {code:go} chaincodeVersionRegExp = regexp.MustCompile("^ A-Za-z0-9_.+- +$") {code}  I'll double check that there are no unwanted side-effects with the container naming.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The change introduced by that CR breaks local development.  Additionally, I have these concerns:  1. the build process should never modify items outside of the build tree 2. pkcs11 configuration is an aspect of how the build system is setup 3. creating the softhsm token may be inappropriate if the current environment has already configured PKCS11_LIB, PKCS11_PIN, and PKCS11_LABEL as required by the tests 4. this change conflicts with the pending documentation update that describes how to install and configure softhsm to use during development  /cc  ~denyeart ,  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~rameshthoomu   ></description> </Issue>

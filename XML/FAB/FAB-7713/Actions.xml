CDATA  I'm not sure why we're discussing this *now* especially since from what I recall - it has been discussed in the past.  Regarding whole (unfiltered) blocks: Each transaction is signed by the client that sent it, and the endorsements in the transaction are signed. The orderer just sets the order of the transactions and it has the signature in the metadata which I believe is provided(?).  Since the peer doesn't produce the block in the first place, and the block doesn't actually convey any information about the peer, there is no point in having the peer sign that information.  Regarding filtered blocks - Since the peer can easily be silent and not reveal any events to the peer, or just reveal a subset of the events, the client *has* to trust the peer. So - what is the point in signing the messages? So the client could prove to someone else if the peer lied? But that would be too late because the client already did the business-related request.   In my opinion, if you as a client don't trust a peer - don't use its event service and find a peer you do trust.   Also - this is not a bug, this is a feature.   Others, please chime in:  ~C0rWin  ,  ~mastersingh24  ,  ~jyellick  ,  ~elli-androulaki  ,  ~ales  ,  ~adc    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Right - no need for the peer to sign this.  It does not add any additional benefit. I'm going to close this.  ></body> </Action>

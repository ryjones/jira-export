CDATA Security code scanning as CI/CD non-voting task of the Fabric Code base was there in prior releases , which has been removed.  In consonance with industry wide doctrine of Secure Development Practice , I propose this to be introduced back to CI/CD pipeline. Following are suggestions : # It should run weekly , preferably Sunday night , as CI/CD or Cron job. # If it is being decided to run as part of CI/CD pipeline , the job should be non-voting as the scan tends to produce large amount of false positive results which makes CI/CD pipeline to fail. # Scan results should be emailed to component leads and  ~ashutosh_kumar  every Sunday night/Monday morning , or whatever time and frequency deem appropriate. #  ~ashutosh_kumar  and Component leads will analyze scan results and create Jira issue , if the scan result found to be valid.  Following tools were used : *   Gosec - For Fabric and Fabric CA * npm audit - for node dependency check * OWASP Dependency Checker - For java dependency check.   ~btl5037 , please add specifics for current scans that are run as part of CI/CD pipeline. Also, suggestions are welcome for good open source security code scan tool for Node js and Java.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As described in FAB-15107, an idemix org will count as an org that can endorse if an endorsement policy is expressed as an implicit meta policy. However, idemix orgs cannot produce endorsements.   This story tracks the documentation changes required to clarify this point, warning the users that the threshold for an implicit meta policy will erroneously count idemix orgs. We likely have to document this in # the place where we describe endorsement policies in the new lifecycle # the idemix doc page  ></description> </Issue>

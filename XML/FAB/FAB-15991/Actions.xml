CDATA  ~ales  To be counted as against the endorsement policy, would this mean that Idemix organiztions would have to have contain the endorsement subpolicies as well? The policies are set as Majority endorsement. So this mistake would happen only if those organizations are provided subpolicies they should not posses.  How common do we think this error will be? If it is a corner case where someone mistakenly gives an idemix org policies that they should not posses, then I think we should keep the documentation restricted to the idemix doc. If this error is more common, then we should add the disclaimer in more places.  Â   ></body> </Action>

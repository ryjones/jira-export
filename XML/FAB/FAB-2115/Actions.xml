I don't really like the background color. ---It is too engineering like.  I think a more abstract image.  Let's get a UX person to look. 2.  I think we need some really eye catching background and some really eye-popping logo that gets associated with fabric 3.  I like for community to have direct links to, obviously the hyperledger community, but to things like rocket chat.  Something where the immediately make a comment someone responds to.  ....even like a 'chat now' that sends a question to a general rocket chat channel.

My comments, merely my first impressions/reactions (and agree with Barry to get UX in on this; I'll flag Sean):  Let's clearly decide on the breadth of the splash page AUDIENCE - ANYBODY interested in blockchain or fabric blockchain? - only TECHNICAL folks? Includes BUSINESS folks? etc.  # I was expecting a "splash" page in the sense of the Corda splash - i.e. expecting almost no text - links only - and a full color background. No scrolling, or paragraphs to read. Not saying this is wrong, just a different type of "splash." # Didn't mind the purplish color - how is that "engineering"? ... Maybe try the text on top of it as BLACK though instead of white. Either that, or darken the purple a little bit. # I like the Hyperledger atomic graphic - on a corda-like splash, that would be a much larger background image that spans the entire screen. I'd recommend that. # HYPERLEDGER text as ALL CAPS and then Fabric text as intiial caps, and at sort of the same font size but not quite, are disjointed. Are these in the same font.  # The text is a little bit neutral, not necessarily wrong though - I was expecting a bit more marketing flair for a splash page. The idea is to make a splash. I could try a version of text and post.  # The differentiation text says why fabric, but doesn't say why blockchain, I imagine that was intended. To some the splash page might be missing the MORE SECURE, MORE EFFICIENT, MORE TRANSPARENT, MORE TRUSTED "business" level messages.  # I think that we're agnostic with respect to cryptocurrency is a key fabric difference also. Though maybe that's still open - if any cryptocurrency could be plugged in/required. And maybe that we're immutable in the true sense - no forks.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Responses:  Josh 1) Corda splash page does scroll and there are multiple sections. I tried to keep the initial page view as clean and comprehensive as possible. All you really need (IMO) is that. I can shrink the banner horizontally slightly to keep the complete description above the fold.  Josh 2) the color can be easily changed. I was exploring with something from the standard GH Pages template colors (sort of a green->aqua gradation) so that it wasn't obviously a GH pages generated content.  Josh 3) I wanted the logo to be roughly the same size as "Fabric" font. It is close but someone with keener eye for that sort of thing could make it exact.   Barry 2) I also have Sean thinking about a Fabric logo, too. I don't think we want the Hyperledger logo to be TOO large.  Josh 4) we have no control over the Hyperledger logo. We cannot change that.  Josh 5) I just copied what we have in the docs today. Spice it up all you like;-)  Josh 6) I don't think we need "Why Blockchain".  Josh 7) we do not want to mention cryptocurrency on anything Hyperledger with the possible exception that Fabric is NOT dependent on mining or cryptocurrency.   Barry 3) the Community page which the link takes you to has all those links (chat, wiki, mailing lists. etc)     ></body> </Action>

CDATA cool deal, great start, nice and clean!  My feeling is that we should have a little more flashy, for this reason... As I mentioned on the call divide out the biz folks with the dev folks, and biz folks would like more flash, but that's not a big deal, starting to get the content / info is great. Plus couple of the community members provided feedback for an operational section for Admin folks, which I think is a great idea as we move forward.   With that said, If we deem this is good enough, colors are easy to change... I like the format better than the first few schemes :)  Since this is HLF, I would want to do less linking to generalized community stuff. We do need links to the project, but more focused.   I agree, I still think "why blockchain" is much more generalized topic, that should be the whole HL level for all projects.  Yes, Sean had some logo's that he was playing with sometime last year... but I wasn't digging any of them personally. I think we need to go back to the drawing board. Would love some artist in the community to propose some... Opened FAB-2185  On Barry 3 item, we can create some new wiki or html pages to concentrate totally on fabric... i.e. Fabric mailing lists(plus maybe some of the more general, Slack icon w/ #fabric-XYZ channel guide for understanding, etc.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Corda has their "tech docs" distinct from this marketing splash page content, whidh gives a clear line between the two. See splash content vs. https://docs.corda.net/. I'd suggest the same split for us.  Notice Corda also uses multiple background images / art on splash - 1) black/grey nodes/wires; 2) red/white atomic structure/lines; and 3) blue/yellow/red ropes. ... All three say the same thing (woven/interconnect) but in rather different ways, both conceptually and graphically; for UX to analyze.   Using a hyperledger logo, only, the same size as the font - okay for the docset pages but likely under-doing it for the splash/marketing pages.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Cool new background image of the brain synapses.

Likewise, each area of our brains serve unique functions, and are not duplicates/redundant with other areas. The argument could be made that hyperledger fabric is now like a brain, however, with the various different channels / different exchanges and ordering service, etc. doing "different" things from one POV.

CDATA I work on many different systems (X86 + POWER), so it is handy to maintain a single Hyperledger fabric tree on a network file system... except that it doesn't work anymore. This network file system quite reasonably does not allow the local "root" user to have any special privileges. Docker runs as root, so Docker can not access any of my files. This is the exact message I'm seeing (below). Is there a quick fix that will allow this process to complete on a network file system, or do I have to start maintaining redundant trees on every machine I use?  {code:java} Building docker src-image docker build -t hyperledger/fabric-src build/image/src Sending build context to Docker daemon 12.26 MB Step 1 : FROM hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:latest ---> 16a67cc02985 Step 2 : ADD gopath.tar.bz2 $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric ---> 22d8393a8d20 Removing intermediate container d8168242f66d Successfully built 22d8393a8d20 docker tag hyperledger/fabric-src hyperledger/fabric-src:x86_64-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT-81fd105 Building build/image/ccenv/bin/protoc-gen-go docker: Error response from daemon: stat /gsa/ausgsa-h2/03/bcbrock/hyperledger/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/github.com/golang/protobuf: permission denied.

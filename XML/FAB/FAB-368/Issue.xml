CDATA  1  https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa  2  identity.linuxfoundation.org  The login has a link to sign-up for a JIRA account that leads to  1  rather than  2 . Then , after creating a JIRA "account" users cannot login. This confuses nearly everyone. Then they try to change their password thinking they got it wrong, and that doesn't help.  Can we disable the sign-up and make it clear that the LF ID is needed to login?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~troyronda   The lifecycle enhancements described in -FAB-6042- will not be done, therefore this work item is no longer applicable, I will cancel this work item.  Different lifecycle enhancements are being investigated for 1.2, and as part of that the intent is to be able to update collection configuration.  Support for updating collection configuration is being tracked in the Side DB future (post-1.1) work item epic, see FAB-5108 / FAB-5096.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I need the first one for FAB-5752 .  Without this - we have a time window that during that time - gossip would use identities that are expired without knowing it.  Also - this capability doesn't change the existing functionality - it's only an extension of an interface that isn't exposed to clients - hence no API / ABI changes.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm voting for this issue, but I'd like to see semi-detailed design before actually implementing this.  For an initial phase, I still believe that we can actually use the node's local time to make decisions for what I call "admission control" where we don't have to worry about non-determinism.  Examples include: * Endorsement request from client to peer - no reason we can't just check expiration of the client's certificate when the client submits the endorsement proposal to the peer * Client broadcast to orderer - again same logic as above (at least in the CFT case - maybe something would need to change for fairness in a BFT case) * Gossip - similar to the above except peers are clients to peers * Signing an endorsement response - maybe we don't do this but in the case of a well-behaving peer maybe it's an easy way to avoid expired certificates  The above is not an exhaustive list, but at least a sampling.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have a semi detailed design in FAB-5752 and a  WIP implementation|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12427/1/gossip/identity/identity.go  (you can only look at the gossip part - but that's not the final code, I'm doing some refactoring so I'll be able to get rid of annoying code paths and consolidate all identity related logic to the identity package - unlike what is today)   Essentially - all gossip needs to to be able to know when an identity expires, so we can delete it immediately from memory, and then all lookups and validations of signatures, policies related to that identity would fail. I can implement this functionality ad-hoc, but I think that having this ability in the MSP interface is better.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In accordance with  ~mastersingh24  's ask above, I would also like to see at least a semi-detailed design, let alone a detailed design (G-d bless our souls!) that everybody can iterate on/comment/ask questions/suggest/answer/clarify...  There is a related discussion here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5752  I am going to up vote this too, in the interim - but we should strive to clarify the "scope" of the underlying work, given that 1.1 is scheduled to be out in less than 2 months... and I note that there are some suggestions for an API change/extension that we should evaluate (and communicate, should we take that route).     ></body> </Action>

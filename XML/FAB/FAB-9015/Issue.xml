Since chaincode lifecycle was moved off of the resources config, and the ACLs are the only small consumer of it, it is too much and too complicated to leave in place to support this relatively simple use case.  As ACLs are migrated to channel config, the resources tree should simply be removed." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-03-20 20:40:26.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:49:10.0" resolutiondate="2018-05-02 03:16:20.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="41587"/>

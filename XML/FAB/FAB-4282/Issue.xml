CDATA Currently, patch set reviewed with two +2 , no errors can be merged when a project maintainer pushes the button on Gerrit. When no maintainer pushes that sumit button, the patch set will be hanging there and developers will have to wait. I suggest that we make hard requirements on when a patch set should be merged and when the conditions met, merge should be automatically done by CI.  Here is the proposed conditions for various builds: # When a patch set with less than two +2 reviews, only affected unit test cases will run. # When a patch set with two or more +2 review verdicts, all unit test cases will run, if success, post full unit test case review verdict of +1 to gerrit. If fail, post full unit test case review verdict of -1 to gerrit. # When a patch set with two or more +2 review verdicts, full unit test case +1 verdict, do merge patch set and merge releated tests.  ></description> </Issue>

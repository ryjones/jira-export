CDATA Changed the description to release-1.4.  As per  ~rickr  request, publish multiarch images (ex: 1.4) along with 1.4.0 and :latest tags to docker hub  This helps sdk's to use 1.4 tag in docker-compose files to pull 1.4.0 (current latest), if the version is changed to 1.4.1 (future latest) that should work without changing the sdk scripts.  ></description> </Issue>

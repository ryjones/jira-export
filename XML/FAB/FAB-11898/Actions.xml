CDATA Commit message:   FAB-11898  archive data for Testviewer WIP  Fix the daily/runPte and daily/runLte scripts to correctly and consistently archive all the daily test suites result logfiles for PTE, OTE, and LTE tests from jenkins into Nexus.  Apparently some output log files had been renamed recently, so they will now be archived from those new correct output locations in jenkins to the new standardized archive locations in Nexus by the fabric-test/regression/daily/run* scripts,  Also this fixes the TestViewer tool metrics.js to retrieve test data (up to 6 months) from the NEW archived locations in Nexus.  With https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26198/ also being fixed today, along with another change last week to produce a new pte report summary file, the PTE results formats have changed - plus the output filenames of the CI automated PTE tests have changed to CITest/Logs/$TESTCASE-pteReport.log. That is why now we are editing the test suite script files smoke/systest_pte.py and daily/systest_pte.py to check for new result strings in new log file names.  ></body> </Action>

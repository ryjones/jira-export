CDATA This is probably the most complex CR in the series, but the new code is still obviously much simpler and more easily verified as correct than the old version.  This CR modifies the config structures to be instantiated simply through their constructors, rather than through the transactional begin/propose/precommit/commit structure which existed before.  Although this CR produces a bit of churn, is it he last real obstacle to removing a large swatch of otherwise unused code.  ></description> </Issue>

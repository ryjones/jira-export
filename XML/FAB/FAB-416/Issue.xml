CDATA (starting out as user story. May be changed to epic once we can discuss further)  A group of peers want to use a private channel into the ordering service such that only these peers can broadcast into the channel, have their proposals ordered with their own sequence number set and have the  batches delivered only through this channel.  From the discussions week of Sept 19, we need # an api CreateChannel(channel_name,  peers) for the channel creator to create the channel and list the peers in the group # an update to Deliver() to specify which channel to send batches on and to verify which peers can connect to  ></description> </Issue>

Actually I get good error messages now returned to the client.  If the base runtime image (baseos) is not found you get an error like this:  Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image build failed: manifest for *hyperledger/fabric-baseos:2.1.0XXX not found*: manifest unknown: manifest unknown  If the builder image (ccenv) is not found you get an error like this:  Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image build failed: docker build failed: *Failed to pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latestXXX*: API error (404): manifest for hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latestXXX not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown  Since it appears to be resolved, closing the issue...  ></body> </Action>

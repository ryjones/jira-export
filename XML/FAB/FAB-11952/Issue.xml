CDATA Due to the lack of existent samples that makes use of Fabric-SDK-Go, our goal is to provide an example that also includes a REST API to allow the integration of external applications.  The highlights of that sample will be: * chaincodes in both Node.js and Go; * a REST API developed in Go; * a Web application as a front-end.  ></description> </Issue>

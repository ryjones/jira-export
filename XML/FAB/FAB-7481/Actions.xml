CDATA A workaround for this is to provide a non-null value for the role.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47175691/unable-to-registeruser-for-hyperledger-fabric-fabcar-sample-project      However, it states in the node API docs ( https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/FabricCAClient.html#register__anchor)  that in fabric-ca-client.register(...) the role is optional. I would suggest that the fix for this go into the fabric-sdk-node to make the functionality match the documentation.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I looked into this problem, and found that this problem reproduced fabric-ca v1.0.5 with latest fabric-samples. If you use master branch of fabric-ca, registerUser.js passes as Zhao Chaoyi says. The related fix is from FAB-5697 which is in v1.1.0-preview, but not in v1.0.5.  I'm not sure that fixing sample code to avoid this problem is a good idea, because fabric-sample seems to be targetted for master at the time. We need some extra effort to keep the samples runnable both for master and stable, but is it worth doing?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~aambati  Can you take a look and provide your opinion?  Are we good on master fabric-samples against master fabric (1.1)?  Is a fix needed against samples release branch (1.0) to work with Fabric release branch (1.0)?  ></body> </Action>

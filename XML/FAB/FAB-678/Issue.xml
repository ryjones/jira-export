CDATA There is currently only one supported way to deploy a peer: build it from source.  This is because we currently rely on the build to produce several synthetic artifacts (baseimage:latest in older versions of the code, ccenv:latest in newer).  Going forward, we would like to support use cases where deployments may be as simple as doing something like "docker run hyperledger/fabric-peer" and all the of the correct things happen including ensuring that the peer environment has the full set resources it needs to run chaincode, etc.  Today, we formally publish baseimage, membersrvc, and peer.  We need to also add ccenv and javaenv to the mix, and ensure the peer/clients are prepared to reference them properly.  This is a task to track the basic notion of "binary deployment".  Until this task is complete, the only supported way to run the peer is from an environment that can complete "make peer" from the fabric.git sources properly.  ></description> </Issue>

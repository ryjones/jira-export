CDATA If you use the service discovery endorsement query, but chaincode is only installed on one peer in the network when endorsement policy requires that two orgs endorse, you'll get the following error message:  {code:java}  discovery  chaincodeQuery -> ERRO 0b2 Failed constructing descriptor for chaincode chaincodes:<name:"papercontract" > ,: cannot satisfy any principal combination {code}  Users don't know what a 'principal' is and therefore they don't know how to troubleshoot this error message.  The related code is at:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/discovery/endorsement/endorsement.go#L153    Ideally the error message should say something like "chaincode not installed on enough peers to meet endorsement policy".  Similarly, we should look at the error message for the following scenarios: len(peersOfChannel) == 0 len(chanMembership) == 0  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As far I can tell syscall.Flock (and other syscalls) is not available on Windows.  This stems from https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10583  We could * rewrite peer/node/start.go in a way that does not depend on syscalls - the syscalls is just used to get a file lock so peer startup can write a pid.... overkill to get a lock on the file if you ask me. Call the file peer.<pid> and write the PID * not to build peer on windows * revert https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10583 so peer is not available as a prebuilt binary on any platform   ~binhn    ~ChristopherFerris   ~greg.haskins   ~mastersingh24  what do you think ?  ></body> </Action>

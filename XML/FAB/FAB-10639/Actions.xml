CDATA Could you please try the following:  # Shut down one of your existing orderers. # Copy its ledger (usually at /var/hyperledger/production/orderer) somewhere # Start the existing orderer back up # Copy the backup ledger to the new orderer # Start the new orderer up  It is difficult to tell from the log you provided what is going wrong.  If the above procedure does not work, it should give us some additional insight.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~guoger   ~denyeart  As what I learned from last year, I guess this error comes up due to my misunderstanding of genesis block usage.   For the new orderer belongs to new orderer organization, we could not config the original genesis block to its environment.  Instead, we should use the block after the config transaction saying "add a new orderer organization" as genesis block for this new orderer.   I have not tested my above assumption. I was inspired by previous fabric Playback about "raft consensus"  ></body> </Action>

For each record in the result set a separate CouchDB keyed query is performed to retrieve the attachment: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/core/ledger/util/couchdb/couchdb.go#L964-L971.  This could be improved by passing attachments=true in the Fabric range query to CouchDB. This would greatly reduce the number of roundtrips to CouchDB." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-11-30 22:52:25.0" updated="2019-07-15 11:29:57.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-07 19:24:33.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="47514"/>

CDATA We have added a new Raft orderer to the network, also added it to a regular channel. All was good until here.  Then we needed to restart all the orderer nodes. New Raft orderer couldn't connect to old ones, hence couldn't pull system channel blocks and kept crashing until old ones are up.  I believe this is not intended, it should just keep trying preferably with an exponential backoff.   Logs are attached.  Note, new orderer recovers when old orderers are up again. Recover logs are at: new_orderer_success_logs.txt  ></description> </Issue>

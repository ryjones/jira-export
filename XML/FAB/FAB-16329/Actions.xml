CDATA Why not keep pulling as it is and fix crashing when not among consenters? Its MSP is already in system channel, so I believe it has the right to pull. Much like a peer in a channel.     Maybe not now, but later this will have a strong use case in our project.     Due to privacy concerns and GDPR, we have private channels between all the peer organizations. I'm checking the scenario when a channel wants to have a separate dedicated orderer.     If being a consenter in system channel is enforced, this means all the channels created afterwards by default will have new orderers as consenters too, which is just the opposite of what we need. Sure, can be workaround by removing those orderers from consenter set, or using profiles with consenter sets, but that will be really inconvenient.     There are ~30 Pension Providers in NL and if all of them join the network, then we are talking about ~900 channels to manage.  ></body> </Action>

As mentioned this is a future requirement. {quote}I'm glad pension is a service provided by the free market and not by the government in NL, but why (or ... what) are you putting it on a Blockchain? {quote} Thanks for asking :)  There are multiple actors in the pension ecosystem in NL, pension providers, employers, identity providers and of course employees. Any interaction with this system typically results in relevant actors communicating each other in conventional ways, regular post, and taking lots of time.  Eventual goal is, to transfer all the pension infrastructure (PI) to blockchain. Calculations (business logic) are done by chaincodes and interactions are signed and stored in blockchain. So, there are no assets, only the interactions.  ATM, we are implementing the pilot part: PIVT, PI Value Transfer. When an employee changes his employer and the new employer has agreement with a different pension provider, employee has the option to transfer his funds to the new pension provider, hence the term "value transfer".     ></body> </Action>

The side effect  ~yacovm  mentioned, _"new orderers wont see new channels created afterwards"_ *is exactly what we need.*   What Yacov suggested, different orderer clusters, provides no help for our case. Let me re-phrase our case: * We are the service provider, running all the peer nodes and orderer nodes initially * We have one public and several 2-org private channels between for each combination of some actors (+ more but not relevant) * These private channels exist, because it's not allowed to be aware of something happened between actor X and actor Y * At some point, actor X decides, PIVT as an orderer, has access to data of actor X's actions with other actors and this is not acceptable. And he requests to run his own orderer * We create an orderer org for actor X, assign it to relevant channels, and remove default orderers from those channels * Actor X is happy, as its private data is not accessible by other orderers * PIVT will be also happy if that new orderer orders blocks for actor X related channels, let it do what it wants in its *isolated world,* dont mess with system channel and other channnels created afterwards * But, this new orderer is forced to be a consenter in the system channel, which will make it a default consenter of all the private channels created afterwards.

CDATA {quote}I don't exactly understand the difference between *being part of sys channel* and *being a consenter in sys channel*... could you be more explicit? {quote} Being part of sys channel means, adding MSP of that org to system channel. We cannot do anything else without doing this first. After that, we can add the org to other channells to. {quote}I think he wants orderers to be observers/learners, meaning - to only get block updates but never take part in consensus. {quote} Right, I dont actually even care if it gets system block updates, but wont hurt for sure. {quote}You actually can create new channels with a subset of consenters in sys channel, although not explicitly documented yet (see FAB-16306). Would that solve your problem above? {quote} Right, this is possible but not much convenient. It will be difficult to maintain large number of channels in that case.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~guoger  well, the procedure for adding an orderer org and a peer org to a regular channel is similar but different.  But, for adding an orderer org, there is a prerequisite, you need to first add orderer org’s MSP to the system channel.  Then we come to our problem, it’s fine to add orderer org’s MSP to the system channel, but I dont want to add it as a consenter to the system channel.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm working on backup/restore of Fabric network for disaster recovery scenarios.  We are backing up/restoring data in peers and orderers but not in Kafka cluster itself.  It turned out to be Kafka Orderer with some data (not fresh one) cannot handle a fresh Kafka cluster with below error:  {color:#FF0000}{{The requested offset is outside the range of offsets maintained by the server for the given topic/partition.}}{color}  IMHO, Kafka Orderer should be able to handle a fresh Kafka cluster since it already has the all required past data in place.  Kafka Orderer should handle this, either: * Automatically (preferred solution) * Or with a command line switch when launching Orderer  ></description> </Issue>

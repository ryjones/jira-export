CDATA Hui,  ~wlahti  told me that he chatted with you about this a couple of days ago and that it didn't sound like it was something you were going to be able to revisit in a short period of time. Given that, i'm picking this up so we can get this in.  Also, we ( ~mastersingh24 and I) are going to go with an https based approach for operational endpoints so this will be implemented with a simple get/put on the log spec for the orderer.  Thanks for the work you have done and, if you wan to jump in on some of the other tasks, please reach out.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

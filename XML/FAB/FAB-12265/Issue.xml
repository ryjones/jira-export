CDATA The peer provides an admin interface to control the logging level of the assorted peer components without restarting the peer.  However, to set logging levels in the orderer, the orderer must be restarted.Â  Frequently in production the ability to set log levels in the orderer without having to restart the process (potentially creating application outages) is desirable.  Management of the orderer logging settings should be administrated just like with the peer, where the local MSP's admin certificates are the only users authorized to modify the orderer log levels.  For this story to be accepted, we should be able to start the orderer at one log level, then as the orderer admin user specify a new set of logging levels (such as "info:orderer/consensus/kafka/=debug") and see the updated logging levels reflected in the log output.  ></description> </Issue>

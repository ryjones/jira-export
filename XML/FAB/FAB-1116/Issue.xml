CDATA Will need a readme on GitHub that explains how to  - write chaincode - connect to testnet lite - use cert to connect (TBD: we may be able to automate this)  *Documentation:* - There is a question of how much we can support with documentation in HF Docs - we need to add at a minimum a way to get started with HF v1.0 december alpha - We’ll want Jim to document the SDK updates. If need be put placeholders that can be added to. We’ll look to see what we can support with the Java SDK - We won't be able to submit queries through REST API. - We'll need to notify users of the REST compatibility and how it won't work with V1 - Need to hook up latest SDK to marbles for this demo and update documentation - Have the leads on each squad start to document what the sprints are releasing at a high level/outline. Then Josh + Nick can smooth it out so humans can understand it.  *Before Dec 16, Gari will cut the code that will go into the Dec. 17th Birthday release. Most likely we'll cut it for the 15th, which is a Thursday (Gari likes Thursday releases).*  _Next steps:_ Develop a delivery schedule for the birthday extravanza, including a demo of the code working. - *We'll shoot for Dec. 2nd for a demo of the testnet lite. This will also be a go/no go indicator.*  ></description> </Issue>

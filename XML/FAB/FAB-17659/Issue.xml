CDATA Now that we have an UpdateMSP function which allows directly modifying various fields of an MSP we should use that where possible instead of relying on highly specific, single use helper functions (such as AddRootCAToMSP and RevokeCertificateFromMSP). We should streamline things and rename functions as appropriate.   I'll update this with more concrete details shortly.   Rename: * GetMSPConfigurationFor(Application,Orderer,Consortium)Org to (Application,Orderer,Consortium)MSP  Remove / refactor * AddRootCAToMSP - likely remove this. any value to a separate function for this when we can just append directly to the fields using UpdateMSP now? * RevokeCertificateFromMSP - consider separate helper for creating CRL given a SigningIdentity and then we can just use UpdateMSP to add the new CRL  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The golang shim UT coverage is around 17%. While the shim is excercised through chaincode UT, we need to add lightweight, targeted UT coverage to the shim layer.  This would entail a bit of refactoring to accomodate mock objects * stream to mock chaincode to peer communication * CC support to mock peer side chaincode support to hold chaincode streams (some tests would involve multiple chaincodes for example)  The mock stream object would encapsulate responses to ChaincodeMessages received. The UTs will be driven through driving targeted request responses though the mockstream    ></description> </Issue>

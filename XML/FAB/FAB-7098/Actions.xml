CDATA Thank you for your reply.  Regarding the first question, I'm using Docker compose. And even if I stop containers and restart it, the same event has always occurred.  About the next question, I was thinking that CouchDB processing is delayed for some reason. As a result, I thought that connection timeout or staying occurred.     As I proceed with the investigation, I found a possibility that it corresponds to the following bug. Events did not match perfectly, but I noticed that the point where too much consumption of memory resources occurred in peer container is the same.  <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5849>     I will update the version of Fabric from v1.0.2 to v1.0.4 and observe the situation from now. Then I will report the result on here.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm sorry to reply late. I upgraded to v1.0.4 and tried the same thing, the problem was completely resolved. Thus I think that this problem is maight the same as FAB-5849 and it was resolved in v1.0.3.  Thank you very much for your replay and cooperation.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Goal is to create a ledger troubleshooting utility that can identify differences between two snapshots from different peers. Utility will take two snapshots at the same height from different peers as input. Utility will then compare each key / value pair between the snapshots. Tool will output the key / value pairs that are dissimilar between the two snapshots.  In future stories, ledger troubleshooting utility can be extended to take the key differences as input and identify blocks/transactions that wrote the keys, to help users understand the source of the discrepancy.  ></description> </Issue>

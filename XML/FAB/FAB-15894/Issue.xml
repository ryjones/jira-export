CDATA The fabric/integration/pvtdata tests only call initMarble, readMarble, and readMarblePrivateDetails. There are other APIs that use other functionalities. Since this is our sample used to verify fabric functionality for private data, it might make sense to exercise all the APIs and ensure thorough coverage. Review coverage and consider extend the existing IT tests for pvtdata.  Refer to Items 43-44 of tab "Behave Testcases" of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741, which included more of the API calls for testcase FAB-6036. Note: the ledger.feature tests are not running daily; they were never quite finished. Nishi had planned additional changes which were waiting for developer code, but then were never merged. To ensure we encompass all the functionality she planned to test for sidedb phases 2 and 3, refer to her intended testcase steps for ledger.feature at:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-test/+/15451  ></description> </Issue>

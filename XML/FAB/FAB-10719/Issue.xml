CDATA The new lifecycle work will need a way to store chaincode to the filesystem.  Today, the peer stores chaincode either in a CDSPackage or SignedCDSPackage, both of which are inappropriate for the new lifecycle.  These existing package formats include references to legacy datastructures that do not make sense in the new lifecycle world, such as instantiation policy, and conflate things which identify the chaincode (ie, its name, version, and hash) with properties of the chaincode itself (such as its type, and code).  This should be a new protobuf message named {{ChaincodeInstallPackage}}. which includes: # {{Type}} as a string (ie, go, java, node) # {{Path}} as a string (as required by some of the current platform packages) # {{CodePackage}} the package itself as bytes (typically a tar file).  ></description> </Issue>

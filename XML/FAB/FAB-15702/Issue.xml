CDATA At the time of generating the genesis.block let's say I have 5 consenters present. Now default channel is created on this set of consenters. Let's say I want to create a new channel, with only 4 or 3 consenters out of 5 then how can I achieve that?    Since it says in the documentation (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/build_network.html) we have to useÂ TwoOrgsChannel for creating the channel.tx and that profile doesn't have any option to specify the consenters.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA After further inspection, this is just how the e2e_cli test for checkOSNAvailability() works. The log level for the CLI container must be set to debug in order to receive the message it looks for in the log: {code:java} 2017-11-06 18:57:40.894 UTC  channelCmd  readBlock -> DEBU 034 Received block: 0{code} If it isn't set or is set to any value other than debug, the e2e_cli will fail even though the command itself succeeded.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA While modifying some logging parameters on the peer side and testing combinations of CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL set and not set, I found a bug where peer commands from the CLI, such as `peer channel fetch` in the e2e_cli example, fail when CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL is not set. This causes the e2e_cli to fail: {code:java} Channel name : mychannel Check orderering service availability...

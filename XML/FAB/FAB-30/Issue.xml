CDATA Story: Developer needs the ability to gain signatures from endorsers as defined by a policy by simulating a transaction without writing to the ledger create, so that they can submit a transaction.  Endorsers simulate tx with state and reply with rw set of all keys that were modified.  A submitter composes a transaction consisting of  header, payload, rw-set  where rw-set is the set containing the state variables that the transaction reads from (read-set) and the state variables that the transaction writes to (write-set). The rw-set is created via transaction execution simulation (not writing to database). This simulation is also done by the endorsers of the transaction to fulfill the endorsement policy of the transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

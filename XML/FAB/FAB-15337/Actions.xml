The deprecate-and-remove - with making sure viable alternatives are available (or new ones introduced) in the deprecating release is safest. Its hard to predict how many members will be affected (and by how much). From past experience it was painful when that happened.  So basically suggest in general we deprecate things in v2 with intent to remove in v3. This will also give opportunity to bake in new alternatives.  Having said that it may be ok to remove the most problematic things in v2 if it'll help addition of new features.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like to be able to update a consortium org's, consortiums group's, and consortium group's configuration by adding or removing policies.     *Acceptance*  I should be able to call this function to modify a config transaction and then process further configuration updates on the modified config transaction. The examples test should be updated to demonstrate usage of this feature.     ></description> </Issue>

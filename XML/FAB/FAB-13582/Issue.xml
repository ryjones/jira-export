CDATA The current runtime model of a chaincode is that it has to be in a sandbox (Docker container) since it is co-located in the hosting peer's environment. To sandbox, the hosting peer builds the chaincode Docker image and launches the container during the instantiate transaction. This model causes nonconformance with standard security practices in certain production deployments: # Endorsing peers must run in privileged mode to build and launch Docker chaincode images # Chaincode container can’t be provisioned and scaled by cloud native tools (eg K8s) # Chaincode package contains source code that can be confidential due to sensitive business logic # Dependence on peer to build and launch chaincode which doesn’t work well with CI/CD process  We focus on resolving these issues with 2 phases of development: # We will remove the elevated privilege configuration from the peer container enabling it to be deployed like any typical microservices in cloud environment # We will enable auto provisioning and elastic scaling of chaincode container with cloud native tools     ></description> </Issue>

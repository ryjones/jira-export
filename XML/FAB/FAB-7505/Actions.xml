CDATA Hey  ~nasht00 , happened to see your suggestoin around "chaincode calls another chaincode"...  I did some test on my local, deploying and instantiating the chaincodes with different chaincode NAME on the peer. So on peerA, we have mycc1 and mycc2.  mycc1 & mycc2 cannot share the value for the same key, they are totally seperate.  However, by usingÂ InvokeChaincode in mycc2, mycc2 can successfully query the value from mycc1, can invoke the same key as well..  ></body> </Action>

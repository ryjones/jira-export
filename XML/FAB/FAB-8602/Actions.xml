CDATA I'm not sure where to find the script which is actually executing this, but I suspect that it may need a change as well.  In particular â€“ please add:  {noformat} docker-compose -f docker-compose-e2e.yaml down --volumes --remove-orphans {noformat}  prior to executing the {{docker compose -f docker-compose-e2e.yaml up}}  Or you are likely to experience failures.  CR for fixing up the template pushed:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/18591  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jyellick  We are using this compose file in conjunction with our performance benchmarking test harness (based on the `fabric-node-js` SDK). Folks in MRL (Australia) and ICBI (Singapore) built a wrapper around the SDK to simplify network- and application-launching operations, initially targeted at our use case, but built to be more generic. Here are links to these projects: *  https://github.ibm.com/icbi/fabric-client-wrapper  *  https://github.ibm.com/hlfperf/hfbench-harness-nodejs   I know the `byfn.sh` script doesn't depend on the e2e compose file, as it runs and tests a network using CLI. But the e2e compose is very useful for those of us who want to create a "real" application from scratch.  ></body> </Action>

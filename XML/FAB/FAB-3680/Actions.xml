CDATA From gossip point of view, everything work as designed - peer0 can't pass blocks for channel1, it didn't know about channel1 at all. Solution for this kind of problems is leader election mechanism - it ensures that each channel in each organization has its own leader to connect to ordering service.  I will remove fabric-gossip from defect, because it is not gossip thing at all.  ></body> </Action>

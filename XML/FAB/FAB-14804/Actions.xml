CDATA Actually, we intentionally do not want to do this.  The idea is that each organization needs to inspect any chaincode package (even upgrades) before installing on their peers.  We also do not want to propagate chaincode bytes using any of the peer to peer or channel broadcast mechanisms.  I'll leave this open for now as there might be a way to deal with this via the new lifecycle and future work to actually leverage existing Docker images for chaincode rather than actually building container via the peer.  ></body> </Action>

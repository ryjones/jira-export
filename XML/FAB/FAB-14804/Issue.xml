CDATA If there is a channel that is joined by about 100 peers that are all involved in the endorsement process, every time there is a new version of the chaincode to be deployed, the install chaincode command needs to be invoked against each peer. The Peers may be in data centers of different organizations. Asking each organization to deploy the chaincode individually is cumbersome.Â   There should be a way to make a transaction of a channel such that the chaincode is deployed on all peers that have joined the channel. There is an *instantiate* transaction which launches the chaincode on all peers of a channel. The *deploy* transaction should be similar, with the difference that it would transport the chaincode files to peers but not launch the chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

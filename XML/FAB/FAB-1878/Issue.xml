CDATA Currently only peer which creates the channel got the configuration block written back on the file system to be used in consequent join channel call. Need to add additional cli command so others peers be able to fetch the block to join the channel, this is especially useful for multiple organization setup.  Command will extend/add an ability to the *peer channel* command by adding new *fetch* flag and leverage *-c* key to identify the chain id.  Format to run the new command should be {code} peer channel fetch -c chainID {code}  where *chainID* is the identity of the chain we would like to get the genesis block for.  ></description> </Issue>

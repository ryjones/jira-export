CDATA During event registration (block, chaincode, and rejection events), we are only checking whether the event registration message is properly signed by an identity from the same organization as the peer. As a result, one identity can receive block events (including block data which excludes read/write set) from all channels on the peer.   The following properties are required: 1. event consumer should give interested channel name along with the interested events during registration. (like we do for invoking qscc: peer chaincode query -C "" -n qscc -c '\{"Args": "GetTransactionByID","mychannel","txid" }'  2. event producer should perform channel ACL before accepting the registration request. 3. while sending the events to consumer, need to check channel id and make appropriate decision.  ></description> </Issue>

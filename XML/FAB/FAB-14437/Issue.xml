CDATA Unlike solo and kafka ordering, Raft ordering will not provide acknowledgement to submitting clients that the transaction was ordered. This can cause lost transactions (e.g. if the leader crashes) and will therefore REQUIRE submitting clients to listen for transaction commit events.  Since this is of critical importance, it needs to be documented in multiple places, e.g. conceptual ordering doc, transaction flow doc, samples/tutorials including developing applications doc (commercial paper) and writing your first application (fabcar).  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="44605" issue="29187" author="sheehan" type="comment" body="I think this is likely related to the fact that I ran the build on a system without protoc-gen-go already installed. I think build process installs protoc-gen-go, but I wonder if something was changed such that it looks for protoc-gen-go before it is installed? I likely do not have time to reproduce by tomorrow, so I can close for now and reopen if I encounter the issue again." created="2018-05-17 18:20:13.0" updateauthor="sheehan" updated="2018-05-17 18:20:13.0"/>

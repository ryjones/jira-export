CDATA OS: Ubuntu  Commit: b70b560f9b47dc1a2a6158926472b562b20a9044  Notes: This was a brand new system. I followed the docs, installed Go, cloned Fabric     Steps:  Run  make dist-clean all     Expected: Build should be succcessful     Actual: Failed with  {code:java} make dist-clean all Installing chaintool curl -fL https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/chaintool-1.1.0/hyperledger-fabric-chaintool-1.1.0.jar > .build/bin/chaintool % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 16.4M 100 16.4M 0 0 5616k 0 0:00:03 0:00:03 --:--:-- 5253k chmod +x .build/bin/chaintool Creating .build/goshim.tar.bz2 mkdir -p .build/image/ccenv/payload cp .build/docker/gotools/bin/protoc-gen-go .build/bin/chaintool .build/goshim.tar.bz2 .build/image/ccenv/payload cp: cannot stat '.build/docker/gotools/bin/protoc-gen-go': No such file or directory Makefile:277: recipe for target '.build/image/ccenv/payload' failed make: ***  .build/image/ccenv/payload  Error 1 {code} I ran again and it failed with the same error. I backed up to commit c4c87ee7130649e419f942fd94fdc02ae92e0cb4 thinking that maybe commit 0f5b1850ea8d6080ceac523adf8a530ac3720929 was the cause. The build was successful. I moved back to commit b70b560f9b47dc1a2a6158926472b562b20a9044 and the build now succeeds, even after a `make clean-all` and deleting the .build directory.       ~sykesm  - could you take a quick look at the error to see if it's potentially related to your gotool changes?  ></description> </Issue>

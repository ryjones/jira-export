CDATA In a chaincode calling chaincode scenario, when upgrading the chaincode versions, ensure that the correct versions are being called.  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel named "channel1" When an admin sets up a channel named "channel2"  And an admin builds a chaincode package using path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example04/cmd" with name "ex04" on channel "channel1" And an admin builds a chaincode package using path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd" with name "ex02" on channel "channel2"  And the organization admins install the built "ex04" chaincode package on "channel1" for all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the "ex04" chaincode package on "channel1" for all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel "channel1" And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","Event","1"  on channel "channel1"  And the organization admins install the built "ex02" chaincode package on "channel2" for all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the "ex02" chaincode package on "channel2" for all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel "channel2" And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  on channel "channel2"  When a user queries on the channel "channel2" using chaincode named "ex02" with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 When a user queries on the chaincode named "ex04" with args  "query","Event", "ex02", "a", "channel2"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

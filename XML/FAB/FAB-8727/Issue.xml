CDATA There is an experimental feature in fabric v1.1 done under FAB-3621 which creates ACLs and a new 'resouces tree'.  This resources tree was originally intended to hold other ACLs, like user chaincode ones, as well as handle chaincode lifecycle, define DB indices, etc.  However, because these other features were rejected and abandoned, the value of maintaining a separate resources tree for basic fabric ACLs is questionable.  Instead, the ACLs defined in the resources tree should be moved into the channel config.  Rather than defining each resources as a separate config value, the entire list of ACLs may be defined in a single config value, managed by the standard channel application admins policy.  Migration for customers using the experimental resources tree in v1.1 should be fairly painless.  When they enable the v1.2 application capability, they can include their ACL list as part of the the config update.  ></description> </Issue>

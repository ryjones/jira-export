CDATA Occasionally make unit-test fails with the following signature  {code:java} ... Closing ledger mgmt ledger mgmt closed FAIL: TestExecuteConcurrentInvokes (59.73s) concurrency_test.go:134: Error concurrent query 92(nkpi) Init CSCC .... {code}  Example -  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/5021/consoleFull.  The error is due to failure receiving an expected value (receiving "nil" value instead) when executing queries concurrently.   This could be a problem in the running chaincode (ie, the test case) or somewhere else . But rather than have CI slowed down with periodic failures, will Skip CI for now   ></description> </Issue>

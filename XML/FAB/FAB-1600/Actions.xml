CDATA This was due to timing in handling ChaincodeMessages that were triggered in an async fashion. This actually sporadically manifested in non concurrent CI runs as well.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2203 captures the details and was fixed in http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/5919.  In the spirit of keeping chaincode test time down, will not attempt to resurrect concurrent_test.go  but leave it as Skipped and mark this as Done. Any issues with the concurrency will surely come up in stress tests and we can revisit this (even use concurrent_test.go in that investigation)    ></body> </Action>

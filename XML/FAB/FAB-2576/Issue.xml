CDATA After leader election integration was merged into master there are a few cases where leader election tests failed during CI:  1. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/7859/consoleFull 2. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/7878/consoleFull  Need to take closer look on test and validate whenever failures are false positive or indeed real issues. If first is correct need to harness the test and make sure to minimize/remove false alarms.  ></description> </Issue>

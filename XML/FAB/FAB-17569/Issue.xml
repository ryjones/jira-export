CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like to be able to retrieve existing application, orderer, or consortium org configuration without manually parsing the config transaction so I can persist values I don't want to change when updating an org's configuration.  Â   *Acceptance*  I should be able to call a function for retrieving an application, orderer, or consortium org's configuration that returns a config.Organization. I can then modify fields on the Organization and pass it to an appropriate update organization function to update the org's configuration. The example tests should also be updated to demonstrate usage of this helper.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are two errors that display a false result in the fabric-test smoke tests and the daily tests, This has been happening from some time so I did not mention the commits these fails happen on.  1. The fabric-test smoke tests, and daily tests show false positive results when some tests fail,  https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-test-daily-x86_64/340/  and in some cases  2. the test shows a failed result when proper details are not updated in an xml file which could possibly mean that the respective test failed, but it would be good if a simple error message is displayed in the test results.(Test Results Analyzer) https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-merge-x86_64/265/testReport/TESTS-chaincodes/xml/_failed_to_read_/   {code:java} TESTS-chaincodes.xml. failed-to-read   Failed to read test report file /w/workspace/fabric-test-merge-x86_64/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/regression/smoke/TESTS-chaincodes.xml org.dom4j.DocumentException: Error on line 154 of document  : An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0x1b) was found in the value of attribute "message" and element is "failure".

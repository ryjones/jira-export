CDATA As someone who helped improve the samples version I agree with Chris. Trying to keep the two in sync is going to be an ongoing challenge.  Of course one has to wonder whether we shouldn't remove all examples from fabric and have those only in fabric-samples. I think we should. As things stand, it's as if we started moving in that direction and never completed the move.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So, I added support for Kafka to byfn as a first step but in the meantime a test for private data and idemix was added to e2e and I don't think we really want to have that in byfn. So, I have to admit not to be sure about the direction we should take here.  I could upgrade e2e to be closer to byfn but this still would not leave us with a single consolidated version.  e2e also goes into compiling the binaries if it can find it. That's also something I don't think we want in byfn. Does the CI depend on that feature?  And then we also have fabric-samples/basic-network which is used by fabcar... It would seem desirable to leverage byfn for this as well but basic-network sets up a network with fabric-ca, which isn't used in byfn. Do we care? We can either add fabric-ca to byfn - as an option - or have fabcar not use it. Given that most people want fabric-ca in their network eventually I'm inclined to add support to it.  Anyone with opinions on any of this?  ~ChristopherFerris  ?  Â   ></body> </Action>

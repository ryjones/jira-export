CDATA The fabric-sample first-network tutorial was originally based off of the e2e_cli example.  Over time, the two have diverged.  The e2e now only supports Kafka, the samples only support solo.  The e2e runs the test script directly via the compose file, the samples do it via a docker exec in byfn.sh.  The list goes on.  We should really synchronize these two, so that we don't have to do dual maintenance.  ></description> </Issue>

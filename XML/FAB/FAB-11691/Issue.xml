CDATA If an single query that has an interest in a chaincode is unknown or has any issues, the entire request fails, including other queries.  Could there be a meaningful result in the array of query results that indicates that the chaincode interest has an issue. This defeats the purpose of being able to submit multiple queries at the same time if one of them does not have results and it causes the failure all the other queries. This will force the client code to have to query one at a time for each chaincode(s) and then for config, local peers and channel peers.  ></description> </Issue>

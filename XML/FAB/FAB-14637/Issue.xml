CDATA Currently in state transfer code it waits for response or timeout before re-trying. However if it gets late response from previous round it will trigger next trial w/o actually waiting for neither response nor timeout.   This behavior should be fixed and make state transfer to respect timeout before doing another try.  ></description> </Issue>

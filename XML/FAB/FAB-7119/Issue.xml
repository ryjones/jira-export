CDATA Recent decision: this is NOT a v1.1 feature.  FYI: -Release 1.1 will be delivered with existing 1.0 lifecycle behavior. Target 1.1 Alpha in January. -We do nothing to break clients in 1.1, or otherwise make fixing lifecycle more difficult for ourselves or painful for our users in the future. -Fix a couple relatively minor security bugs in 1.1, which can be done without breaking applications. -Implement the improved endorsement-based lifecycle with multi-sig in 1.2 (or potentially call that release 2.0 to indicate that there are changes).  ></description> </Issue>

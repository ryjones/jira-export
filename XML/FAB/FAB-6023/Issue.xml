CDATA I tested create two marbles in one block - marble3 and marble4.   During validation phase, bulk retrieve had the following keys:  Entering BatchRetrieveDocumentMetadata() keys= lsccmarbles marblesmarble3 lsccmarbles marblesmarble4   Note that lsccmarbles is listed twice.  The same key should not be duplicated in the bulk retrieve.  Better to use a map when building the bulk retrieve during validation to ensure that keys are only added once.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Stumbled upon this while trying to set up a channel between 2 peers. It is possible to create a channel before a peer is running. An error is displayed only when trying to join the channel. ```Error: Error getting endorser client channel: PEER_CONNECTIONERROR - Error trying to connect to local peer: grpc: timed out when dialing```  An error or at least a warning should be generated if a peer is not running when a channel is created.  ></description> </Issue>

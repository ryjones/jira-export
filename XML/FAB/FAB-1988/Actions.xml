CDATA Hi,   The ability of creating a channel is not really related to the fact whenever peer is running or not, since channel created by submitting genesis block to the ordering service. In fact the peer doesn't have to be up and running, moreover later when peer joins the channel ordering service doesn't have to be available.  ></body> </Action>

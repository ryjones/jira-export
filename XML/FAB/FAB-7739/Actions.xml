CDATA  ~suryalnvs  Are you working this as a fabric-quality test issue?  Or are you expecting an orderer developer to look at it?  If the latter, then please assign to component fabric-orderer and then we can ask somebody like  ~jyellick  to look at it.  ></body> </Action>

Yes if we DO set that env var, which means the upgraded v1.1 orderer also uses 0.9, then there is no problem. Yes a simple solution would be to set the min version to 0.9.0.1 by default in v1.1 orderer configuration. This has been troubleshooted (not a real word, but hey, it makes sense here) with Luis, so he is aware of the issue." created="2018-01-19 21:43:13.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-01-19 21:44:25.0"/>

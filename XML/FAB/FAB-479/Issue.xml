CDATA To make state transfer (FAB-472) to work symmetrically for older and the most recent block, the local sbft application needs to receive the most recent block on commit certificate, and not only on a checkpoint certificate.  The reason is that while `A` received a commit certificate, but not a weak checkpoint certificate yet, the out of date `B` may already have observed a checkpoint certificate and ask `A` for a state transfer.  If we deliver on checkpoint, the latest block will not yet be available at `A`'s ledger.  Alternatively, `B` could supply the checkpoint certificate to `A` when requesting state transfer, thereby boosting `A` to obtain a checkpoint certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The code currently has debug log stmt containing the identities. We need to decide whether these should be logged or not and in what condition to log them. Blindly putting them in debug log may causing security/privacy problems.  As propose solution, a different logger for MSP identities will be introduced. This way, logs generated by that logger can be filtered in the case they are found to contains confidential information.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

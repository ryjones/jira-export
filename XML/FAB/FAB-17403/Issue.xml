CDATA Currently the Private Data Collections get defined when instantiating the Chaincode using the "collections-config" option, e.g.   _--collections-config "/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/config/private-data-collections.json"_   This implies, that you have to reinstantiate the Chaincode every time you make a change to the Private Data Collections Definition.  The goal is to decouple the Private Data Collections from the Chaincode instantiation, so that you can dynamically add, remove and update Private Data Collections without having to reinstantiate the Chaincode.  Therefore, I suggest three new SDK methods: * addPrivateDataCollection * updatePrivateDataCollection * removePrivateDataCollection        ></description> </Issue>

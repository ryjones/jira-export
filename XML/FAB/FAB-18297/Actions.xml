CDATA  ~nkl199  , I realize it may be large because this is a benchmark test, but any chance you could provide the last minute or so of the couchdb log and the peer log, with debug set as: {code:java} FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC=info:couchdb=debug{code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~nkl199  Nil is returned if the key does not exist in state database yet. Perhaps that could explain it? Does the chaincode check for nil response like in this sample:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go/chaincode/smartcontract.go#L81-L83      ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have done a couple of tests and verified that the retry logic that handles requests for couchdb works as expected. # 1st attempt returned 500 error and  2nd attempt (retry) returned 200 OK response. In this case, 2nd attempt was successful and chaincode got correct response. # all retries returned 500 error. In this case, the handle request code propagated the error to the chaincode (expected behavior)  {quote}Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"Failed to get marble: GET_STATE failed: transaction ID: df4a81f361d2f3d16f57d2e92cf049242161ccbc5df6bf15eab5956703a2ca0c: error handling CouchDB request. Error:fake couchdb error, Status Code:500, Reason:fake couchdb reason" {quote} For the reported problem, peer log had only 1 attempt `Attempt 1 of 4` which means that the 2nd attempt didn't return 500 error. A previous comment has requested for couchdb log and peer log, which could be helpful.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A Solo ordering node offers no benefits over a single node Raft ordering node. Raft is the best practice for Fabric v2.0, and should be the only option in the BYFN sample going forwards. This task will remove Solo from BYFN.  Any users wishing to see how to configure Solo - support is not being removed AFAIK - should consult previous tagged versions of the BYFN sample to see how it was done previously.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi!  I'm testing the node chaincode development with `chaincode-docker-devmode` tag `v1.1.0-preview` and latest master after some fight with the docker images (on the docs the curl for the v1.1.0-preview is outdated, the good one is ->  https://goo.gl/6xS3cd  ).  After fixing this i'm getting a panic on the peer execution that i think is the same problem as happened with  #--FAB-6969--.  In the case of  chaincode-docker-development the certs are already generated and no config files are supplied, so i'm not sure about  the config to regenerate the certs.     Edit: According to  https://certlogik.com/decoder/  the expired certs are `admincert/admincert.pem` and `signcert/peer.pem`  which had expired on Nov 11th  ></description> </Issue>

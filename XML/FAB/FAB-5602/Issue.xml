CDATA Enable the ability to specify the filename of the block generated by the {{peer channel create}} command  Currently, there is no option to specify the location or name of the generated genesis block when running the  {{peer channel create}} command. Instead, the block is simply generated in the current working directory and named {{$CHANNEL_ID.block.}}.  It would be useful when writing scripts if the block output file name could be specified. For example, I might want it generated into a temporary directory.  ></description> </Issue>

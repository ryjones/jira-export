CDATA Configuration elements that contains path relative to core.yaml may not be processed correctly.  Example: {code} 	viper.Set("operations.tls.cert.file", "test/tls/cert/file") 	viper.Set("operations.tls.key.file", "test/tls/key/file") {code}  As these are relative paths, when the config structure is populated, the config fields should contain the absolute path to the key and cert files as calculated relative to the configuration directory. As coded today, these will be relative to the current working directory.  ></description> </Issue>

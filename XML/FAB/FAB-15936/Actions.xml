CDATA There has been a breaking change in Commit API in 1.4.2 for supporting rollback feature  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/f57b9520a56104504decfbf4a64d9ce5712ed557/core/ledger/ledger_interface.go#L81 (on 1.4.2) https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/d614a619a9dd2ef19a732da0e0ea9f002a3498f1/core/ledger/ledger_interface.go#L124 (on master)  If we make this change in LTE to make it run on 1.4.2, it will start failing on master. So, it would have to wait till we port rollback CRs to master.  CC:  ~Senthil1 ,  ~denyeart   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="61743" issue="41103" author="scottz" type="comment" body=" ~manish-sethi  The test is failing in the daily 1.4.2 tests. Not failing in master yet.  Can you merge a fix for LTE on our release-1.4 branch of fabric-test repo, and wait to prop to master until when you port rollback feature to master?" created="2019-07-12 19:41:23.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-07-12 19:42:10.0"/>

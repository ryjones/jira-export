CDATA Currently the cryptogen tools can only support to generate all the crypto files from the specific crypto-config.yaml which contains all the pre-defined Orgs, Orderers, Peers and Users.  If we want to dynamically add a new orderer/peer/user in a blockchain network, we need to generate the crypto files firstly.  So the cryptogen tools should support to generate crypto files for a new orderer/peer/userÂ and the certificate signed by existing root certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently Policies may be implicit or explicit.  For explicit policies, which require specific network members to approve a policy change, it's possible for a policy to get to get in a state where it can never be satisfied because a member required to approve the policy has left the channel or consortium.  For example a policy is set up such that any channel modification requires user1 and user2 to approve.  user2 leaves the channel or consortium which is approved by both user1 and user2.  The next time user1 attempts to modify the channel, the transaction will fail because user2 is no longer a member of the channel but is listed in the policy.  One way to fix this is to have the orderer reject any config updates that result in policies referencing orgs that no longer exist.  So in the case I listed above, the policy change to remove user2 from the channel or consortium would have been rejected by the orderer since it would result in an invalid policy.  The reason for the rejection should be clearly specified.  ></description> </Issue>

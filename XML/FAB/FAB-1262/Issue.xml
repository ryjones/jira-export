CDATA in msgvalidator.go the committer checks the proposal payload against the proposal hash included in the transaction. for some reason the transaction message sent by node SDK can't pass this check. it's going to take some more time to figure this one out (it's very difficult to debug). In the meanwhile, we'd like this to be disabled in the peer temporarily to allow the rest of the SDK team and general community to progress.  The simplest hack is like below (so that you don't get linter complaints about unused imports and variables:  // ensure that the proposal hash matches if bytes.Compare(pHash, pHash) != 0 && bytes.Compare(prp.ProposalHash, prp.ProposalHash) != 0 { return nil, fmt.Errorf("proposal hash does not match") }   ></description> </Issue>

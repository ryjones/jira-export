CDATA {quote}and now we would expect for the orderer to send the block to the peers. _{{peer0.org1.example.com}}_ should not receive the block {quote} So this isn't true. Peers can receive blocks via gossip from one another.  The problem here is - a peer can be a leader but doesn't relinquish its leadership when it can't connect to the ordering service.  A way to solve this would be to just make the leader election module "give up" *for a certain amount of time* if the orderer isn't reachable *and if the given peer is a leader*. If the orderer is unreachable for all peers - we would expect the first leader to give up, then the second to give up, and so on and so forth in a rotating fashion until the ordering service would be reachable again.      ~C0rWin    ~gennadyl    Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Git commit id: a39904a310294b7cbd220157178d3c5e1c143e52  I've followed the instructions at  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html   But I use the binaries and dockers that resulted from building from the sources. I don't use the downloaded tools.  The orderer stops almost immediately because it does not succeed to build the system channel. The orderer logs are attached. The orderer.block generated by configtxgen is attached too, as well as its json representation and the docker-compose yaml and orderer.yaml.  I've checked the sources. The error "No system chain found" occurs because multiLedger.systemChannelID is empty in NewManagerImpl in orderer/multichain/manager.go. This, in turn, occurs if the execution flow never enters the if-branch of the ledgerResources.ConsortiumsConfig() condition inside the for loop in NewManagerImpl.  From what I could trace, ledgerResources.ConsortiumsConfig() is non-nil only if ChannelConfig.Validate initialises it.  I suppose the cause of the error is that the configtx.yaml of e2e contains no consortia section.        ></description> </Issue>

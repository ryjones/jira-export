CDATA If you tried to work with the `configtx.yaml` included in the tarball referenced in the instructions last week, that would fail. The tarball referred to alpha-1, which doesn't have the concept of consortiums.  The master (from which you built your images) does have the concept of consortiums, and examples/e2e_cli/configtx.yaml was updated accordingly all along.  So it's not clear from your description, but my best guess is that you used updated binaries and an outdated configtx.yaml.  Note that since we updated the getting started guide to alpha-2 earlier this week, the tarball that is now referenced in the guide includes a configtx.yaml that does have consortiums so you should be good to go.  If the issue persists, please update with more details.  Otherwise, let's close.  ></body> </Action>

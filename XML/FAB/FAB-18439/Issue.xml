CDATA The channel config does basic well-formed-ness checks, but notably it does not ensure that for instance policies can be satisfied, or that the orderers are able to satisfy block validation policy, etc.  We've see these failures crop up from time to time in the assorted support channels, and although most users seem to steer clear of policy changes away from the defaults in the channel configuration, those who dabble there often run into problems.  This story is to cover adding a config update preprocessing step to the orderers to ensure that prior to getting to the necessarily deterministic and slimmer config update processing that all nodes do, that we do our best to help users not submit config updates that are likely to cripple the system.  Of course a malicious orderer could skip these prechecks, and we do not want to make them a part of the validation path, but, it could increase usability greatly.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Rollback: Reset all channels (2 channels) to genesis block for a peer in fabric network while traffic is running  Â   *Steps:* # Launch a fabric network with 2 orderers(1 ordererorg), 2 peers(1 org) and CouchDB as database # Create 2 channels, join peers to both the channels, install and instantiate chaincode and start sending the traffic # After some time, take down the network # Launch fabric tools container with peer node reset # It will reset to the genesis block by removing all the blocks in the peer2 ledger # Delete the fabric-tools pod and relaunch the network  *Observations:* # Peer2 will starts pulling the blocks starting from block 1 in both the channels  ></description> </Issue>

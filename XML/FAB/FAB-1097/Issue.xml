CDATA Currently the sbft orderer backend will block if the channel to a peer is full.  This can be exploited by a byzantine network or byzantine peers.  The backend should disconnect the peer when its channel fills up.  The channel capacity needs to be selected so that this happens only under adverse conditions and not during normal operation.  ></description> </Issue>

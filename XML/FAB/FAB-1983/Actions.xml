CDATA Initially, the blockchain was being hased using the SHA3 Shake256 algorithm.  There were some problems with this, and so we had to move back to SHA256.  At the time, we adding a 'HashingAlgorithm' to the channel config so that we could differentiate between these two hash types.  However, we never got around to allowing you to switch it.  So, for a concrete plan, we need to remove references to the {{Block.Hash()}} method, and instead either inject a hashing algorithm via a call like {{Block.Hash(AlgorithmImpl)}} or we need to supply a "BlockHasher" via the channel config which accepts a block and returns a hash.  Either way, this would actually go a long ways towards making our builds faster, as it would prevent our protos from having to import the whole crypto suite as they do today.  ></body> </Action>

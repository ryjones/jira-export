CDATA Per FAB-1700 and FAB-1699, the chain hashing parameters are now included in the chain configuration.  However, for the v1 release it was not practical to actually utilize these values, so instead they are required at a fixed size until they can be implemented.  The chainconfig.Descriptor carries these values, but no one is currently consuming them.  This additionally includes implementing a Merkle tree for the block data structure.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Provide an approach that allows a peer to periodically check the integrity of its ledger by walking through the blockchain.  Additionally, an option to check integrity across peers, for example to verify that all the block hashes and block commit hashes are the same across two or more peers. This could be as simple as writing the hashes to a file for an admin to compare, or perhaps something more sophisticated that pulls blocks from peers and compares them.  ></description> </Issue>

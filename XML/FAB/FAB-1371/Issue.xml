CDATA In Gossip we have 2 types of entities that are sent around: 1) Entities that never change after their creation, like blocks and certificates 2) Entities that change with time, like AliveMessages (contain timestamp, that changes on a timely basis) and StateInfo (contains both timestamp and metadata what encapsulate block sequence number that change)  I did some work to generalize the pull mechanism for type-I entities: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1292 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3023/  I think it's a good idea to consolidate the mechanism that are used for type-II entities into a single mechanism.  Basically the mechanism is very simple and roughly goes like this: A peer selects periodically a set of remote peers and sends them a request for a snapshot of all their known entities.  It gets back a full snapshot of all entities.  Note: any work should *not* be started on this until multi-channel support in gossip is finished, as it touches the same files.  ></description> </Issue>

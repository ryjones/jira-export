CDATA FAB-17303 set a default dissemination policy for implicit collections of requiredPeerCount=0 and maxPeerCount=1. The intent was for this default to apply to implicit collections of the peer's own org. However it is being applied for other org's implicit collection as well.  Since implicit org-specific collections have an endorsement policy of the organization itself, the owning organization should manage the dissemination. There is no need for peers of other organizations to disseminate. That is, if org1 and org2 both endorse a write to org1 implicit collection as part of a larger transaction, only the org1 peer should disseminate the private data.  This work item will suppress the peer's private data dissemination for other organization's implicit collections.  ></description> </Issue>

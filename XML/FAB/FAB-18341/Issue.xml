CDATA When the orderer section of the deployment guide is merged, one of the purposes of this doc: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/raft_configuration.html  Will be superseded by it.   This Raft configuration doc does a few things other than talk about initial orderer parameters (which is the limit of the scope of the deployment guide), however. It also talks about: * Channel configuration parameters relevant to the ordering service. * Adding a new node to an ordering service. * Certificate rotation. * Hidden parameters.  I would suggest that, long term, the process for adding a node to an ordering service should be its own tutorial, and that likewise rotating certificates is worth of a broader operations guide topic talking about more than just ordering nodes.  The hidden parameters and channel config parameters would seem to belong in a reference topic.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The "*no such file or directory"* error was no good, both from a user perspective, and because it leaked server file system path information (security vulnerability).  It has been changed in FAB-8481 as follows:     *Scenario:* instantiate/upgrade against a non-installed chaincode  *Client error message received in 1.1:* chaincode error (status: 500, message: cannot get package for chaincode (marbles:1))     Other related messages in 1.1 are:     *Scenario:* invoke against a non-instantiated chaincode  *Client error message received in 1.1:* make sure the chaincode marbles has been successfully instantiated and try again: could not find chaincode with name 'marbles' - <nil>     *Scenario:* instantiate/upgrade/invoke against a non-exist channel, or client not a member of channel:  *Client error message received in 1.1:* access denied: channel  myc  creator org  DEFAULT   This message was made intentionally vague, so that clients could detect which channels a peer has joined.  ></body> </Action>

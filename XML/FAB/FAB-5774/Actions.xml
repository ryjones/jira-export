CDATA Status Update  ===========  Discussed this task with  ~MartinC :   ~MartinC : "At the moment there is no dockerfile that exists to run the server in a container inside the docker network using the local version of the code. A similar dockerfile without the npm install accompanied by a version of the tests where the local code was mounted into the container would be a good step for running the tests closer to the expected runtime environment."   ~MartinC : "Local testing can be done using the scripts `tests/fullRun.sh` and `tests/tlsNetworkfullRun.sh` but they run in the local environment which will be inconsistent with the base image hyperledger/fabric-baseos:x86_64-0.4.2 that will likely be used for proper deployment"  The plan (now) is to create a dockerfile that sits inside the codebase (in the `tests` directory) that’s uses the local copy of the code to stand up the fabric-sdk-rest server.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for your work on this  ~jtclark .     As previously discussed, would be good to get an alpine-based dockerfile to stand the REST server up, and from there iterate and add environment var support for port to listen on, etc. Could do with being able to specify a connection profile document to copy in and run against, too, to make it quick to change peer addresses and stand the server up again.  ></body> </Action>

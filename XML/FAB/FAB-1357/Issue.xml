CDATA Chaincode started with Chainname  as part of the per-Proposal context. With multichains, we added "chain" to the context. We also need other structures such as a the Proposal object itself.   In addition to adding the version to the context, the task also needs to reorganize the strucutre holding the context so we don't have to pass many arguments to the chaincode framework functions.   ></description> </Issue>

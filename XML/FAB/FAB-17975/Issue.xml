CDATA Today the Node-based PTE acts as our driver for all tests. Now that we have a Go-based PTE we should migrate PTE to an Interop test suite and consume the Go PTE as our defacto test driver.  This story will encapsulate all of the interop test scenarios, as well as the steps to migrating away from Node-PTE being a performance tool, and instead being a suite of test for confirming support for the Node SDK across the chaincodes, fabric and fabric-ca.  Acceptance criteria: A nightly tests performs full interop testing across the entire fabric ecosystem, driven by the Node SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

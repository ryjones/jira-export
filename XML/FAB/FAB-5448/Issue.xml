CDATA When combination of Endorsement, Validation, and Commit processing consistently surpasses a peer's ability to consume , peer memory consumption grows, potentially leading to an out of memory condition. How do we best preserve Peer, minimize pain to the client?     I've attached a spreadsheet showing the result of the run.  I've asked the team to confirm what happens when the peer consumes all available memory since if it keeps running that's not as big of a problem as falling over or getting OOM killed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The chaincode tests are more integration than UT tests (due to historical reasons). This makes them take a lot of time to complete UT. There is many overlapping functions so removing some of them would not take away coverage. Some examples - (1) there's no need for a separate deploy test as chaincode is deployed in many tests.  (2) Http based deploy is not necessary as chaincode package assembly is purely a client side function now (CLI and SDK are "clients").  In this task we will "t.Skip()" tests with a comment explaining rationale for the removal.  ></description> </Issue>

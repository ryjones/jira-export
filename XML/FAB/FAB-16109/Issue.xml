CDATA There is a function 'Wait', in the current VM container API for chaincodes which is to allow the peer to monitor a running chaincode and, on its exit, deregister it from the map of chaincode handlers.  Presently, the externalbuilder implements this as a no-op {{select{ } }} waiting forever, as there is no way to determine the status of the chaincode.  It's unclear whether we want to implement this as a synchronous blocking call like 'Wait' before, or whether we want to use some health check mechanism etc., but if a chaincode terminates abnormally, as it stands today, the externalbuilder will never restart it.  ></description> </Issue>

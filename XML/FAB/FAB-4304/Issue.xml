CDATA There are parts of the yaml that need further explanation then what needs to be in the yaml. We need to put this in the doc, and put a pointer to it in the yaml file. Just a couple examples from the gossip config are:        # Number of times a message is pushed to remote peers {color:#ff0000}Why would someone do > 1? wouldn't there be a retry if there was a failure anyway? Does this mean as I think, where it would push the message multiple times regardless of success?{color}         propagateIterations: 1         # Number of peers selected to push messages to {color:#ff0000}Is there a clever ratio to use based on # of pulls for # of peers in a network? or is this optimal to have the least amount of noise, while best chance of accuracy? Are these random peers that gossip picks or defined?{color}         propagatePeerNum: 3         # Determines frequency of pull phases(unit: second)         pullInterval: 4s         # Number of peers to pull from {color:#ff0000}Is there a clever ratio to use based on # of pulls for # of peers in a network? or is this optimal to have the least amount of noise, while best chance of accuracy? Are these random peers that gossip picks or defined? or the same peers as the push? {color}          pullPeerNum: 3  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fabric currently has the concept of ESCC and theoretically one can associate different ESCCs with chaincode on a per channel basis.  In practice, this is not the case as the endorsement "flow" is actually "hard-wired" and there is really no definition / interface defined for implementing "custom" ESCC.  Ideally we should be able to easily add built-in ESCCs to Fabric and also allow ESCC to be built as plugins.  ></description> </Issue>

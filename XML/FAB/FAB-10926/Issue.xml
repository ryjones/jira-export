CDATA Our lawyers have a specific requirement that our organization's use of Fabric 's Docker images  requires that OSS licenses be included *within* the images and that I be able to provide paths for each image to the OSS licenses on the image.    An admittedly cursory review (assuming 'LICENSE') of the images (excl. NPM as this appears to diligently include package LICENSEs) shows that few LICENSE-named files are included:  {{./opt/go/LICENSE}} {{./opt/go/misc/tour/static/lib/codemirror/LICENSE}} {{./opt/go/src/cmd/vendor/github.com/google/pprof/LICENSE}} {{./opt/go/src/cmd/vendor/github.com/ianlancetaylor/demangle/LICENSE}} {{./usr/local/LICENSE}} {{./usr/share/doc/git/contrib/persistent-https/LICENSE}}     Even for the Hyperledger Fabric components, multi-stage builds remove the sources from the runtime images (including LICENSE).  Request: * Licenses be included in the images (if not already) * Licenses be readily enumerable, i.e. find -name LICENSE * Some affirmation that the images contain definitive lists of OSS licenses  I'm willing to pursue with our attorneys (legally) considered alternatives that are being employed by this community|others.  ></description> </Issue>

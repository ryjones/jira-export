CDATA Hi,  I have successfully instantiated the chaincode for FabCar and I can see all of the peers are up and running. I can also check the docker logs and can see that the sample invoke works and the ledger successfully initializes when the peers are brought up.     However, when I move over to the FabCar application directory (fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript), I am not able to get query.js to run successfully.     I am able to run enrollAdmin and registerUser, but when I run node query.js, I get the following error: {quote}2019-09-03T16:00:10.737Z - error:  Channel.js : TypeError: Incorrectly typed arguments to startBatch 2019-09-03T16:00:10.749Z - error:  Channel.js : TypeError: Incorrectly typed arguments to startBatch 2019-09-03T16:00:10.749Z - error:  Network : _initializeInternalChannel: Unable to initialize channel. Attempted to contact 2 Peers. Last error was TypeError: Incorrectly typed arguments to startBatch Failed to submit transaction: Error: Unable to initialize channel. Attempted to contact 2 Peers. Last error was TypeError: Incorrectly typed arguments to startBatch {quote}    I am able to run the query on the chaincode directly by invoking peer chaincode query in the docker container:    {quote} root@sd-d5d8-da85 javascript # docker exec cli peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n fabcar -c '\{"function":"queryAllCars","Args":  }'  \{"Key":"CAR0","Record":{"color":"blue","docType":"car","make":"Toyota","model":"Prius","owner":"Tomoko"}},\{"Key":"CAR1","Record":{"color":"red","docType":"car","make":"Ford","model":"Mustang","owner":"Brad"}},\{"Key":"CAR2","Record":{"color":"green","docType":"car","make":"Hyundai","model":"Tucson","owner":"Jin Soo"}},\{"Key":"CAR3","Record":{"color":"yellow","docType":"car","make":"Volkswagen","model":"Passat","owner":"Max"}},\{"Key":"CAR4","Record":{"color":"black","docType":"car","make":"Tesla","model":"S","owner":"Adriana"}},\{"Key":"CAR5","Record":{"color":"purple","docType":"car","make":"Peugeot","model":"205","owner":"Michel"}},\{"Key":"CAR6","Record":{"color":"white","docType":"car","make":"Chery","model":"S22L","owner":"Aarav"}},\{"Key":"CAR7","Record":{"color":"violet","docType":"car","make":"Fiat","model":"Punto","owner":"Pari"}},\{"Key":"CAR8","Record":{"color":"indigo","docType":"car","make":"Tata","model":"Nano","owner":"Valeria"}},\{"Key":"CAR9","Record":{"color":"brown","docType":"car","make":"Holden","model":"Barina","owner":"Shotaro"}}    {quote}    It appears to be related to grpc because I the error is coming from its libraries, but I am not sure what/where, and how to resolve it.     *Environment*:  Node: v8.16.0  Go: 1.12.7  Docker: CE 18.09.7  Linux: RHEL 7.6  ></description> </Issue>

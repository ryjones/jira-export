CDATA when processing an install request but the chaincode already exists on the peer, the endorser used to return an HTTP error status that causes the gRPC client to product an error. This is not happening any longer in recent builds.  This is causing the node SDK integration test to fail in a number of test cases that check for failure conditions, such as this one:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-sdk-node-verify-x86_64/1117/console - 02:19:21 not ok 815  Failed to get an error returned :: No Error returned , should have had an error with version already exists   ></description> </Issue>

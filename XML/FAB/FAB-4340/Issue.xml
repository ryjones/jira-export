CDATA I don't understand the reason for this file's existence. Isn't a link to  https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/  somewhere in our Wiki enough?  The text on the file — if the file were to survive for some reason — needs serious revising as well. Formatting, capitalization, and punctuation are all over the place. There are also references to "openchain" and the project is referred to as "hyperledger".  ></description> </Issue>

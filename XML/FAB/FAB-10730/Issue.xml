CDATA The MVCC check follows optimistic locking method, suitable for low conflict transactions. However, for certain transactions where conflicts are high, forcing a transaction to wait or retry to avoid read-write conflicts during validation unnecessarily hinders throughput and makes the application more complex.   In this epic, we propose a new feature to manage the transaction flow to avoid read-write conflicts.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The Orderer OTE test executed well after FAB-8423 was merged.  The OTE tests are failing now as the go version is updated to 1.10, and grpc version too  in fabric(, fabric-ca) master branch.  Updating the fabric-test to the same version could possibly fix this error.  *Build Log*  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Daily/job/fabric-test-daily-x86_64/308/testReport/orderer_ote/perf_orderer/  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently gossip has two messages to request and replicate ledger state, represented as following:  {code} // RemoteStateRequest is used to ask a set of blocks // from a remote peer message RemoteStateRequest { uint64 start_seq_num = 1; uint64 end_seq_num = 2; }  // RemoteStateResponse is used to send a set of blocks // to a remote peer message RemoteStateResponse { repeated Payload payloads = 1; } {code}  Those message has to be extended to reflect the need to replicate private data for underlying transactions in the block.  ></description> </Issue>

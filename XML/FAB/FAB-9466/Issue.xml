CDATA core/config includes functions like GetDevMspDir and AddDevConfigPath that are documented as only appropriate for test yet the mainline production code includedÂ fallbacks to load configuration from the sample configuration in the development tree.  In addition to violating the intent of the AddDevConfigPath function, it resulted in unexpected behavior with misconfigured peers in integration test environments where the GOPATH included the fabric source.  To prevent further confusion, the GOPATH based fallback should be removed from the production code and the dev related functions should be relocated to separate packages that are not intended to be used in production.  ></description> </Issue>

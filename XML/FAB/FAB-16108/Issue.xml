Still, with existing chaincodes, particularly the docker ones, it is possible to stop a chaincode.  This is useful in integration style tests, and, would be nice to have for when a chaincode is no longer referenced in any channels, we could automatically stop it to conserve resources.  For this latter bit, we have seen users who deploy many iterations of a chaincode in development, and resource exhaust their machines as all copies remain running." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2019-07-26 17:15:34.0" updated="2019-11-20 17:52:17.0" resolutiondate="2019-11-20 17:52:17.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="54476"/>

CDATA  ~suryalnvs  Could you please provide more information on where to store these files in LF machines (Consider it as a ububutu machine) and what are the pre-requisties to install and do you suggest any PATH updates or Configuration Updates in CI machines..  So what I understand from the discussion or from this Story description is:  We have to copy the kubeconfig files in *master Jenkins* to kick off the tests on IKS (IBM Kubernetes environment) instead of using LF machines. Is this correct? If possible, could you please provide some Arch. diagram.  FYI  ~tijohnson   ~jwagantall  Need your help here.  ></body> </Action>

We are planning to trigger tests from LF Jenkins but the tests will run on IBM kubernetes cluseter. This is because we are seeing lot of variablity in TPS numbers on  Performance tests.   ~suryalnvs  Will provide KubeConfig file to you in email. Once that done, could you please setup these config files in Jenkins to use them in Daily Jobs to trigger tests on IBM kubernetes cluster.  FYI  ~bmos299      ></body> </Action>

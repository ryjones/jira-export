CDATA I like the application, identity and smart contract icons.  They are clear, and particularly with the smart contract, the multiple lines and ticks make it both seem like a contract and technically represent that a contract has several functions.  Very good.     The flow lines between the App and Network are fine as well, nice and clear.     I'm a little less sure on the oval for the network, but it makes sense as we rounded the corners in our network, so oval is fine.  I think maybe that it doesn't have a defined boundary, in that there's no line around it.  I wonder what a solid, or dashed line around it would look like? Overall though, I'm fine with an oval.     I really don't like the ledger icon.  1) It's 3d, so it's too hard to draw on whiteboards.  2) It doesn't look like a ledger, but a set of blocks.  In a ledger, in common parlance, as well as a blockchain, and especially HLF, there are 2 elements, namely a set of records that correspond to the credits/debits (i.e. transactions) that have occurred, and the current and previous balance at the top and bottom of the page. That was the reason we used something like this:   https://thenounproject.com/term/ledger/   (or the document shape in Powerpoint - becuase it's easy.)      If you wanted to look at the ledger in more detail, then we'd show the two elements - the transaction log - which can be a set of blocks, and the balance (the world state in HLF parlance) as a database.  I've updated the proposal deck to represent these ideas - see chart 20 of this:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-n-iLEM1iXrWk9WWERhaHVyeWc?ths=true   I'm not saying we should use this verbatim, but we need to get the ledger idea across.  Only when users need to dig deeper should they worry about the world state and transaction log.     Hope that makes some sense Sarah.        ></body> </Action>

CDATA Forgot my other comment which was that loosing the user=developer from the diagram does worry me a little, but I'd be prepared to do that as it's implicit, and does appear in the identity, which is quite nice, as it could now represent *any* user's identity.  So all in all, I'm fine with that.     Thanks again, and apols not to include with other comment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I guess my main point is that LEDGERS don't have BLOCKS, they have RECORDS.  The RECORDS that correspond to transactions are stored in a blockchain, as you say, but the RECORDS that correspond to the BALANCE or CURRENT POSITION are stored in the WORLD STATE.     Caps are not to SHOUT but to show CONCEPTS.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA You are right Sarah - we should keep a simple, single image for a LEDGER.  When we need to go deeper, we can talk about the LEDGER.TRANSACTIONLOG or the LEDGER.WORLDSTATE. So my *advice* (FWIW lol) isn't to separate them out, but to do what you're proposing.     To this end, what about a visual that had a LEDGER symbol, with some kind of nod to the fact that it's a Blockchain too?    !image-2017-06-16-17-47-23-825.png|width=141,height=141!  I know it smacks of compromise, but I think both concepts are important.  I'd be happy to leave off the World state database. Might that kind of thing work?     Anyway, just an idea.                                  ></body> </Action>

CDATA just looking at Anthony's icon concept- i think it could work better if it was vertical. The top block would be the newest block. Taking this concept further in other focused and compartmentalized diagrams, you could pair hashes next to the block- similar to how you'd show it in a UI (e.g. BC Explorer, Composer, IBM Blockchain service monitor, etc. ).   As for the diagram- one comment I have is the application is either invoking or querying a smart contract. if we had to over-simplify that i would say the application is interfacing with the smart contract. Second, the green oval is a bit too overwhelming. It overpowers the ledger and smart contract- which should be the focus. We could just have a  simple line or curve to show the barrier and separation without trying to encapsulate the whole network (because the application in truth is only communicating with the peer- not the whole network immediately). Hope that helps.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Oh sure, feel free to play with the idea - it was the idea of showing something simple to draw and keeping a ledger concept and a blockchain concept together.  I agree that vertical might look nicer - you're right it does imply time a little more - the top as newest as you say.     I think *run* a smart contract is simpler than *interfacing with*.     Yes, we need the network not to appear as bold - it might be nice to try, as you suggest to just put a line around it, and remove the shading.      (btw, applications always connect with *something*** - that's the point - we're trying to get across the concept - and that can reveal peers etc later. ** Think about your web application with an IP address.  There is a myriad of structure between you and the application you consume - routers, servers, firewalls, IP sprayers and much, much more - but you need to worry about *none* of from a conceptual POV.  The network designer however....  ></body> </Action>

CDATA # The ledger is cleaner that way than pseudo 3D, so that's good. # Could we try a box around the ledger to show it as having a single form that includes a set of blocks?  It really going to help if we can expand the abstraction to contain world state and blockchain transaction log. # Could we try a more definite line around the Blockchain network # Application developer identity should now just be identity or digital certificate, if the application developer is not going to be shown on the diagram.  (I'm OK with them not being shown.)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA this looks possibly related to the same comm/conn/connection issues as elsewhere. Since gossip uses Send(), there's no guarantee a message goes through. If it gets dropped on the floor at any point, it won't be resent.  Test structure could be better. There are implicit encodings of "chA has height 1, and chB has height 2" but it's not explicitly said, and spread throughout the test.  Given the structure, I don't see any reason why after failing to send a message, gossip would still know to care about sending the message. In a way the test assumes 100% success while sending. Since we're using actual network connections, that is not good.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA The new FilteredBlock will send events for both transactions and configblock updates just like the eventhub.  But there is no type  This means it would just have no transactions. But not sure if that's ideal. Each transaction has a HeaderType in the ChannelHeader.  Should there still be a transaction with they type ?   Or should the the FilteredBlocks just skip sending configBlock updates ?

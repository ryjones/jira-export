CDATA In our search for alternative test coverage for Behave tests that are being deprecated, we found that this Extended Unit Test step is not correct. It passes - but This "Entry" is repeating another one instead of doing what is intended by using an empty tx. Refer to the third "Entry" line in test * It("tracks active transactions"...)* where the test is supposed to be using empty transactionID key: it should use empty string, but does not; see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/chaincode/active_transactions_test.go#L49.  Fix by changing line 49 from {quote}    Entry("empty tx", "chan-1", "tx-1", "chan-1tx-1"), to Entry("empty tx", "chan-1", "", "chan-1"),{quote}  This code is identical in v1.2, v1.3, v1.4, and master branches. We request a solution for this to be delivered in master branch.  ></description> </Issue>

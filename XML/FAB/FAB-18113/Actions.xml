CDATA {quote}From a performance perspective, it would be faster to open all the channel ledgers in parallel so that their state databases could be rebuilt in parallel {quote}  The rebuild is highly I/O intensive so it's not straightforward to conclude that doing this in parallel will result in a performance gain. So, this demands for an experiment to evaluate.  Some additional points that we should consider:  - We need to figure out that in how many situations only statedb rebuild had been helpful. Data format change is one (as we needed in upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0) but other than that, typically, unknown bugs in validation and commit path requires effectively rejoining/resetting the channels.  - In addition, going forward with the snapshot feature, we would allow deleting the data for a channel so problems with one channel would not need dropping the statedb.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When requesting a session from the HSM session cache, if one is not available we attempt to open a new session with the HSM. In this scenario we attempt to open the session 10 times in a row, in a tight loop with no pause between attempts:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/bccsp/pkcs11/pkcs11.go#L93   We should introduce some delay to try to introduce some stable rate when opening the session instead of blasting the HSM with open session attempts.  ></description> </Issue>

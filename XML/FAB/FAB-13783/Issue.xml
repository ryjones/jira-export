CDATA The Cut() function in blockcutter.go emits a block_fill_duration histogram metric.  When ConfigMsg are formed into ConfigBlock, a tentative Cut() is done to clear out pending txs. As the code stands, a data point is emitted even when there is nothing to cut. This data point has a time interval value of inf and shows up as such in Grafana dashboards.  Have observed this with Solo orderer, simple first-network.  With the linked fix, the "inf" values no longer show up in Prometheus/Grafana.  ></description> </Issue>

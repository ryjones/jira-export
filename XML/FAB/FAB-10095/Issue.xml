CDATA There has been recently quite a few new feature additions in ledger for supporting sidedb. This requires some form of extended unit/integration tests in order to verify the data consistency.  We plan to write end to end tests at the ledger interfaces level by simulating and committing transactions for private data and cover following scenarios     - Verify that block commit can tolerate the missing private data     - Verify that block commit does not tolerate hash mismatch of private data with the hash present in the block     - Verify that configHistoryDB gets populated accurately     - Verify that the entries get purged from state and block storage correctly based on BTL configuration for the tuple <channel, chaincode, collection>    This requires simulating - chaincode deploy, chaincode upgrade, and data transactions  ></description> </Issue>

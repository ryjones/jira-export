CDATA in doc  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network/network.html#network-completed  , there is description of`{{It’s also worth noting that S5 can have different implementations on peer nodes P1 and P2 – so long as they implement the same smart contract interface. It means that in principle, S5 could be implemented in GOLANG on peer node P1, and JavaScript on peer node P2!}}`. This implies that we can, e.g., install chaincode S5.v1 in P1 in golang implementation and install chaincode S5.v1 in P1 in Node.js implementation. Then instantiate the chaincode S5.v1. But currently the chaincode's implementation must have same signature to instantiate, otherwise, people may install mal-formed chaincode at specific peer.  Need to fix to make it more clear.  ></description> </Issue>

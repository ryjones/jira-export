CDATA The chaincode shim includes a number of logging operations that do nothing more than write to stderr. The implementation of these logging interfaces is based on op/go-logging - the library we removed from the fabric core in 1.3.  Removing the logging interfaces from the shim would allow us to stop carrying the op-logging dependency and make clear our position that logging from chaincode is the responsibility of a chaincode developer and that there's no magic integration between chaincode and the peer.  This would also allow us to remove additional viper dependencies in the code base.  Chaincode developers that use the logging interfaces would need to adopt their own logging facade and direct output to stdout or stderr as appropriate.  ></description> </Issue>

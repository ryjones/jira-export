CDATA Unit testing chaincode is not specific to Fabric. There are many frameworks in every language, the example you linked is something I wrote using a tool called counterfeiter. I use what are call `go:generate` directives to have Go mock an interface for me. The three mentioned in this file are pretty much all you will need to generate the mocks:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/main/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go/chaincode/smartcontract_test.go#L16   Of course you also need to install counterfeiter:Â https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter  ></body> </Action>

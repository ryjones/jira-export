CDATA When using CouchDB v2.x, peer triggers CouchDB index maintenance based on core.yaml setting: {code:java} # Warm indexes after every N blocks. # This option warms any indexes that have been # deployed to CouchDB after every N blocks. # A value of 1 will warm indexes after every block commit, # to ensure fast selector queries. # Increasing the value may improve write efficiency of peer and CouchDB, # but may degrade query response time. warmIndexesAfterNBlocks: 1 {code} This may not be needed when using CouchDB v3.x, from the CouchDB release notes:  #1910: Automatic background indexing, internally known as ken. This subsystem ensures secondary indexes (such as JavaScript, Mango, and text search) are kept up to date, without requiring an external query to trigger building them. Many configuration parameters are available.  Details in CouchDB docs:  https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.1.1/config/indexbuilds.html#config-index-builds   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Chain MSPs are setup using a chain's genesis block that contains a configuration transaction. Hence, MSPs (or MSP Manager) takes as input a configuration block, and instantiates the MSPs associated to the chain according to the content of the configuration block.  Chain MSPs are re-configured in a similar manner. Re-configuration blocks (containing configuration transactions) are announced through the blockchain. MSPManager Reconfig function would need to take as input such a block, check authorization of the creators of this signatures, and then apply the changes imposed therein.  ></description> </Issue>

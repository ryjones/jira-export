CDATA In the e2e test, after each org joins their peers to the network, they update their anchor peers by creating a new configtx and submitting it to the orderer.  However, this update is done via the 'peer channel create' command, which is very unintuitive.  Because the channel creation mechanism is the same as the update mechanism, it is successful, but reads oddly and is confusing to anyone looking at the e2e example.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When starting a new network in v1.1, after creating a channel, we have been told that a configAdmin for the OrdererOrg must send a capabilities config update to enable capability v1_1 in group /Channel/Application.  I sort of understand why this makes sense for the upgrade scenario, but this seems entirely unnecessary in this situation where we are starting the entire network on v1.1. Why should we require the network operator to enable a v1.1 capability, for every channel they create? If they didn't want v1.1 capabilities, they would not have installed a v1.1 network.  Is there some way to avoid this - maybe with a config parameter in orderer.yaml or configtx.yaml when starting the v1.1 orderer? Please explain.  As a side issue, we should probably document the need to do this when creating a channel in v1.1, and possibly mention it in the upgrade doc  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRYj7UW_3WXW5xCxXFdM5KtoNGmFr5g0HA_tR-8afLc/edit#heading=h.waeh2h8byypm  ></description> </Issue>

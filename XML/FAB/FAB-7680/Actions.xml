CDATA Those other repositories are not used, except within fabric-test/ submodules. We know hyperledger/fabric/ is used when building OTE and LTE, but of course our Makefile already clones and pulls the latest commits for that repo. It is not necessary to do the same for these other repositories, since we only use the submodules (which ARE updated). Therefore this bug is not a bug, and can be closed.  Summary of the tools and the repositories used: * PTE uses fabric-test/fabric-sdk-node/ * ATD uses fabric-test/cello * OTE use fabric/ , for building the OTE go code which depends on other orderer code in the fabric repo, which requires same vendor path * LTE uses fabric/ , for building the LTE tool, which depends on other ledger code in the fabric repo which requires same vendor path * Behave feature tests use protos built in fabric repo and could reference scripts from fabric/e2e and from fabric-samples     ></body> </Action>

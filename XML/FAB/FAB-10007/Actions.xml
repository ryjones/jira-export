CDATA  ~rameshthoomu  Jar location is core/chaincode/platforms/java/testdata/SimpleSample/chaincode.jar Right now it can be totally static, so there is no need to generate it, you can take it as is, in future I will need to rebuild it from time to time, but it is post 1.2 task. Now I have few questions: How I will be able to access it from code? Will it be placed in same folder during build? Now I use it in unit test. Will I be able to get this file locally, to run unit test locally? Thanks    ></body> </Action>

CDATA It has been determined that there is no need to store the JAR files on the nexus repository, so this task is no longer needed. The fabric-chaincode-java ( ~C0rWin ,  ~gennadyl ) developers had a conversation on Rocket.Chat as well as in the following patchset:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20857/   Marking as *INVALID.*        ></body> </Action>

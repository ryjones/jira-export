CDATA In the current code, while committing a block to the ledger, the gossip/coordinator passes the info about private data that could not be fetched. However, this info is limited to the collections that the peer is  eligible (as per the latest collection config) to receive but the gossip could not pull it from other peers - ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/privdata/coordinator.go#L226).  In the current implementation, this information passed on to ledger is not used in any manner by ledger. Though, it's mostly harmless to pass on this info from the gossip to the ledger, still it can cause confusion in the code - primarily because of the names of the structs that are used for this (namely - `MissingPrivateData`) https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/core/ledger/ledger_interface.go#L185  According to the new design, the ledger would maintain a bookkeeping about the missing data about the collections beyond the scope of the latest collection configurations because the peer can be added to the collection at some later point in time as well.  Keeping above in mind, it will be good to remove the above code and delete this struct (`MissingPrivateData`)  from ledge_interface.go  ></description> </Issue>

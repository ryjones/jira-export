CDATA As I look deeper into current cli implementation, a more substantial clean up seems viable, at least in several aspects: * {{CmdFactory}} is more of a collection of clients, instead of factory. It is created for dependency injection, which is not necessary at the top of invocation hierarchy * Too many pkg level vars * More comprehensive UT is needed. Most of UTs only do a sanity check on flags/args, instead of actual behavior of cmd  However, I recall an ongoing effort to redesign cli, at least from fabric playback. So I wonder if this is still worth tackling now?  wdyt?  ~sykesm   ~denyeart   ~wlahti   ></body> </Action>

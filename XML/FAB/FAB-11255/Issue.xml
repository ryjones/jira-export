CDATA I've checked about the official doc about Chaincode. Now I have some questions about the instantiation policy: # Is the instantiation policy to be used for limiting who can install the chaincode?  # Does the instantiation policy have any connection with the chaincode signature?  # Now there're 3 Orgs in the network(Org1, Org2, Org3). If I want to make a limitation that the chaincode could only be installed just by Org1 and Org2. What should my instantiation policy be?  ></description> </Issue>

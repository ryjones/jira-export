CDATA h3. Observed: The raft orderers orderersystemchannel accepted an update to re-add orderer5th (duplicate information) multiple successive times. A new block was added to the orderersystemchannel each time, even though we added identical information (same orderer name, port, etc) each time.  h3. Expected: On the second and subsequent attempts, we expected the config transaction to be rejected.  h3. Attachments and Links: Refer to timestamps from 21:53 - 22:02 when we added orderer5th-ordererorg2 the second and third time.

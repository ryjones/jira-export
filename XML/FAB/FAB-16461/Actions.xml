CDATA  ~troyronda   - I agree with the overall sentiment for sure. I'll have to dig as this might be a duplicate / related to another entry on this subject, but we can just mark the other as a dup if it exists.  I do think that you have WAY too many things being externalized here.  Most of these should never have been imported / used outside of Fabric.  Specifically:  - bccsp - this is just a mess ... I could possibly see some common crypto pkg needing to externally linkable - protoutils - most of these are silly wrappers - msp  - cauthdsl  I'm not sure which subset of ledger structures ... I imagine the ones that show up as return values for chaincode functions and/or via the channel event log (blocks, etc)?  ></body> </Action>

<Issue id="42104" key="FAB-16461" number="16461" project="10002" reporter="troyronda" creator="troyronda" type="10000" summary="Externalize common Fabric Go components" priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-08-28 13:41:17.0" updated="2020-02-21 15:50:17.0" votes="1" watches="4" workflowId="55148"> <description><! CDATA As a Fabric Go SDK maintainer, we would prefer to use an externalized copy of common components rather than copying & modifying the code into the SDK.  We currently have a modified version of Fabric and Fabric CA code in the Go SDK:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/internal/github.com/hyperledger/   From Fabric, the Go SDK uses: * protoutil * BCCSP * msp * discovery client * gossip utilities * cauthdsl * CC Provider structures * ledger structures * common utilities * configtxgen functions * configtxlator functions  Downstream developers of the Go SDK use: * protoutil * cauthdsl * CC provider structures * ledger structures * configtxgen functions * configtxlator functions  Historically (partially due to usage of a copy of the protos â€“ no longer the case as of FABG-899), we have exposed a subset of the modified version of Fabric code in the Go SDK:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric . We would prefer downstream developers use a canonical source rather than rely on a copy.  ></description> </Issue>

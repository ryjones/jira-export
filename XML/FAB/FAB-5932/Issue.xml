CDATA Block/transaction validation in VSCC is as of v1.0.1 sequential and single-threaded. Therefore the transaction validation does not scale with CPU. This implies a performance bottleneck in VSCC, which amounts to about 500-600 tps - on small scale Fabric deployments - where transactions pertain to a simple utxo cryptocurrency application we built on Fabric with a *single* endorsement. This validation bottleneck in those experiments is also an end-to-end throughput bottleneck and, as such, critical.      Fix to this issue would allow parallelized VSCC to scale with CPU (number of peer cores).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA is triggered by    https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/message/6468?p=,,,20,0,0,0::relevance,,%22Read+only+node%22,20,2,0,32507518     Hello,  I want to build blockchain network with two org.  Org1 can read and write block(include stateDB) while Org2 can not write.  Org2 can only recieve data which org1 produced.     I thought  this idea was very simple and there must be some way to do this.  But I can't find it.  I tried with ACL, but when I excluded org2 from writers, Org2 can't even update it's anchor peer.  I found out same question in stackoverflow( +{color:#0066cc}https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55242630/how-to-control-read-and-write-privileges-of-participating-peers-on-hyper-ledger{color}+ )  unfortunately there is no answer.     So, please someone mail me how to to this.  I don't care those rights depends on peer or organazation.     Thanks.         ></body> </Action>

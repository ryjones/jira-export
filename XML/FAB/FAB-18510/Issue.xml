CDATA In the condition of high concurrency of chaincode query, peer will crash after TXSimulator finish SimulateProposal, because queryExecutor's dbItr release db again and the function AddInt32 in Release will panic.   Moreover,  peer has high CPU and memory rate of utilization in the case of high concurrency query.

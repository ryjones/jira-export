CDATA  ~pandrejko   ~bmos299   ~ChristopherFerris   Currently we point to our API reference here:  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/getting_started.html   But I think we could do more to give people some guidance on what to do when they navigate to the godoc site:  https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric   The question is what kind of guidance would be most useful. Perhaps the solution would be to make sure every API has a synopsis on the godoc page? Or perhaps we can give people some information about what they should be looking for (or where certainly commonly used APIs can be found)?        ></body> </Action>

CDATA Investigating how the 'Synopsis' works.  From what I can tell from other Go lang package repositories, the synopsis is optional - some packages have them, many don't.  Some packages have a description at the top of them (just under the import statement) , if the developer provides one, it becomes the synopsis.  I'm not sure it makes sense for ID to try to describe the package - the developer should be doing that.   The list of APIs is by directory -  There could possibly be an opportunity for ID to provide a summary synopsis of the api sets at the folder level.  Something along the lines of "Package provides functions to.... "  It also might be useful in our docs to refer them to the examples in go.  Still investigating..        ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart   Discussed this one some more with Barry and Clayton today. Barry is thinking the API Reference documentation does not belong in this getting started list at all and maybe should even be removed from the docs entirely?  Look at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/getting_started.html  The API Reference section points to this link which is for Fabric developers:  https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric   The thinking here is that consumers of our HyperLedger Fabric doc on the Getting Started page are interested in developing:  1) Client apps (using the SDK)  2) Chaincode  and  would not be interested in using the golang api's to contribute to the Fabric community itself, so we should remove this section entirely.     Your thoughts?        ></body> </Action>

CDATA I agree, 99% of the APIs there are for developers, that paragraph should be moved to contribution section, maybe here:   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/Style-guides/go-style.html#coding-golang      The 1% of interesting APIs for consumers, are the chaincode APIs.  The topic that covers chaincode dev is:   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html#chaincode-api   That paragraph mentions the ChaincodeShimInterface APIs, but has a "Go" link to the wrong location!  It currently points to:   https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStub   It should point to:   https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim#ChaincodeStubInterface   that's where the chaincode APIs are documented.  ></body> </Action>

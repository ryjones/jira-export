CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to call a function for quickly adding or removing consenters from the consenter set of an etcdraft orderer configuration. Currently this is already achievable via fetching the entire orderer configuration and setting a new orderer configuration with the consenters updated, but the addition of these API functions will reduce the need for overriding the entire orderer configuration. Note: removal should match all 4 fields (host port and both certs) to be safe.  *Acceptance*  I can call functions to add and remove consenters from an etcdraft orderer configuration similar to how I can do so for orderer endpoints of an orderer org and anchor peers of application orgs.  ></description> </Issue>

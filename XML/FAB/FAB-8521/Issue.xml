The collection configuration - among other fields - contains a dissemination policy, that is, a policy to define which orgs have access to this collectionâ€™s private data. In the case of local collections, this policy is different at each peer. In particular, given a peer, the policy requires preimage data to be disseminated to other peers of the same org. This task tracks the work required to dynamically create collection configuration for local collections." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-02-25 20:18:48.0" updated="2020-01-22 22:28:07.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:28:07.0" votes="1" watches="4" workflowId="35571"/>

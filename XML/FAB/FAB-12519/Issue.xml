CDATA Currently, orderers pull blocks and only verify the standard signatures on the blocks and the previous hashes, and data hashes.  However - the last config block signatures that were added late, should be validated on their own if: * We want orderers and peers to use them. * We are in a byzantine environment and orderer outputs aren't trusted by default.

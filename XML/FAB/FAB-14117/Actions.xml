CDATA Here's what happened: - a vote split happens (probability is 10% in 2(alive)/3(total) cluster) in newly created {{testchannel}} - cluster would wait for another {{ElectionTimeout}} to start a new round of election - channel-create *fails* because it didn't successfully pulled config block from {{testchannel}} - channel-create makes another attempt to create channel - config version check fails  Will solve this as part of FAB-13920   ~kchristidis  pls see if it's ok to close this  ></body> </Action>

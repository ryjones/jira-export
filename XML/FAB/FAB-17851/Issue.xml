CDATA Some of the fundamental properties of a Blockchain network, are its highly-availability, fault-tolerance and ability to recover from disaster. To that end, one of chief goal as System Test should be to fully test the ability of a Fabric network to recover from minimal and total failure. Our goal should be to assert the expected functionality of the network as we kill off components and allow them to come recover, delete the underlying artifacts of these components, and take them offline for extended periods of time.  This testing will be performed using ChaosKube on a Kubernetes cluster.  ></description> </Issue>

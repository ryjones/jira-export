CDATA TLS makes load balancing for peer and orderer nodes difficult to implement. Without TLS, many transparent load balancing mechanisms just work out of the box, for example Kubernetes services.  It would be beneficial to separate client and cluster facing ports on peers and orderers, so TLS  can be enabled on those ports separately.  Generally client applications and relevant Fabric peers and orderers run in the same trusted environment where TLS is not a security requirement. In contrast. disabling TLS have benefits for scalability and availability.  This is related to FAB-15648  In addition to discussion in that ticket, re-thinking suggests, TLS termination proxies wont help in mixed environments, where some peers/orderers are behind a TLS termination proxy some other not. So, as it's now, in a mixed environment TLS should be enabled network wide which will prevent transparent load balancing.     ></description> </Issue>

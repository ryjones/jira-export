CDATA Solution:{color:#707070} First, sbft used to send change view messages periodically, using a doubling behavior. A timer was started in sendViewChange and a next sendViewChange call was made after some time. It was found out that this was erroneous, and instead of this{color} {color:#333333}a timer should be started when the (non-primary) node supposes that the primary has enough view change messages to send a new view (this happens at 2f+1). The timer waits for some time, giving some time to the primary to send out a new view. If it does not send it and the timer times out, a new `view change` message is sent using the next view number.{color}  ></body> </Action>

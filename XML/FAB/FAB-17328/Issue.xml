CDATA This is a test scenario using fabric-test Operator + PTE: * sbecc_go_2chan_endorse (refer to FAB-11615, and refer to file fabric-test/tools/operator/scripts/operator.sh and function sbecc_go_2chan_endorse) * This exists in current k8s automation suite in kafka network; *ADD it to raft network* (since it is the only current test requiring 2 endorsements, and so it will still be around when we delete kafka tests in 2.x timefame). * Use Operator to launch a small network (minimum 3 orderers, 2 orgs and 2 peers per org), preferably in k8s cluster * Configure using either kafka or raft, couchdb, 2 channels, 2 thrds, sbe golang chaincode * Use PTE to execute invokes, and calculate TPS and confirm all transactions are successful. There should be no panics and no error logs observed.  ></description> </Issue>

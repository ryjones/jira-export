CDATA The gossip components uses the MessageCryptoService interface to verify the validity of ledger blocks and signatures. Ledger blocks carry information about the chain/channel they are related to and so an implementation of MessageCryptoService can access the information related to the specific chain in order to validate a given block.  Standalone signatures refer to GossipMessages that might or might not be chain-dependent. In the case a GossipMessage is chain-dependant, the signature should be verified against the chain MSP. Therefore MessageCryptoService should be enhanced to have a verify signature method that takes in consideration also the channel.   For non-channel related messages, the validation strategy can demand validation against any chain the gossip node belongs to.   ~yacovm   ~ellaki   ~binhn   ~muralisr   ~mastersingh24 , please have your take on this. Thanks all :)   ></description> </Issue>

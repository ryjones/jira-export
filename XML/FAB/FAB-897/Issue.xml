CDATA With removal of PBFT watermarks, sBFT replicas (consenters) now process one batch at the time. For instance, a replica will not process a pre-prepare for seqno n+1 until it has committed (or even weak checkpointed) batch with seqno n. Whereas this is not a performance issue when the network is simulated on a single machine, it is certainly an issue for WAN deployments, with any non-negligible network latency.   To fix this, a new protocol alternative to simplebft (sBFT) is needed (sBFT may stay for use in clusters).   The goal is to implement a BFT protocol based on sBFT with pipelining-enabled replicas, Pipelining involves processing of a BFT protocol message (e.g., pre-prepare, prepare, commit, checkpoint) for batch n+1 as soon as the same message type was processed for batch n. Notice that this does not mean introduction of PBFT watermarks which can create holes. Pipelining does not create holes for a given msg type.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA By default, a majority of orgs may eject any other org from the network.  Once this is done, the majority of orgs could maliciously re-add the old member back into the network, with an MSP definition containing additional CA or Admin certs.  The behavior of a v1.1/v1.0 peer would be to briefly lose connectivity while the config transition was in place, then, resume receiving blocks and adopt the new corrupted MSP config.  At this point, things like endorsement policies could be effectively circumvented by signing with certs issued by the extra CA cert.  This is a relatively low severity problem, because it requires a significant conspiracy of network admins, but it should probably be addressed.  The most obvious way to fix this is to make a peer which sees its org ejected via a config update simply stop processing further on the offending channel.  This poses a bit of a problem if the org is legitimately added back, which could be solved by simply re-joining the peer with the more recent config block.  But, we currently lack this ability in the peer.  ></description> </Issue>

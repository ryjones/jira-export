CDATA The examples in  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network  still use docker compose to stand up a basic network.  Given the move of most deployments to Kubernetes, I believe it would be worth it to provide a sample creating a similar test network but in a kubernetes environment.     While the environment should be very simple, the scripts/docs should cover some simple best practices such as using Kubernetes secrets to store identities, using Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume claims to host data vs local storage, etc.  I do not think we necessarily need to build a full operator to do this, scripts including some best practices should be enough.     Note that there are already several articles around deploying Fabric in Kubernetes, and I also believe cello may have an operator and perhaps other assets that could be investigated.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA hyperledger/fabric-protos-go is maintained by build automation. When a commit is merged into hyperledger/fabric-protos, the generated code is merged into fabric-protos-go.  Given this merge forward processing, pull requests should generally not be made against fabric-protos-go...  The only valid pull requests would be ones like the one required by this task - to setup some sort of metadata for automation or scm. In this case, we'll create the .github/stale.yaml for stable bot to mark PRs as stale very quickly indicating PRs go against fabric-protos, and close them immediately or after 1 day.  Where PR's are needed, we'll have to create a label that is ignored by stalebot and can be applied to a PR before reopening.  ></description> </Issue>

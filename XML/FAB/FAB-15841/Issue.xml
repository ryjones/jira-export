CDATA Manually run a set of system traffic load tests against v1.4.2 in a k8s cluster; select a good cross section covering a variety of functionalities and capabilities. These tests will become part of our Release Test Suite, to be automated in subsequent weeks for future releases.  Background: Many existing system tests use NL to launch network using docker on single host machine (so the existing CI can use them), PTE to drive traffic load of various type, gather report file, and tear down the network. Some tests cannot be run this way, as they require more machine resources and/or monitoring and validation; instead, they can be run in k8s cluster of machines with more CPU and RAM resources.  ></description> </Issue>

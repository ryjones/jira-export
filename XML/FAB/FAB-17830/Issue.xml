CDATA Currently, we create the bytes representation of _updateBatch_ to compute the hash of updateBatch which would be included in the block along with the validation results. The utility for converting a _updateBatch_ to deterministic bytes is present in the _privacyenabledstate_ pkg. However, this utility is used only by the _txmgr_. Hence, we need to move the utility function to _txmgr_ pkg from _privacyenabledstate_ pkg.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Observed hardcoded "go version" is pointing in non fabric or fabric-ca CI jobs. This actually causing problem to build docker images or binaries with the right go version.  Modify the existing logic to pick the go version in fabric-sdk-node, fabric-sdk-java and fabric-samples etc.. repos.  Example: When a patchset triggered on fabric-samples release-1.0 branch, CI script in fabric-samples always pull the fabric release-1.0 and fabric-ca release1.0 branch code, but as the go version is hardcoded as go 1.9.2 it always build on that specific version which is not correct.  Above hardcode step has to remove and this should always fetch the right go version specified in the ci.properties file of each branch.  ></description> </Issue>

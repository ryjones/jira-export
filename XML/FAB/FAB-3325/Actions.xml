CDATA  ~rhegde  some questions  _Peer0 is bounced thus causing user-chaincode container to stop._ how do you do bounce peer0 ?   _Client now tries to Invoke a new Fabric Proposal request thus causing an instantiation failure of the user-chaincode_ Using terms "invoke" and "instantiation failure" for the same request is confusing * are you doing a invoke request or an instantiation request ? * if instantiation request, did you try to install the chaincode  ?  Assuming the steps are * you "bounce" the peer * you send an invoke transaction (without doing an install or instantiate first)  If the above is true and the "bounce" destroys the old container and creates a new one AND you are not persisting ledger or chaincodes by mounting the volume, then that might explain the above error.  Can you give detailed steps of what you are doing and - if you can - share the docker compose files ?  ></body> </Action>

Since we stopped the PEER container (not docker rm) and upon docker start, this definitely gave a new container ID. My understanding this should have persisted the file-system. Is your suggestion - we mount the /var/hyperledger/production of the container?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rhegde  yes, you should mount the container to a local system. If there are many peers using the same local system you'd obviously have different mount points for them.    ~mastersingh24  can you provide some best practice from other envs you dealt with please ?  ></body> </Action>

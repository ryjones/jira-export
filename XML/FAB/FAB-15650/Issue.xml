As the genesis block and the subsequent config update block do not have the txID, a collision would occur at the blockstore index. As we check for duplicate index before creating index for each tx, we skip it currently. We do need to rebuild the index of blockstore once to fix this." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2019-06-07 14:03:18.0" updated="2019-06-08 03:02:32.0" resolutiondate="2019-06-08 03:02:26.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="53393"/>

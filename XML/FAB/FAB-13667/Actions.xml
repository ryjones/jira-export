CDATA The *go mod vendor* command worked great for me. I was able to build and install the chaincode within a *fabric-tools* CLI container. First I had to do *go mod init* before I could vendor the dependencies. Also, for Fabric 1.4 CLI containers the Golang version is 1.11.5.  So as far as I can tell this issue is closeable.  ></body> </Action>

Is there a different work item for v2?  Is there other work that's been done already on this that shows obvious problems to be solved?  ></body> </Action>

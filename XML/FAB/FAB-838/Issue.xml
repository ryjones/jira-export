CDATA The busywork project has failed and should be deprecated:  * I noted in the original HIP that the project would only succeed if the community became involved. Although busywork is used by IBM teams for testing of v0.6 code, to date I am the only person who has ever suggested changes to busywork.  * On multiple occasions busywork has stopped working due to API changes, and as far as I know no-one has ever complained publicly.  * I have no plans to modify busywork to use the SDK interfaces, or to support the V1 architecture.  Although I still believe that the Hyperledger fabric needs comprehensive, system-level stress testing and benchmarking, busywork (at least in its current form) is not the solution. Now that the feature/convergence branch has been merged to master, I propose the following  * Merge appropriate busywork updates from the master branch into the v0.6 branch  * Delete fabric/tools/busywork from the master branch  ></description> </Issue>

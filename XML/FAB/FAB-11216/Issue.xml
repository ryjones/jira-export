CDATA    I made a channel has only one organization 'org1'  -- policies Policies: &Org1Policies   Readers:     Type: Signature     Rule: "OR('ORG1.member')"   Writers:     Type: Signature     Rule: "OR('ORG1.member')"   Admins:     Type: Signature     Rule: "OR('ORG1.admin')"    And there are 2 members, (registered by fabric-ca-client)  member1 => id.type=client, id.affiliation=org1  member2 => id.type=client, id.affiliation=org2  (they have the ca-server admin's cert.pem in msp/admincerts)     Now there are 2 problems.     Problem 1)  First,  enroll member1 and invoke a chaincode of the channel with the its msp path => it's ok  And then,  enroll member2 and invoke a chaincode of the channel with the its msp path => it's also ok !!  Even member2 is not a member of the channel ! but invoking is not failed !     Problem 2)  First,  enroll member2 and invoke a chaincode of the channel with the its msp path => it's fail  (it's right cause member2 is not a member of the channel)  And then,  enroll member1 and invoke a chaincode of the channel with the its msp path => it's also fail !!  After that, every members of the channel can't invoke a chaincode !  For fixing it, enroll ca-admin and update admincerts, then, member1 can invoke it.      in x509 cert. 'Issuer' has OU=org1  (I think it's not matter)     ></description> </Issue>

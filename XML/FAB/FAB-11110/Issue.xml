CDATA It seems most operations work fine.  However if you are using a 1.2 fabric configtxlator and send it a fabric 1.1 *channel update config block*, it cannot parse it.  You will see this error when trying to calculate the delta between the two config block protobuffs:  {code:java} Error occurred encoding update: *common.Config: unknown field "type" in common.Config {code}  sending the same payload to a 1.1 based configtxlator works fine.  *update*: the encoding/decoding and delta calculations are all being sent to a 1.2 configtxlator.  the fabric data in question is a 1.1 fabric channel.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, OSN enabled TLS authentication for the raft communications.  In cases that OSN stays behind firewall/proxy/NATed devices, the published endpoint might not match that in the TLS cert. And the user may not care about it because there's following validation logics to compare the tls cert with those inside the channel config.  Hence we should expose the option to allow skip the hostname checking in the configuration.  With this option enabled, the OSN still requires to leverage the cert matching logic that is hardcoded to compare with the certs inside the channel config.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~G-DazWilkin   For 2.0.0 and beyond we have already moved to Alpine. We also separated the various CC build environments as well to reduce the image sizes. We also moved the 3rd party images (CouchDB, Kafka and ZK) to Debian Stretch as well.  I'm going to mark this is done.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~G-DazWilkin   I should also mention that it's possible to set your own images for both building and running chaincode.  These are all configurable in core.yaml  One other thing to note is that we try to pick base images with multi-arch support as well.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As we decided to keep a single txmgr implementation, we can avoid additional folder depth and reduce a package by moving lockbasedtxmgr to txmgr.   TxStatInfo defined in txmgr is imported and used in both lockbasedtxmgr and validator. If we move the lockbasedtxmgr to txmgr, we will get an import cycle. As TxStatInfo is used by kvledger, metrics, lockbasedtxmgr, and validator, we need to find a suitable place to keep these structs. Only if we can do that, we can move lockbasedtxmgr to txmgr.   ></description> </Issue>

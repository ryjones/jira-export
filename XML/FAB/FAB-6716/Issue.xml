CDATA The orderer already supports the ability to enable / enforce mutual TLS, however it does not support updating the trusted root certificates for clients based on channel membership. Â   In order to accomplish this, a callback needs to be triggered everytime there is a config update and if mutual TLS is required the list of trusted client CAs can be updated by using the capability of the comm.GRPCServer component to dynamically update CAs at runtime.  The channel resource/config manager already supports the ability to invoke callback functions on config updates so all that is required is to create the callback function and hook all of this together.  ></description> </Issue>

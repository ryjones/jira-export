CDATA We publish npm modules from fabric-sdk-node-merge_x86_64 and fabric-chaincode-node-merge-x86_64 CI jobs after verify the release version from the package.json. We follow below approach to release npm modules * publish as unstable if the release is a unstable version * publish as stable if it is a release version (non snapshot)  Merge job fails when a patch is merged on a released version (say from release branch, when we merge a patch on already published release version 1.0.4, Jenkins don't overwrite the existing published versions).. That's the issue we are observing now.  The proposed flow fix this issue, will publish stable npm modules for every release and snapshots on every merge.  ></description> </Issue>

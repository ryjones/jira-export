CDATA I have tested java-Chaincode v0.6 . I merged and tested all methods in fabric-sdk-java about chaincode, most of them are good except setEvent. Satheesh  said that can't merge here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2975 but I really want to test event for sending event to app,especially in v1.0 .But I can't find setEvent solved in v0.6 branch or master branch. In go,chaincode event supported well.  In my opinion,no matter v0.6 or v1.0,we need chaincode event supported.This is the most basic function.  ></description> </Issue>

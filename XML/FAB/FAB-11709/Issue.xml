CDATA Go packages that import packages from  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric  cannot use go1.11 module management capabilities. This is due to an old version of github.com/docker/docker being vendored (which in turn improperly vendors github.com/sirupsen/logrus as github.com/Sirupsen/logrus). This was fixed in docker/docker in July 2017.  To fix: revendor docker/docker at later version and do appropriate functional tests.  Workaround for those who wish to import fabric with go1.11 module functionality prior to this being resolved:   {{go mod init}} {{go get github.com/docker/docker@v0.0.0-20180422163414-57142e89befe}} {{go test ./...}}  {{}}  See  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26208  for more details  ></description> </Issue>

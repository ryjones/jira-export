CDATA The 2nd example implementation seems to me the best direction and the most consistent. That is, we keep the certificate fingerprint list as the white list in the same way that the CRL is kept as a black list. I'll refer to it as the CAL (Certificate Approval List). I don't believe this needs to increase the complexity for the participant, but rather we should provide a CLI way to easily manage the CAL, and while we're at it, to manage the CRL also because there is a lot of synergy between the two. I think it would make sense to create a *fabric-client* CLI to support this management. If fabric-client is written in golang, we could leverage a lot of existing code.  ></body> </Action>

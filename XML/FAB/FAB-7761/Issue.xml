CDATA Create separate testcases for ensuring many parts of the fabric code check for expired certificate and reject it: * Send TX Proposal with an expired cert to the peers for endorsement. * After peers endorse a TX, the cert expires while SDK has it. Broadcast an endorsed TX to the orderer with an expired cert. * After orderer processes it and sends it to kafka, using a long batchtimeout so the cert can expire, then kafka and orderer delivers it with an expired cert to the peers for validation.  And, can the certificates be renewed easily? Investigate and try the process for renewal before expiry and after expiry.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  I noticed something that seems to be an error in a Fabric e-mail content.  When I created a channel, I received an e-mail asking for my approval. However, when the cannel was indeed created I received an e-mail with "Channel Created" as the title, but the e-mail body was identical to the first one (the one asking for approval).  This is a tricky situation, as the user can try to approve a channel already created. I´m sending you a picture attached of both e-mails for your better understanding  ></description> </Issue>

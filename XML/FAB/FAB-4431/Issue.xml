CDATA The orderer multichain consenter API currently does not provide a mechanism to provide feedback for a channel that the consenter is out of sync, or not producing new data for that channel.  This issue is to enhance this API so that Kafka can report this error, and to consume that API in the common {{Deliver}} component.  ></description> </Issue>

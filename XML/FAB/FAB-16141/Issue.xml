CDATA If admin certificate that is stored in the ledger expire, there is no way to update it. This locks all administrative operations in the blockchain.Â   This is edge case, but is very dangerous, because it "locks" the system in the current state. Endorsement and commits will work, but chaincode cannot be upgraded.  Adding some mechanism to update the admin certificate may open security issues, so the best option, in my opinion, is to notify the administrators in some way, lets say 1 month before expiration, so they can add new certificate before the expiration.  ></description> </Issue>

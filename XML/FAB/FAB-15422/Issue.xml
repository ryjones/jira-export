CDATA There are many places throughout fabric where the bccsp.BCCSP interface is referenced but it is only used for hashing and signing.  In these scenarios, we need to reduce the scope of the interfaces down to the minimal requirements.  Futher, in many cases, the golang crypto interfaces can be used yet we have placed a dependency on bccsp.Key. These should be evaluated and replaced as appropriate.  ></description> </Issue>

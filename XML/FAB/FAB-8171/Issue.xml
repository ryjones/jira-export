CDATA "Key Concepts" documentation around orderers.  Some thoughts on how to proceed:  First, we'll have to talk about the role ordering plays in the network. What does "ordering" mean in terms of blocks of transactions? Why is it important that transactions are ordered? Why does the role an orderer plays mean it's best to have a single, yet still distributed, ordering service where this is carried out?  Then I think we should get into some of the administrative aspects. What is an orderer? How orderers are administrated? The purpose of the orderer system channel/consortium. The validation role orderers play.  Then we can get into orderer implementation types. Solo vs Kafka vs Raft.     Of course, this is just a broad outline. Would welcome other suggestions.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The relevant behave tests at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/feature/CouchDB_index.feature which are being deprecated are similar to FAB-7251; they test CouchDB indexing using marbles chaincode using golang with multiple index with 1 or more selectors.  Existing coverage in fabric integration tests is for only 1 channel and 1 index with 3 selectors.  Extend the fabric/integration/ledger tests to include a 2nd index, with 1 or 2 selectors.  (System test will cover the 2-chan scenario.)  ></description> </Issue>

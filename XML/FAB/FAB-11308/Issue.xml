CDATA The new chaincode lifecycle and impending fabtoken work will both require new reserved namespaces in the statedb.  Presently, we have a few reserved names like 'lscc', but which collide with user specifiable names.  In order to reduce confusion, and to be able to safely add new namespaces, we need a new prefix.  Based on discussions with  ~manish-sethi  and  ~mastersingh24  it seems like the best character available is {{+}}.  The expectation is that the new lifecycle will reserve the {{+lifecycle}} namespace, and the pending fabtoken work will get the {{+tokens}} namespace.  ></description> </Issue>

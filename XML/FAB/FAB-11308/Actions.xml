CDATA As I am looking into this, there seems to be some issues in supporting the + char in the couchdb. In the current implementation, the + does not get encoded and in the final URL, it gets replaced by a space char. I tried with manually encoding + as %2B but still couchdb returns an error for this being an invalid name.   ~chris.elder  is looking into this to get more details.     ></body> </Action>

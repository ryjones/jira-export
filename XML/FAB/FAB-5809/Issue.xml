CDATA Since the channelconfig bundle is immutable, but the channel config can change, it's necessary to have an encapsulating structure which retains a reference to the current immutable bundle.  Because the configuration may be referenced by multiple go routines, it's important that access to the reference be synchronized, in this case, through the sync/atomic Load/Store operations.  This CR adds a BundleSoure which retains a reference to a Bundle.  It implements the standard interface for channel configuration, but always references the config through the atomic pointer.  A caller may also request a static version of the bundle, if multiple coherent config calls must be made (such as listing organizations, then looking up their MSP info in the MSP manager).  ></description> </Issue>

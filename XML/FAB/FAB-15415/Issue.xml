CDATA Query for health of fabric network components after launch in NL. Wait for awhile to confirm all responses are successful, before informing the client caller that the launch is finished and network is ready.  Use healthcheck port on the nodes to confirm they are all running.  Such a tool could be useful executed from commandline as a standalone operator action, either for a specific node or for all nodes in the network spec file.  Also, we could (with a different separate testtask) create a testcase to do an install/instantiate/query/queryblock every peer which would be very useful to everyone.  ></description> </Issue>

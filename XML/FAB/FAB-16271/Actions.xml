CDATA Test prints the stacktrace, but passes as it's printing from inside of a recover. Seems to be working as intended from the test comment.  Failing test in log looks like TestSpawnEtcdRaft.

CDATA I have not seen this issue in recent memory and running locally for 50 iterations did not fail.  I did open FAB-17052 to improve a message that was written during the test execution.  ></body> </Action>

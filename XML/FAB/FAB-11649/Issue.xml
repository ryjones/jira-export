CDATA *Add image map support to RST files for images that "drill into" html detail files* h4. See attached doc for details h4. Why add image map support to RST files?  Hyperledger Fabric is a flexible, complex framework with multiple layers of abstraction: business network, application layer, nodes, overlay network, tcp network. The easiest way for users to consume complex systems is to visually abstract them by layer. If a user needs more information on an item, they can drill into it for more detail. Other users don’t need the detail and can read at the current level of abstraction productively.     HTML image maps provide a simple visual abstraction that is intuitively understood by users and simple to implement in the current RST file system. If I see an image map with nodes in a channel, I can “drill down” into an endorser peer for more details on that node and a new HTML page opens next to my current page. I can explore the details on the peer page, close it when I’m done returning to the parent channel page.        ></description> </Issue>

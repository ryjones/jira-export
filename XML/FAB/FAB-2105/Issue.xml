CDATA Because the new configtx format is so much more flexible than the original, we need to make sure that it is locked down to keep people from going crazy with it.  The restrictions can be relaxed as the use cases are made, but initially the goal is to restrict the configuration to a minimal set and loosen from there.  To do this, protos for a simple schema should be defined so that the configtx manager can enforce the restrictive configuration scheme.  ></description> </Issue>

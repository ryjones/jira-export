CDATA The LTE tool is valuable for testing performance impact of changes to specifically the ledger code functions inside the peer. It is a useful developer tool, but that is all. It belongs inside the fabric repo. It is not a system test tool, and does not really belong in fabric-test repo. Clean up the following, on master branch AND in release-1.4 : * +CI+:  Abandon the CI job for fabric-test LTE tests * +CI+: Remove the LTE results from the fabric-test daily results job * +fabric-test+: Remove all references to LTE tool and tests from Makefile and README and regression/daily/ and regression/smoke/. * +fabric-test+: Remove fabric-test/tools/LTE/, and * fabric:  Place LTE tools and test scripts in fabric repository in a ledger test folder. The plan is to keep the tool for developers to use on an as-needed basis, but not run all of the tests as part of any regular CI job. It would make sense to incorporate a small test using LTE (such as that executed in the fabric-test smoke test suite) into fabric integration tests folder in ledger domain, to help ensure the tool is maintained.  ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="15630" key="FAB-3049" number="3049" project="10002" reporter="rjkuro" assignee="nickgaski" creator="rjkuro" type="10004" summary="Wrong peers described in the Getting Started guide" priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-04-08 16:37:03.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:12:08.0" resolutiondate="2017-04-23 13:00:04.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="37929"> <description><! CDATA The new getting started page (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#what-happened-behind-the-scenes) describes:  {quote} PEER0 and PEER3 belong to Org0; PEER1 and PEER2 belong to Org1 {quote}  But similar line exists in examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst, which shows slightly differently:  -  ``PEER0`` and ``PEER1`` belong to Org0; ``PEER2`` and ``PEER3`` belong to Org1  I think the latter is correct because the file examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh sets the Org0MSP for the $1 (=peer) is 0 or 1:   {code} setGlobals () { 	... 	if   $1 -eq 0 -o $1 -eq 1   ; then 		CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org0MSP" 		... 	else 		CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP" ``` {code}  The content of the end-to-end.rst and getting_started.html are almost same.  Probably there was an error in copying the line from end-to-end.rst to source of getting_started.html file.     ></description> </Issue>

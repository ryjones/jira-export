CDATA  ~latitiah  This is supposed to be testing v1.4 fabric, not master. Alpine was put only into master.  Looking at the logs, I noticed we might be pulling fabric from master (mistakenly):  git clone --single-branch -b master https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/fabric /w/workspace/fabric-test-merge-x86_64/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric;  In the fabric-test makefile, we set BRANCH = master. Remember that we had planned to skip the cloning of fabric repo and just pull all images, but that did not work out, so we added back the code to pull fabric. What we did not fix (for this temporary window) was the fact that we clone master (instead of v1.4) version of fabric.    ></body> </Action>

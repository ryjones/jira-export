CDATA The raft orderer uses TLS pinning and compares TLS certificates extracted from the gRPC stream to the ones that are present in the config very frequently, and because of that - it's better to just compare the raw bytes than to make the certificate pass sha256 each time.  Â   Therefore, to reuse ExtractCertificateHashFromContext - we need to split it into 2 methods, 1 that extracts the certificate, and ones that returns the hash of it and calls the first one.  ></description> </Issue>

You're correct that it isn't caused by that CR. Thought I had tried checking out the code at both FAB-12552 and FAB-12816 and run the test but I must have accidentally gone back to master instead.   I'll track this down further and report back.  ></body> </Action>

Caused by  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/27103/,  which changed the behavior of failed installs.  The integration tests would have failed for this CR had it been rebased in the last month before it was merged. I'll push a CR shortly.   ></body> </Action>

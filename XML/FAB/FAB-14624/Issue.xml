<Issue id="38423" key="FAB-14624" number="14624" project="10002" reporter="ales" creator="ales" type="10003" summary="Remove PackageProviderWrapper" description="PackageProviderWrapper is used for tests of the legacy package provider that still require name/version on lookups. In the new lifecycle we have moved away from that to simply supplying a PackageID but this breaks the old code. This struct is used in tests to make the old interface act as the new one. As soon as the old provider disappears (or its functions are aligned with the new interface), this struct should be removed." priority="3" status="10000" created="2019-03-13 14:01:25.0" updated="2019-05-09 12:51:03.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="51926"/>

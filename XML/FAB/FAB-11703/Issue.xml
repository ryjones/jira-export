CDATA The barebones etcd/raft-based chain objects implemented in FAB-11162 and FAB-11163 should be able to communicate with each other to form a cluster. h2. Acceptance Criteria # Elect a leader, where normal transactions can be ordered and cut into blocks # Blocks are consented via underlying etcd/raft cluster # Consented blocks are written into ledger # Upon leader failure or network partition, a follower should be able to step up as leader and perform tasks described in 2 & 3 # If ex-leader rejoins the network, it should step down as follower, purge its blockcutter and stop timer # Stale leader should not be able to propose block due to lagged term  ></description> </Issue>

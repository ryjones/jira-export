CDATA Currently, token transactions are stored using "transaction id + output index" as the state key. As a result, the "ListTokens" call will have to scan the entire "tms" namespace. If there are lots of token transactions in the ledger, this design may cause performance issue.  New Proposal: Add "owner id" to the token transaction keys when stored the state in ledger.

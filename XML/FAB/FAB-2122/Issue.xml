CDATA The deployment payload for golang is expected to contain golang packages under /src.  This is then expanded into $GOPATH within the chaincode execution environment.  However, a malicious guest could technically include anything they want in the tarball, including binaries under /bin or /pkg.  It is not clear if this could be exploited as an attack surface, but its also clearly a gaping hole and not difficult to fix.  Proposal is we should scan the tarball so that it only includes files that match a pattern like  /src/.*\.(go|c|yaml)  ></description> </Issue>

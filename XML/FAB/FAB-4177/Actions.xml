CDATA If this is really a bug with a 7 line code fix, it does not require review-needed votes, per our operating procedures here:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/release_exit_criteria   Therefore I will vote yes.

CDATA This one keeps on failing builds for some strange (and clearly unrelated problems) in the CI.    ~jpatchell , could you hit the rebase button? That sometimes fixes things for me (perhaps picks up a fix?). If still a problem, please post on #fabric-ci and ask someone to have a look at your gerrit item  ></body> </Action>

Ran this tests manually in local machine and observed same failures. if possible could you please rebase this patch set and try again please..

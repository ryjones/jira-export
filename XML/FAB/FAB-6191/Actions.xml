CDATA The *fabric-verify-\{arch\}* jobs all use Docker to run the various tests and since the versions of fabric-baseimage they use have the proper version of Go (i.e.  0.3.2 has Go 1.7.5 and 0.4.x images have Go 1.9) nothing special needs to be done for those jobs.  There are a number of other jobs which use the Go binary which is installed on the slave node itself.  Currently those jobs only run on x86_64 as well.  Jenkins supports injecting properties from files in the actual source repository, but you must use a build step in order to do this.  So we'll introduce a builder macro which will read the properties file and then set the appropriate GOROOT and add GOROOT/bin to the PATH. We'll then add this builder to all of the jobs which at some point call the Go binary on the slave node.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The peer has many components that all derive their startup logging levels from  peer/core.yaml | https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L33  and sometimes a developer/administrator is interested in running the peer with all sub-component log levels set to DEBUG/INFO but a certain sub-component to be silenced (set to WARNING/ERROR).  I think it could be good if you could also set in the peer/core.yaml a logging level per sub-component which if defined, would override the log level all sub-components inherit from.  ></description> </Issue>

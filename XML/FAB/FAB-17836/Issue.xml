<Issue id="44993" key="FAB-17836" number="17836" project="10002" reporter="caod" assignee="tsharris" creator="caod" type="10004" summary="Discrepancy between configtx package and sampleconfig/configtx.yaml" description="Although technically an orderer org should not have anchor peers defined, the sampleconfig/configtx.yaml has both orderer endpoints and anchor peers defined for the `SampleOrg` org. This works fine when creating a system channel with configtxgen because there are separate functions for NewOrdererOrg and NewApplicationOrg, but because the configtx package shares the same function `newOrgConfigGroup` there should be some check to ensure that when we are creating a new orderer org it definitely does not add anchor peers even if theyre specified in the case of the sample config, and vice versa no orderer endpoints if creating a new application org even if also specified (again like in the sample config). Implementation details for whether we want separate functions or a flag passed is up to the implementer." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-05-04 20:09:07.0" updated="2020-05-06 19:53:20.0" resolutiondate="2020-05-06 19:53:20.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="58896" archived="N"/>

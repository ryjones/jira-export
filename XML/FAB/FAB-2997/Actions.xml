CDATA I'm preparing 3 change sets to fix this issue: 1) prevent system security sensitive system chaincodes from being invoked directly through a proposal 2) prevent system security sensitive system chaincodes from being invoked through a cc2cc invocation 3) expose through the shim a method that reveals to the chaincode developer which path was followed for that invocation - direct invocation through a proposal, cc2cc, internal invocation from the peer; this way, the chaincode developer may choose to only allow certain kinds of invocation   ~muralisr   ~binhn : any feedback?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ales  ~ellaki  ~muralisr  ~binhn , I think this FAB is really critic and must be addressed asap.  Point 3 is especially important for also for scc. For example, during invocation, cc2cc, etc, the peer invokes system chaincodes like LCCC to get information about the chaincode. In this case, LCCC should be able to recognize that the call is an internal one (coming from the peer) and it should just process it.    ~ales , thanks for taking care of this.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi CRs addressing items (1) and (2) are there:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7853/ https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7849/  I think the first two parts are important. The third one I believe we can add later without impacting the tests of the entire infrastructure?  ~binhn   ~muralisr   ~ales   ~adc , thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So, after discussing with  ~ales , we both agree that item (3) can be added later, and is associated more to the application level access control. Therefore this bit makes sense to be added with the invocation library post V1.0.   Unless there are any objections, I will mark this item as "done" and create a new issue referring to work item (3) with fix-version v1.1.   ~binhn   ~muralisr  would you be fine with this?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="22661" issue="15577" author="muralisr" type="comment" body=" ~ellaki   unless we have specific need, keeping is simple and not give too many choices makes sense. Plus 3 is quite invasive at this stage IMO. Better leave it for investigation in 1.1 I think. In 1.0, if user doesn&apos;t want SCC to be accessed, he flags it as as such wholesale." created="2017-04-18 21:27:35.0" updateauthor="muralisr" updated="2017-04-18 21:27:35.0"/>

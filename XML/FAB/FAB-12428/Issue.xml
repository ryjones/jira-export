CDATA * We need more samples for a beginner.     BYFN is a very good sample.   I upgraded BYFN into Multi-Channel Network Sample, so that they understand Fabric more easily.     In Multi-Channel Network, I removed eyfn( org3-artifacts ).  While I make this sample, I think I understand a bit more about Fabric.  I wish other beginners are too through this sample.    * Multi Channel Network (MCN) ** This is Multi-Channel Network based on BYFN. * There are 4 Orgs( org1, org2, org3, org4 ) ** Each org has one peer except org3 has two peers( peer0.org3 and peer1.org3 ). * There are 2 Private Channels. Each channel consists of org's peers like bellow. ** Channel1( peer0.org1, peer0.org2, peer0.org3 ) ** Channel2( peer1.org3, peer0.org4 )        ps: This is my first contribution. If I make a mistake, please let me know.     Thank you.  ></description> </Issue>

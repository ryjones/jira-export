CDATA I found I had to update a lot of packages in vendor to be compatible with the latest gogo/protobuf.  Taking this on as my first issue, seems a good way to learn the tech stack.  I have it compiling and am in the process of testing: https://github.com/RandyMoore/fabric  Once the tests are passing I'll submit for review.  If these changes seem off base guidance would be appreciated :)    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Putting back to TODO and Unassigned - BDD tests are broken, I'm getting something similar to FAB-2733. I'll check back later and pick this up again if the BDD become fixed.  ></body> </Action>

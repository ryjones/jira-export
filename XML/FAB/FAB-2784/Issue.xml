CDATA From Manish:  https://github.com/gogo/protobuf acts as a protoc plugin and generates the message specific code for fast serialization.  Appears to be 2x as fast as plain protoc.  Inside `proto.Marshal()` function in golang it first checks that whether the `obj` implements `Marshal()` function and if yes then it simply invokes it.  So, we just need to install `https://github.com/gogo/protobuf` into vagrant and change in the `make protos` command in our build (from `protoc --go_out=...` ` protoc --gofast_out ...`).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Prior to refactor, "notifyDuringStartup" passed a bool value back to chaincode support that indicated whether or not the ready message was successfully sent to the chaincode.Â As part of the existing refactor, a simple chan struct\{} is used to for readiness notification back.  The chan struct\{} approach accurately models a one-shot release but loses the nuance of passing a message back.  We need to revisit whether we want to restore the existing semantic or rely on the start timeout to capture this scenario.  ></description> </Issue>

The orderer admins of each entity get on the same call with the bootstrapAdmin for all we know, and they agree that they will roll with a 4-node PBFT network, where each entity has a node. The bootstrapAdmin says "I got this", sets the corresponding values to the genesis block (using the process you outline in FAB-665), and then, with the work covered in FAB-666 this block is communicated to the orderer administrators, who inspect it (FAB-667) to make sure everything looks good.  What will the deliverable of this story be?  ></body> </Action>

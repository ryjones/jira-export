CDATA There seems to be general network instability in the Jenkins environment which does not exhibit itself that often.  It seems to show itself as one of many things * A panic in the unit tests that a request took longer than 60 seconds (see FAB-101) * Not being able to download a copy of the source code ( fabric-merge-168|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/168 ,  fabric-verify-1065|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-x86_64/1065  and  fabric-merge-143|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/143 ) * Failing to push images to docker-hub ( fabric-merge-153|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/153 ) * Gradle failing to download ( fabric-merge-162|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/162  and  fabric-verify-behave-2|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/2 )  A few of the behave tests also exhibit what seems to be general network issues: * HTTP GET timing out ( fabric-verify-behave-3|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/3 ) * Containers taking much longer than normal to startup and timing out ( fabric-verify-behave-19|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-verify-behave-x86_64/19/ )  ></description> </Issue>

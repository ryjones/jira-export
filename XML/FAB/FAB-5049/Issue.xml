CDATA {color:#444444} Need system test to test extreme large transactions end-to-end.{color}  {color:#444444} For example a transaction with a huge key/value, and a transaction with a huge amount of keys/values? Need to identify and document all the config settings required to get large transactions through the system. I know in CouchDB there is max_document_size setting that will need to be updated (default is 16MB in CouchDB config ini files). There is no known max in goleveldb. I expect there will be config settings required at each of the transfer and storage points along the way (e.g. gRPC, kafka).{color}  {color:#444444}Note that grpc is currently limited to 100MB based on settings hardcoded here:{color}  {color:#444444} https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/comm/config.go#L23-L24 {color}  {color:#444444}Need to investigate making this configurable.{color}  ></description> </Issue>

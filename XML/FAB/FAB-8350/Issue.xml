CDATA The peer's admin server shares the listener with the endorser one.     This doesn't make much sense because the admin service might be deployed in a setup where it should only be accessible to peer administrators and not to clients, and also  - mutual TLS is used, then it also accepts TLS client certificates issued by CAs of other organizations which share a channel with the peer's organization.  ></description> </Issue>

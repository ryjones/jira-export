We need better abstraction #   when people talk about plugin database, they actual think every thing is in the database (not just state) so that backup/recovery would be taken care of  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~binhn  Yes, you are right. However, in the current implementation I did not touch couch code and hence kvledger code because, as of now couch implementation was half baked and requires a separate effort altogether. I had mainly focused on organizing the code in terms of interface and moving the code related to leveldb and other aspects behind those interfaces. The intention was that some one can cleanup couch code in those lines (because, it was mostly a copy-paste of leveldb based code so it should be easy for some one to cleanup looking at the new structure.) And then finally, clean-up the kvledger.  Do you prefer to see all in a single commit?  ></body> </Action>

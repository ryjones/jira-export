CDATA Currently Network Launcher (`hyperledger/fabric-test/tools/NL`) allows the user to specify a network (to launch) purely in numerical terms. Organization names are set to `org1`, `org2`, etc. and MSP IDs are set to `PeerOrg1`, `PeerOrg2`, etc.  Â   But such networks won't work to benchmark chaincode that has organization and MSP names embedded in its logic. Therefore, we need a feature whereby a chaincode designer can specify custom organization and MSP names, and have NL create channel artifacts, keys and certificates, and a docker-compose file with the user-specified names.  ></description> </Issue>

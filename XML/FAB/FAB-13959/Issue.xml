CDATA An admin from an org does not install - peers from that org can't execute (same as if there was no chaincode installed on a channel)  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin builds chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd" as version "2" with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  with name "mycc2" on all peers And an admin installs the built chaincode package on "peer0.org1.example.com" And an admin installs the built chaincode package on "peer1.org1.example.com" # Note install does not take place on org2 peers Then a hash value is received on "peer0.org1.example.com" And a hash value is received on "peer1.org1.example.com" When the organization admins approve the upgraded chaincode package on all peers Then an error "<Error Message>" is received from "peer0.org2.example.com" And an error "<Error Message>" is received from "peer1.org2.example.com" {code}  ></description> </Issue>

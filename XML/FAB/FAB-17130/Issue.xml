CDATA Fabric does not allow same chaincode version re-instantiated on the given channel. One has to upgrade chaincode then instantiate. However, in case of private data chaincode .. example marbles_private , one may want to just update collection json on the same channel without upgrading chaincode. Currently this is not possible. Will be good to add capability to update collections.json on a given channel without need to upgrade chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

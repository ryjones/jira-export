CDATA When upgrading orderers and peers from v1.0.x to v1.1 using native deployment, which uses the v1.0 config files, needs to add new configuration variables from v1.1 config files as the environment variables in orderers and peers after upgrading. Need to know the differences between config files from v1.0 to v1.1 so that those differences can be set as environment variables in the upgraded orderers and peers respectively.     Orderer upgrade:  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/upgrade_to_one_point_one.html#update-orderer-binaries      Peer Upgrade:  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/upgrade_to_one_point_one.html#update-orderer-binaries      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We had similar issue tracked in github https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2346.  ~tuand27613  noticed same root cause. Please see his comments in ( https:// github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2346  ). As suggested by Tuan, possible fix is to upgrade docker version to 1.12 in Jenkins otherwise we have to increase the timeout after start peers and invoke transactions.   ~ryjones : Could you please upgrade docker version to 1.11 or 1.12 in Jenkins build machines?

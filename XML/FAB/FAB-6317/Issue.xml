CDATA Split the peer into the server and the client part. The peer binary will still be the server, while all client functions will be moved into the new fabriccli binary.  This change enables having different build strategies for the server and the client (for example dynamic vs static build, which is important for things like support for go plugins and PKCS11).  Also, this change is (hopefully) a step towards refactoring the fabric code so the fabric client protos and supporting libraries are decoupled from the server code. This way, the client API could be used by fabriccli and Go SDK (and potentially other Go based fabric client software) without having to depend on the whole fabric that includes the server code.  The separation will also reduce confusion due to `{{peer}}` doubling as CLI.  ></description> </Issue>

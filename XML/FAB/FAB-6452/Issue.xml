CDATA Refer to  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1  and the New Feature JIRA blocking this.  If a user wishes to use an external CA for generating and signing the certificates, it would be useful to leverage the fabric-ca-client and BCCSP to generate a certificate signing request for the keys generated by the BCCSP and write the CSR to a file without any interaction with the fabric-ca-server. This would allow the user to then send the CSR file to an external CA.  ></description> </Issue>

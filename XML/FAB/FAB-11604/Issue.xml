CDATA Problem: The 4 icons in upper left corner of the ReadTheDocs (GitHub, StackOverflow, RocketChat, YouTubeChannel) are messed up when you click on a link in the toc that points to a topic that resides inside a folder in the source tree.      ~rameshthoomu  - I think you fixed this problem earlier, but maybe we did not notice that the fix does not work when the documentation content does not reside at the root of the /source tree.         ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Deliver logic inÂ `orderer/common/deliver` does not correctly catch all possible errors, particularly for two cases:  1. While stream is shutdown gracefully, an error of type `io.EOF` is returned, which is ignorantly caught as `Error reading from stream`, and returned to caller of `Handle`. It should just be a Debug message and return `nil`.  2. Start and stop position in SeekInfo could be reversed (start > stop). This should be captured and properly logged.  ></description> </Issue>

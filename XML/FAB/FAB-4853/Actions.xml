CDATA It's a good idea to separate those samples from the main code from my opinion.  But please do clarify clearly what those abbreviations mean in some place, as it's not easy to guess from the sub-dir names. Or maybe can use explicit names like `first-network`, `first-chaincode` or `first-app`.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I totally agree with Baohua on the names and will go further: those short names are a no-go for me. There is little to gain from them and a lot to lose. Just expand to something like:  fabric-samples/first-network  fabric-samples/first-chaincode  fabric-samples/first-app  Otherwise, as we all know, having a separate repo has its downsides but overall I think this makes sense. We need to make it easy for users to get these without pulling the whole fabric repo.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, now that we have worked so hard to "lock" the APIs, I agree we should have a separate repo for the code samples.  We may indeed end up with different names and possibly versions/revisions... but first things first: +1  Thank you Chris.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA All of the JavaScript samples in the fabric-samples repository are under a "node" directory. This is problematic for two reasons:  1) JavaScript is the name of the programming language, and Node.js is the runtime for JavaScript chaincode. Developers will be looking for a sample that uses the programming language of their choice, so "javascript" is the more appropriate name for this sample.  2) Work has been done (and is still going on) to deliver first class support for TypeScript chaincode. TypeScript is a language that must be transpiled (compiled) down into JavaScript, and then it can be run on the same Node.js runtime as JavaScript chaincode. The directory name "node" is therefore vague, as it could apply to JavaScript or TypeScript chaincode.  This user story will rename all of the "node" sample directories to "javascript", to reflect the programming language that is used and also open the door for TypeScript samples to be delivered under a "typescript" directory in future user stories.  ></description> </Issue>

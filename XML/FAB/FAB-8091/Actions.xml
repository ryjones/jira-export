CDATA From a chaincode perspective, this error message is originating from the chaincode shim.  So, in order to fix the error message to discuss the underlying problem (an outdated shim) would require an update to the shim (thus solving the problem).  From a peer perspective, I also don't think the error message can be made more specific.  Essentially, the peer expects for the chaincode container to connect, but it is detecting that the container has not.  From the peer's perspective this could be because there is a bug in the chaincode which made it crash, or there could be a networking error between the chaincode and peer, a shim version mismatch, or probably some other scenarios which I am forgetting, so, I don't think that it's possible to make this error message more specific, as it would lead the user to a false cause when the shim connection problem has a different source.  I would propose that we change this to a doc defect and be sure to put these exact log strings in the upgrade docs so that users may easily search for them.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There is no detection that can happen at the peer level against a running chaincode container that cannot even connects to the peer. {quote}The chaincode container says it is a bad TLS certificate. And that is NOT the problem. {quote} That is exactly the problem, and the reason why they shim needs to be updated.  I can add some more text to the  Securing Communication With Transport Layer Security (TLS)|http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/enable_tls.html  document topic, which already mentions the {{remote error: tls: bad certificate}} message in its debugging section.     ></body> </Action>

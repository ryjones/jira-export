CDATA In some behave tests, we are dumping out  {{14:29:42 Proposal Response length: 1}}  {{14:29:42 Proposal Response payload '}}  and lots of data  before printing “All good”.   The output is a huge number of lines.  The print statements are from the sdk wrapper.   Those had been added for debug purposes, but were never removed.  We should stop printing the entire payload, with its non-text characters.  My suspicion is that these may be messing up the jenkins xml reader, so it is time to remove them, to eliminate this as a possible cause of FABCI-331.  ></description> </Issue>

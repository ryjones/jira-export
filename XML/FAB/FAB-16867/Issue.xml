CDATA Using the 'peer' binary as the cli has caused much confusion. (At least it's confused me...) In addition to being used to interact with the orderer, it relies on configuration data from {{core.yaml}} - something that is intended to be consumed by a server side component.  We want to decouple the server side configuration from the client configuration and, in support of that goal, we want to move {{peer}} subcommands to a new {{fabric}} cli.  The new cli should support {{chaincode}}, {{channel}}, {{version}}, and {{lifecycle}} subcommands. The {{node}} command should not be present.  For this first phase, the behavior and configuration of the {{fabric}} sub-commands should be exactly the same as they are for the {{peer}} command. We will use this overlap to aid with the transition from {{peer}} to {{fabric}} in tests and other consuming components.  ></description> </Issue>

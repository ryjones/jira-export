CDATA So it turns out that  ~asaningmaxchain  did put a changeset out there:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/12953/   I had missed that since this JIRA wasn't updated accordingly.  I know that  ~ajp  has a changeset out there good to go as well.  Let's review both and go with what's best.  My apologies to both of you for not catching this earlier.  ></body> </Action>

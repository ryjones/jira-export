CDATA cryptogen has the option to generate NodeOUs and currently uses "FabricPeer" and "FabricClient" for peers and clients respectively.  fabric-ca supports NodeOUs by specifying the "type" of user when registering but uses "peer" and "client".  The fact that they do not match causes issues when trying to bootstrap a network with cryptogen with NodeOUs enabled and then registering and enrolling users with fabric-ca.  The logical thing would be for cryptogen to simply use the same convention as fabric-ca.  ></description> </Issue>

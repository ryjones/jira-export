CDATA Create an integration test that ensures the default endorsement policy (a majority of the orgs in the channel must endorse chaincode proposals) is enforced when no policy is set in the chaincode definition.   This task will be complete when there is a test in e2e/lifecycle ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/integration/e2e/lifecycle/lifecycle_test.go) |https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/integration/e2e/lifecycle/lifecycle_test.go that specifies a chaincode with an empty string as the chaincode signature policy and channel config policy, deploys the chaincode using the integration helper function, and then verifies that chaincode invocations with only one org endorsement are rejected and invocations with a majority of org endorsements (2 out of 2 endorsements represents a majority in our standard two org networks in nwo) are successful.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As an end user I should be able to see all the default configurations for the corresponding components in one place. And it should be easy for me to find those files, including from doc page and BYFN instructions. And the set of yaml files should contain ALL the default values, and be put in a directory location named "config_defaults" or something like that.  It is not clear if the fabric/sampleconfig /*.yaml files are the default values, and they do not set default values for all the possible configuration variables. Apparently, someone needs to refer the source code to gain a complete understanding of all the default settings. * *peer/gossip/ledger/endorser* etc., related configurations needs to be captured in _*core.yaml*_ * *Orderer/Kafka* related default configurations in orderer.yaml (or what ever is the right file) * *configtx.yaml* _*-* channel config related configurations_     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Customers are expecting to see Migration instructions when migrating between releases. The Fabric docs use the term `upgrade` instead of `migrate`.  Add the term migrate to the 1.1 and 1.2 upgrade instructions so if they search for migrate or migrating, it takes them to our upgrade instructions.  Going forward in our upgrade docs (FAB-11756)Â  we should also use the term migrate.  ></description> </Issue>

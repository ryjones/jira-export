CDATA The EventHub class in hfc does not properly handle status and more importantly error events from the underlying GRPC library / connection.  For bidi GRPC streams, the Node grpc client emits "status" and "error" events.  Currently, hfc only handles the "data" and "end" events and only propagates the "data" event to the EventHub class.  I'd suggest only fixing this for the v1.0 release  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA when doing      GO_TAGS="pkcs11" make peer     the GO_TAGS value is not passed to the docker container where the peer is being built.     This started happening in 2.0 as the peer build is done inside a docker container while previous versions were built locally and build args were properly being propgagated.     We need a way to pass in the GO_TAGS env variable to the container where the peer is being built.  ></description> </Issue>

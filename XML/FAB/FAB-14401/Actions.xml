CDATA  ~firas.qutishat  What was reported and what you've changed are not the same {{make peer}} works as intended and creates a local image with the appropriate tags.  At the end of the day, the information reported does matter and I use bug triage as a forcing function to ensure the information is correct.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Also  {quote} What are you trying to do? What branch? {quote}  are still valid questions. I can infer all day that you're trying to build the docker image with tags but explicit responses are preferred over inference.  My final assumption, I assume  ~firas.qutishat  and  ~Baha-sk  are working together as the  ~Baha-sk  did not reopen or respond?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sykesm  this is for latest 2.0 version (master branch)     passing in PKCS11 tag as env variable prior to 'make peer' is not reflected in the build.  The env variable is empty.     This was not the case in previous Fabric versions, it started with 2.0     To resolve this,  ~firas.qutishat  pushed the patch mentioned in his last comment above.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So, part of the confusion here is simple: {{make peer}} does nothing with docker. The issue you're having is with {{make peer-docker}}.  Moving beyond that, the CR that was submitted is, imo, incomplete as it only carries the tags to the peer and does not address the orderer or other commands. I have made comments on the CR.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

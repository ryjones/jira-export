CDATA When installing Fabric Samples & Binaries using the curl command (found in  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html ), the couchdb, zookeeper, and kafka images w/ tag *x86_64-0.4.6* are downloaded.  However, in Docker Hub, the most recent version of those images have the tag *x86_64-0.4.7*.  Will there be a change coming?  Please advise.  Advance apologies if this is already a known issue.  I tried searching on JIRA but couldn't find anything.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently the signatures of various messages in gossip are inside the inner type, i.e:  {code:borderStyle=solid} message AliveMessage { Member membership  = 1; PeerTime timestamp = 2; bytes signature    = 3; bytes identity     = 4; } {code}  It's better to move the messages to the above level of the GossipMessage that encapsulates all messages, so it'll be: {code:borderStyle=solid} message GossipMessage {  // used mainly for testing, but will might be used in the future // for ensuring message delivery by acking uint64 nonce  = 1;  // The channel of the message. // Some GossipMessages may set this to nil, because // they are cross-channels but some may not bytes channel = 2;   enum Tag { UNDEFINED    = 0; EMPTY        = 1; ORG_ONLY     = 2; CHAN_ONLY    = 3; CHAN_AND_ORG = 4; } Tag tag = 3; oneof content { // This is where the inner message resides . . . } bytes signature = n } {code}    ></description> </Issue>

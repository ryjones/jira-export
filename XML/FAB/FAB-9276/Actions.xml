CDATA  ~ericmvaughn   - I've looked a bit more into this and I don't think that there is anything we can do within Fabric to help here, especially since we'll eventually have additional options for state databases.  It also does not look like there is *yet* a standard for canonicalization when it comes to JSON in terms of hashing / digital signatures.  So it seems like you will need to decided what canonical form you want to use in your application and then take the hash of that form and that ensure that you convert whatever you get back from the state db into that form prior to checking the hash   ~denyeart  - any thoughts here?   I'm inclined to make this as "WON'T FIX" as we can't really fix this  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In the CI, and more infrequntly in local machines, tests fail due to timing issues where the time provided by the test-writer was not enough for that particular instance.  It makes sense to deploy a polling mechanism with scaled weight where the desired value/state will be polled several times (up to a set upper limit time) before declaring it as a fail.  Some potential use case are: checking for deployment of chaincode, checking for gossip-leader/non-leader from the log, etc.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA On one of our setup, orderer fails to connect with `Connecting to the Kafka cluster` and looking at its log, it is for `setupChannelConsumerForChannel`. We see only 1 channel able to successfully complete `setupChannelConsumerForChannel` however rest channels (including system channel) is having this issue.  The other connect points `setupParentConsumerForChannel` and `setupProducerForChannel` has received the connect message response - assuming they are good.  This is a new setup and initially for ~3days, everything was good. There was 1 orderer (out of 3) which got restarted, and above problem was seen. The other 2 orderers were running w/o any problem. We restarted the other 2 orderer (docker service), and this problem started for remaining too.  I have uploaded the required logs of orderer, kafka, zookeeper on secureFTP site ( http://dts.cls-group.com/)|http://dts.cls-group.com/  who's credential are available  ~Clayton Sims  and  ~altharp   filename: FAB-7352-OrdererChannelPartitionError-6Dec2017.zip   ~sanchezl   ~kchristidis   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There appears to be no way to control the amount of work that a peer has to handle. This presents a problem when the peer is running on a machine with a fixed amount of memory.  Some examples: * No limit on number of simultaneous event service connections. * No limit on number of simultaneous proposal endorsement requests. * No limit on size of proposals.  Abusing any of the above limits can result in out of memory related panics on machines without infinite memory.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the AttributeRequest struct has "Require" attribute and is set to false if the user does not specify the attribute. But the fabric-ca-client command line makes the attributes required if the attributes are not qualified with ":opt".  To make the API and command line client consistent, the "Require" attribute of AttributeRequest struct will be changed to "Optional", whose value is false by default. This makes the attributes required by default.  This change requires changes to SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

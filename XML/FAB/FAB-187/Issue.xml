CDATA Validation policy is implemented by validator system chaincode (VSCC), which is associated with 1 or more chaincodes and called by Peer before committing transactions. VSCC works with ESCC (endorser system chaincode) to ensure a transaction is valid.   We want to implement following default policies: # At least 1 valid signature from those participating on the chain # Explicit list of signatures; advanced implementation may allow boolean expressions including AND, OR. For example, (a AND b) OR c # Percent of valid signatures (eg 80%) of those participating on the chain. This could be complex in counting the total of the endorsers at the time of validation which could lead to none determinism since each peer might have a different total due to gossip network.  Note that we want the policy to be consistent per chaincode deployment. If a chaincode is bound to a percentage policy, then it will always be using that same policy. To change the validation policy, the chaincode would have to be redeployed. Therefore, when a chaincode is deployed, it needs to specify ESCC/VSCC and the validation policy to enforce during the life-cycle of the chaincode.  We also need a function `CheckEndorsementPolicy(Transaction)` to allow app to optionally check endorsement policy correctness prior to submitting the transaction to the network. This same function is called during validation.  ></description> </Issue>

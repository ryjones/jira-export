CDATA Unfortunately, there is a tight coupling between the peer version and the ccenv version. And now that we publish a latest tag (which is 1.4) we cannot afford to have the master/2.0.0 peer use the 1.4 ccenv.  Therefore having the default value be the actual version in core.yaml is correct.  If you want to use latest, then you can override `CORE_CHAINCODE_BUILDER`.  We currently do have `latest` for javaenv and nodeenv, but the reality is that we should also use the exact version for those as well.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Isn't BAD_REQUEST the error that the end userÂ sees?  What would be a more appropriate response code?  This works as it should as far as I can tell, but perhaps I'm missing something.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kchristidis  This is not a BAD_REQUEST error, was requesting to log a more detailed message as to why "returned x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid) for identity" certificate is not valid,   When I read the message now it is informative, but thought actual reason like of non-validity like- "Container (orderer) time lags from the time on client" - could be more helpful, not sure if that is reasonable to ask.  Since transaction goes through after some wait time - may be by fixing start time in crypto-gen to one day earlier could also fix the issue.    ></body> </Action>

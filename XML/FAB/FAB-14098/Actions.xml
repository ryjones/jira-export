CDATA Can you provide some more context? Where are you seeing the messages? Is it in a peer log or somewhere else?Â   Also, can you look in either the peer logs or the orderer logs for messages similar to the following: {code:java}  channel: <channel-name>  Client authorization revoked for deliver request from <address>: <error>{code} That should tell you exact reason for the FORBIDDEN status to be returned. The possibilities are that the identity has expired or the policy for blocks is not satisfied.  Â   Â   Â   ></body> </Action>

Then with edited I meant edited out of the channel let&apos;s say removed from the channel. I think this error comes from my client which is still connecting to the channel. I just wanted to have some more detailed error message which seems the case if I had looked in the orderer logs earlier. I will try to wait until this happens again and then retry, from your comments the error looks sufficient for me." created="2019-02-11 11:55:20.0" updateauthor="chwolf" updated="2019-02-11 11:55:20.0"/>

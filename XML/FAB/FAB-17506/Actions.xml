CDATA I learnt that Hyperledger Fabric does not provide custom OU support in profile section. But the documentation at  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/msp.html#best-practices  suggests in point number 2.1 that we can define policies which capture the custom OUs of the identity.  _Configuration of that MSP would consist of a list of root CAs, intermediate CAs and admin certificates; and membership identities would include the organizational unit ({{OU}}) a member belongs to. Policies can then be defined to capture members of a specific {{OU}}, and these policies may constitute the read/write policies of a channel or endorsement policies of a chaincode._  I request you to please make the required changes in the documentation.  ></body> </Action>

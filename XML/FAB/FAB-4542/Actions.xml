CDATA So, the current level of test coverage for fabric is:  *Packages*   99% *Files*   97% *Classes*   93% *Methods*   91%*Lines*   84% *Conditionals*   100%   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-x86_64/   fabric-ca  *Packages*   100% *Files*   100% *Classes*   100% *Methods*   93%*Lines*   82% *Conditionals*   100%   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-ca/job/fabric-ca-merge-x86_64/   fabric-sdk-node  *Packages*   100% *Files*   100% *Classes*   100% *Methods*   83%*Lines*   86% *Conditionals*   77%   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-sdk-node/job/fabric-sdk-node-merge-x86_64/   fabric-sdk-java   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-sdk-java/job/fabric-sdk-java-verify-x86_64/   So, the question for we maintainers is, is this sufficient for UT? I tend to think it is for where we are. Can it be improved? Sure, but I think that we can and should as we move forward past 1.0.  Then, there is the BDD testing that handles much of our integration testing for CI, and the ever growing set of BDD tests that we are adding for our daily tests, and the performance and scale tests we are adding for our weekly tests along with the results from the manual SVT testing that the IBM team has been doing in their lab which is described  here|https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/quality_assurance ,   Can we close this aspect of the exit criteria? Please vote.  ></body> </Action>

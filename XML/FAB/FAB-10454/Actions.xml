CDATA That's because ARMv7 is 32bits architecture, however, fabric supports 64bits architecture only( even if you can successfully build fabric v1.0 on armv7, this is not a good way, as fabric code doesn't pay attention to thread safety on 32bits architecture).  So the best way is to install a 64bits OS on RPi3, there is a link you can download pi64 OS,   https://github.com/bamarni/pi64 , install pi64 lite version please, there are some errors on desktop version. Installing git, golang(64bits), docker, then you can build the fabric again on 64pi OS. Notice: 1.fabric official Makefile doesn't support aarch64 architecture, so you need to add *DOCKER_BASE_aarch64=aarch64/ubuntu:xenial* in Makefile. 2. During building base images, actually, there is no  node-v8.9.4-linux-aarch64.tar.gz|https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.9.4/node-v8.9.4-linux-arm64.tar.gz  in  https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.9.4/ , so change it into  node-v8.9.4-linux-arm64.tar.gz|https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.9.4/node-v8.9.4-linux-arm64.tar.gz   at line 73 of fabric-baseimage/scrpts/common/setup.sh  ></body> </Action>

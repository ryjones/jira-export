CDATA Presently, the core/chaincode package does a chaincode invocation of the LSCC in order to get back the chaincode definition information necessary to properly route chaincode requests and start chaincode containers.  This is a tight coupling between the external LSCC API and the internal chaincode package implementation which is a problem to begin with, but additionally, there are unnecessary rounds of marshaling and unmarshaling, and added complexities in mocking and wiring.  Instead, lifecycle should be presented to the chaincode package as an invokable interface which is not chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

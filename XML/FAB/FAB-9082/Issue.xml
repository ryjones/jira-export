Edit this section in italic and change to a note:  _Change:_  _\{The MSP is a peer component that allows them to verify transaction requests arriving from clients and to sign transaction results(endorsements). The Writing policy is defined at channel creation time, and determines which user is entitled to submit a transaction to that channel.}_  _to (a real note block)_  Note: The MSP is a peer component that allows a peer to verify transaction requests arriving from clients and to sign transaction results (endorsements). The writing policy is defined at channel creation time, and determines which users are entitled to submit a transaction to that channel.     2. Remove this line at the bottom or properly reformat this into a real note block and link it to the swimlane diagram it refers to. Not sure where that is.  *Note*: See the swimlane diagram to better understand the server side flow and the protobuffers.     ></description> </Issue>

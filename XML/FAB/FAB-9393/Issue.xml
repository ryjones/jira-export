CDATA Go vet can take advantage of the build cache as of Go 1.10. See  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-dev/qfa3mHN4ZPA/X2UzjNV1BAAJ      The golinter.sh script should set $GOCACHE to .build/go-cache director, similar to the unit test script which was updated in FAB-9320.     By default, my Linux system will try to use the cache directory /.cache which fails as the non-root user does not have permission. The logging is less clear as to what is happening on my macOS system, but setting the $GOCACHE to the .build directory results in a 20 to 30 second speedup when running `make linter` so it also appears the cache is not being utilized when using the default cache directory.     Ideally, we'd should consider setting $GOCACHE in the make file, but I ran into issues trying to do that. I can see on my Linux system that the `go build` commands are also failing to take advantage of the default cache directory.  ></description> </Issue>

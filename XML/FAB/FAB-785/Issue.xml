CDATA Modify our node.js SDK tests, to eliminate copy of entire Fabric, and instead the tests should dynamically retrieve. (The required actual modifications will depend on the solution offered by FAB-11, upon which this issue is blocked). We can significantly reduce the space required in every copy of the tests saved in the release-criteria repository, or in Fabric itself, and reduce the time to deploy as well.   ></description> </Issue>

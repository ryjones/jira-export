CDATA The fabric-test-verify-x86_64 is failing as smoke-test tasks are carried out in a different order/sequence. The tasks must be aligned accordingly(in the Makefile) so that there is no error when the smoke-test tasks are performed.  *Build log*  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/552/console  ></description> </Issue>

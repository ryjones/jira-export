CDATA Currently we can only have a single fabric version level (capability version) in all integration tests via controlling the configtx_template.go.  Ideally we will have an ability to spin a test instance, and toggle the capability level we want, and have the original configtx_template in some least common level, such as 1.4.1 or so.    ~sykesm    ></description> </Issue>

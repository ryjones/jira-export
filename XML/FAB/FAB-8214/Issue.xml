CDATA Endorsement Policy test document  ^Endorsement_policy_verification_testcases_v1.1.0-preview.pdf   Test cases include the simulation of insufficient proposal responses (simulated with the help of passing target peers or stopping endorser containers) and RW sets mismatch in those proposals (simulated with the help of peer file system tampering and non-deterministic chaincode)  Tests were performed on fabric, fabric-ca and fabric-samples/balance-transfer v1.1.0-preview version, with the attached patch  ^endorse_test_code_changes_v1.1.0-preview.txt   Â   Patch intention: is to pass peer names from the client side and to prove that if RW Sets differs from endorsers (and if there is no check at client side for RWset equality), state changes are applied based on the last endorser's RWset.  This patch is useful, especially for Objective 2: Policy where endorsement from one of the two organizations is sufficient.  ></description> </Issue>

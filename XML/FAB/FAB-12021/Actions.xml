CDATA  ~wlahti  These are my logs.  ^ChannelEventHub client log.txt   : This log from fabric-sdk-node:1.2.0 / ChannelEventHub.js  My test client used this eventHub to registerTxEvent, and sendTransaction. The transaction was success, but no txEvent or block data returned.   ^fabric docker log.txt   : This log from fabric-peer:1.2.0 docker container  After 306 line, 'deliver' received seekInfo but no response log after I think something wrong in fabric-release-1.2/common/deliver.go line 227 ~ 281  I removed peer address & private keys in those logs  If you want any other logs, please tell me.    ></body> </Action>

Note that the fix was merged into the codebase for 1.1.1, 1.2.1, and 1.3.0 so the published images for each major version will soon all have this fix. Marking this as a duplicate of FAB-11094.

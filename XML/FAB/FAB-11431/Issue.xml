CDATA Enhance the read write set (RWSet) to include operations so that it becomes the read write operation set (RWOSet). At endorse time, the sequence of operations will need to be captured so that they can be executed at commit time.  Â   There are a few open questions. # Can a single transaction include both a read/write set and an operation set? If so ## what is the order of execution? ## what are the semantics of read your own writes?  ></description> </Issue>

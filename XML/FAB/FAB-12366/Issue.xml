CDATA Enable the chaincode to reason about identities based on a channel's MSP. Those identities should not be limited e.g. to the transaction creator or to the type of identity (x509), but support the full range of identities also supported by a channel's MSP.  This allows a chaincode developer to check whether a given identity belongs to an organization participating in the channel and extract attributes about this identity.  ></description> </Issue>

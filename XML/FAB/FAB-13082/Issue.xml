CDATA # Function such as RetrieveCollection() and RetrieveCollectionConfigPackage() areÂ never used except in mocks and test files. # In gossip, at least in 7 different places, the following 3 operations are repeated which can be avoided by introducing a API called IsAMemberOf(). ** retrieves collection access policy by calling RetrieveCollectionAccessPolicy() ** get the access filter func from the collection access policy ** create the evaluation policy and check for membership # we would need a cache in collection store to avoid repeated crypto operation. This would be simple to implement when we introduce IsAMemberOf() APIs.  ></description> </Issue>

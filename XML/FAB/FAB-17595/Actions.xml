The ability to instantiate different chaincodes on different peers isn&apos;t meant to allow you to provide different state altering logic (which is what you&apos;ve done here). You&apos;ve instantiated on an &quot;OR&quot; policy with only two members, so of course you can arrive a different result based on which peer the transaction is sent to. It&apos;s still up to the chaincode developers and network admin to write deterministic chaincode across peers and use a common sense endorsement policy" created="2020-03-09 17:06:54.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2020-03-09 17:06:54.0"/>

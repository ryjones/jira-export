CDATA Now that the fabric-test repository is established, we should remove everything in the test directory under hyperledger/fabric/test. The tools and tests are no longer supported there and will likely fail.  First ensure there are no CI jobs that use or refer to any of the tools or tests under this location. Then remove the entire directory structure from master development branch. And possibly from future release branches, too.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The peers should switch to another orderer when the orderer is stopped. That does not seem to be happening in our environment.  Abstract: I am performing testing to ensure that I am still able to perform channel create, channel join, install / instantiate chaincode, invokes, and queries when one of our 3 orderers is stopped.  Details: I am successfully executing invokes on my two peers: fabric-peer-org1-15999a and fabric-peer-org1-15999c. I am then stopping fabric-orderer-18193b (I have two other orderers: fabric-orderer-18193a and fabric-orderer-18193c). Once fabric-orderer-18193b is stopped I cannot successfully complete any invokes to either peer.  SDK.txt lists is the sdk output during this problem.  You should be able to reproduce this by having 2 orderers and a peer that is being sent continuous transactions via the SDK, if you stop the orderer the peer is using, transactions will stop and the peer will not fail over to the other orderer.  I've attached logs but noticed he peer logs didn't successfully upload. Â I've asked the person who found this to reattach the peer logs.  ></description> </Issue>

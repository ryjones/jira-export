CDATA  ~jyellick   ~latitiah   ~nagap   Why do we have a separate capability flag for ACL plus a capability flag for v1.2? And is this explained in the docs?  Dod the upgrade docs explain summary of all the new features/capabilities that are provided when v1.2 capability is set?  How about the list of changes/additions for all the config variables? Or are we pointing folks to the fabric/sampleconfig/*.yaml files and telling them to compare the 1.1 to 1.2 versions?  ></body> </Action>

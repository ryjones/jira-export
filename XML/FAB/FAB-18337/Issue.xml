CDATA  # Creating the system channel with config block with number >0, when there are already channels referenced (created) by it, such that on boarding is needed for both the system channel and additional channels.    * Define a 2 node raft network. Generate the genesis block of the system channel. * Start 3 empty OSNs. * Join 2 OSNs with a genesis block.  * Check that the servers have a state that signals restart is needed (List API), and that they do not accept TXs on system channel, nor API Join commands * Restart said servers * create channel A * create channel B * configure the system channel to include OSN3 (to make last config block height > 1) * configure channel B to include OSN3  * get last config block of system channel and join the 3rd OSN with it.  * verify onboarding on all channels - A config-tracker, B consenter * correct behavior by transacting on all channels.  ></description> </Issue>

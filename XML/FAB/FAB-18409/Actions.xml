CDATA  ~ankitm123  Yes, it would be great if you could help with this issue.  However, your latest comment is not correct... there is no concept of chaincode 'name' at the packaging step. The 'name' will become the namespace in the state db when the chaincode is deployed (committed) to a channel. This is totally different from the label that is used while packaging. A label in a packaged chaincode will often denote the version of the chaincode code and will therefore often have dots in it, e.g. "1.0.0". The 'name' will live across versions of the packaged chaincode and dots are not allowed.  Additionally, the same chaincode package can be deployed (committed) multiple times to different names/namespaces, therefore it does not make sense to define a name during the packaging step.  ></body> </Action>

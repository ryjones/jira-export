One thing we can do (at least temporarily) is stop collecting all those logs and directing to stdout/stderr. e.g. try commenting out this code  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/release-1.4/feature/environment.py#L61-L70  which should avoid the problem and the tests can run to completion." created="2019-11-04 17:31:46.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-11-04 17:31:46.0"/>

Yes, using the current fabric-peer (instead of an old version of fabric-ca-peer that was still in nexus) certainly makes a difference!" created="2019-11-07 15:50:24.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-11-07 15:50:24.0"/>

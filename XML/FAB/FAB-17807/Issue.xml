CDATA `peer node rollback` command currently preserves private data store, since the assumption is that private data is still valid and should be used as the peer re-processes blocks to catch up to latest height.  However, in the case of a network level backup/restore due to a disaster, the consortium may decide to restore to a prior orderer height. In these scenarios the peers would need to be rolled back to the same height, including the private data store.  ></description> </Issue>

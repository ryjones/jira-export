CDATA In the Production Simulation Lab network, run a test scenario forever to exercise marbles_private chaincode using the SideDB. Run in its own channel (e.g. channelThree), requiring a peer in 2 orgs to do the endorsements. Set debug logs to ERROR, and monitor them for errors.  Use peers in Org0 (which is a member of every channel) and a unique org that is the only other org in this channel - a channel which is used for nothing else. We potentailly could use this channel in future for other traffic tests which use SideDB (using same or different peers within same two orgs).  Use a low traffic rate (max 1 Tx per minute) so this will run a long time before the lab runs out of disk space.  Using the same channel and chaincode and testcase, one runCases thread should specify the endorser peers, and another can run simultaneously run using Service Discovery.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In lockbasedtxmgr, we have a lockBasedQueryExecutor and a lockBasedTxSimulator struct. The lockBasedTxSimulator implements mainly SetXXX() APIs while lockBasedQueryExecutor implements GetXXX() APIs. As the transaction simulation also involves query, the lockBasedTxSimulator encapsulate lockBasedQueryExecutor. Only in the lockBasedTxSimulator, we collect readSet while using GetXXX() and writeSet while using SetXXX(). However, when we use lockBasedQueryExecutor alone, we don't collect readSet.  Currently, we have an unnecessary indirection with QueryHelper and it makes code readability a bit hard. Hence, we need to merge the QueryHelper with the lockBasedQueryExecutor itself.   ></description> </Issue>

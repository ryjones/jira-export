CDATA Let's work on this for 2.0 timeframe.Â   PTE currently enrolls admin user and uses it for all config updates - as well as transaction proposals which normally would be done by a client user. Since our automation suites set our own policies, we can get away with continuing to use admin user for everything. But this should be fixed, to use correct type of user. This would allow others to use PTE for testing their own networks and policies.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA PTE should create/enroll admins for peer orgs and orderer orgs with CA(s) listed in the connprofile, and use those admins to join peers or submit config updates, etc.  This builds upon but is lower priority than fab-15393 for invokes/queries, since we could continue with current operation for now, and expect customers to have created their network peers, channels, instantiated chaincodes, etc. And this is more complicated because we may want to use separate admins for each org.  ></description> </Issue>

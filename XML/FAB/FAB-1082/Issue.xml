CDATA This is from a discussion with  ~muralisr . We just want to document it here. Depending on further discussion, this issue might get moved to another spot in JIRA  We need a syntax to describe a policy such that we can describe what the policy does as listed in FAB-187.  Use of this syntax include describing the VSCC policy attached to a chaincode deploy and describing the ingress/egress policies created for the bootstrap genesis block.  ></description> </Issue>

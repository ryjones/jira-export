CDATA We are not deprecating the behave framework in fabric-test repo any time soon.  The gossip.feature file has tests similar to this; we could add a test there to bring up a network with every peer being a leader, to see if it is currently working. If broken, then we should triage to be sure it is not a fabric bug - and if not then we can reconsider if it really is due to missing or broken functionality in the test framework.  ></body> </Action>

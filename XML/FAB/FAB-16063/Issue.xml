CDATA Depends on framework: what test tool framework to use to show results? Plan: use go test (ginkgo) to run the tests.  Once the framework is implemented, input the result files (mostly .xml files) into the Azure pipeline.  Â   Note (Dec 3): this will be completed when we move the k8s systest jobs to azp. Other tasks exist (FAB-16160) to reimplement the test drivers from python to go, and execute with ginkgo, and produce the xml output results. The CI Jobs will be defined to run in Azure environment (FAB-16760); the results will be displayed along with all the jobs results.  The final step, if desired, would be to create a single "Test Overview Status" display page with all the test suites results: e.g., daily systest runs in multiple networks in k8s cluster, longrunning test, for both master and 1.4 release branches, etc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Alternatively, we could COUNT the drops, and provide an interface to query this along with any other types of failure counters that could be helpful to analyze problems with each peer's behavior.  This might be better in terms of using limited resources. If we are dropping msgs due to overflow, generating more debug logs might not be the best use of overwhelmed CPU.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Due to the following reasons, as explained by Yacov, we are ok to accept log as debug level: * since dropped msgs can be an expected behavior in an overloaded peer * since the target peer that does not receive the msg could get it from another source * since there are other FAB issues open already to create counters / metrics, which would include pegs for dropped msgs such as this  Also, I am creating another FAB to followup, to remove the incorrect English word "overflown".  ></body> </Action>

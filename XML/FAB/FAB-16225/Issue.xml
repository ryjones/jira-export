CDATA Reconciliation should be intelligent enough to not retry pulling private data forever, based on some new configuration settings.  This may be important in the following scenarios: * private data is not available on any collection member, either because it was missing from the start, the peers that had the private data have gone away from the network, or peers had archived old blocks or have been more recently bootstrapped from a later snapshot. * In some network level backup/restore scenarios, it may be acceptable to restore peers to a lower height than ordering service, implying that the private data between the heights is now missing.  ></description> </Issue>

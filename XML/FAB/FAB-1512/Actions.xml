<Action id="42833" issue="13921" author="muralisr" type="comment" body=" ~sykesm  I had submitted a CR for this  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3623/  but marked it  -1 pending docs and tests. The plan was to make this more usable and maybe even move it to fabric-samples. One option is to create a separate CR for this and accept the CR and  mark it done. Another is to leave it as is. Either way my plan is to work on this some more." created="2018-04-11 17:25:39.0" updateauthor="muralisr" updated="2018-04-11 17:25:39.0"/>

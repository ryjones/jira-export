CDATA Found some problems with the CCChecker while working on a second, "doublespend',  sample. This was mainly due to creating an instance of CC object as the Concurrency Property for the chaincode. Cleaning that up helped generalize the framework * The name of the chaincode is unique (in keeping with unique deployment name) * shadow is in charge of the query iteration (than artificial loop controlled by the framework) * Invoke and Validate boundaries are clean * reporting is straightforward  With this foundation both "newkeyperinvoke" and "doublespender" examples use the framework naturally.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It would be best if softhsm.so could be made to work on build machines. This would let us test  p11 bccsp in COP/FABRIC/SDK as part of the build.  This might not be feasible (i.e. softhsm bugs, lack of ecc support) but worth a try.  If that is not possible, use this item to agree that p11 bccsp code will be tested out-of-band on machines with a crypto-card    ></description> </Issue>

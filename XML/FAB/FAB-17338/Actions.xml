CDATA I took a look at the command AZP uses to checkout the pull request and it appears to go after the merge commit. As long as that works, it should be testing all of the changes from the base branch.  {code} git -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: basic ***" fetch --force --tags --prune --progress --no-recurse-submodules origin +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* +refs/pull/912/merge:refs/remotes/pull/912/merge remote: Enumerating objects: 17, done. {code}  That said, drone-CI had a number of issues using that ref on GitHub and would occasionally get the wrong commit  1 . GitHub said that they don't document the merge ref and that it's not supported. No idea if that's still true or if that story would hold now that AZP and GitHub are the same company.   1 : https://discourse.drone.io/t/github-claims-that-merge-refs-are-undocumented-feature/1100  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Obviously I can't confirm it at the moment, but I bet this is actually occurring. A couple months ago  ~caod  pointed out that AZP checked out the wrong commit when it did its tests (which were successful), but the actual code had a bug in it and he had to submit a second PR to fix it. We were never able to replicate it so we wrote it off as a flake.  A few times the doc team has noted that their PR's, which only contain doc related changes, have triggered tests.  And on several occasions we've seen builds that have no business triggering Gossip, actually trigger Gossip unit tests (on time a single change to the README triggered them).  This would explain a lot of the strange behavior we thought we were seeing.  ></body> </Action>

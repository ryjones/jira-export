CDATA This is a critical bug that affect both v1.4.x and v2.x (enabled raft consensus by default).  When a OSN was removed and rejoined the channel later, the channel will fail to elect a leader and cannot recover.Â   This is because the OSN cannot get a correct raft id after re-joining.  The solution should be letting the OSN re-calculate its raft id.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="25160" issue="15874" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="Jim explained to me that this is a grpc client sample, which is currently broken due to lack of signing.  We really don&apos;t have many other grpc client samples like this.  For the most part, we will point people to use sdk (which does work), or have them look at the sdk impl if they want to understand the detailed grpc interactions.  This sample is outdated and not very useful anymore, therefore I suggest we delete it before 1.0, rather than try to fix it." created="2017-06-02 18:13:36.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2017-06-02 18:13:36.0"/>

CDATA It was easy enough fix, so fixed it -  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10123.   ~nickgaski  could use help with doc. We can resurrect old doc (which was actually pretty good) and fix it up for 1.0  ></body> </Action>

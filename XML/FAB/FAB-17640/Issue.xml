CDATA We want to remove the config package from Fabric before the release-2.1 branch is cut so it doesn't go into v2.1.0. This may involve a formal RFC justifying the creation (can probably just refer to information in FAB-17628) so the linux foundation can approve and create a new repo for us.  Â   *Acceptance*  A new repo created in the hyperledger org that contains renamed packages for the config code. Contributing guide, CI process/configuration, integration tests exist for the new repo.  ></description> </Issue>

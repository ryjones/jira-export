CDATA In many of the test files that are imported from the fabric repository in the hyperledger/fabric/test path, there are references to "github.com/hyperledger/fabric" but as we are using fabric as a submodule in the fabric-test repository, we need to update the test tools and scripts accordingly.   There are multiple README files in the different directories under this repo, but no overall README.   ></description> </Issue>

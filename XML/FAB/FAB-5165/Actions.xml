CDATA I am changing this to a bug since under a sudden intensive burst of blocks - the blocks are not going to reach the peers via gossip but only at a much later time, with state transfer and if the leader peer is not available it would mean the block is lost until the leader is resurrected.     Hence I think it can be seen as a bug.  ></body> </Action>

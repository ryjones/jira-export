CDATA The runtimes of the tests are below:    {code:java} --- PASS: TestOrderingServiceConnFailure (0.00s) --- PASS: TestOrderingServiceStreamFailure (0.00s) --- PASS: TestOrderingServiceSetupFailure (0.00s) --- PASS: TestOrderingServiceFirstOperationFailure (0.00s) --- PASS: TestOrderingServiceCrashAndRecover (0.00s) --- PASS: TestOrderingServicePermanentCrash (0.00s) --- PASS: TestLimitedConnAttempts (0.00s) --- PASS: TestLimitedTotalConnTimeRcv (5.51s) --- PASS: TestLimitedTotalConnTimeSnd (5.50s) --- PASS: TestGreenPath (0.00s) --- PASS: TestCloseWhileRecv (2.01s) --- PASS: TestCloseWhileSleep (2.02s) --- PASS: TestProductionUsage (0.50s) --- PASS: TestDisconnect (1.60s) --- PASS: TestDisconnectAndDisableEndpoint (0.54s) --- PASS: TestNewDeliverService (2.01s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceRestart (5.17s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceFailover (12.51s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceUpdateEndpoints (2.50s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceServiceUnavailable (2.60s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceAbruptStop (0.50s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceShutdown (4.50s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceShutdownRespawn (7.50s) --- PASS: TestDeliverServiceBadConfig (0.00s) --- PASS: TestRetryPolicyOverflow (0.00s) --- PASS: TestTLSBinding (3.51s) {code}  I'm sure we can shave time from *TestDeliverServiceFailover (12.51s)* if we really want to...  most of the tests either run a negligible amount of time, or they just test corner cases that are impossible / very hard to test with a ginkgo-style integration test.   ></body> </Action>

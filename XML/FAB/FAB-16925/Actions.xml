Eventually Should Not Contain raises red flags. It could happen immediately and then an error is written. 2. Polling on a 5 second interval seems suspect. 3. Why isn't Consistently the correct approach. 4. Does the assertion need to be in the middle of the test or can it be done after the runners exit?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/34225 Cleanup some idioms in the raft config tests  Ended up removing the assertions. It looks like the code would eat the logs until they were gone and then asserted there were no errors (in the now empty) logs.  Also fixed up some grouper references that were unnecessary.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a companion task to FAB-13523, the new lifecycle should implement the interface which returns the validation parameters for a chaincode.  Note, as a special edge case, this validation interface should also return the validation info for '+lifecycle' itself, beginning with an automatically generated signature policy requiring the majority of orgs to endorse.  Later, we should support evaluating channel config policies as endorsement policies, and this validation info can be changed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/pull/46  (master branch) addresses many of the items in the description, but not the following. These remaining items can be done with another PR. They would increase coverage in the key areas: * Add a samplejava testcase to the k8s systest suite for raft network, which should run all 3 samplecc in go, nodejs, java. * Add the SBE test to the k8s raft-couchdb-mutualtls network-spec test suite.  * Require 2 endorsements for more tests, instead of just 1, and send the invoke transactions to peers in multiple orgs. Only the SBE testcase does this today.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are number of places where {{bccsp/factory#GetDefault()}} is used to get a BCCSP implementation. Each call site should be evaluate in context.  Where an actual implementation is needed, instead of asking for the implementation, the required instance should be explicitly provided and wired to the consumer.  Where the implementation is being used for software crypto operations in test, consider replacing it with basic go crypto.  As of current master, the following packages seem to be impacted:  {code} token/tms/plain/verifier.go token/client/grpc.go core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/rwsetutil/query_results_helper_test.go core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/rwsetutil/query_results_helper.go core/chaincode/accesscontrol/mapper_test.go core/chaincode/shim/ext/entities/testutils.go core/chaincode/shim/ext/entities/entities_test.go core/common/ccprovider/cdspackage.go core/common/ccprovider/sigcdspackage.go internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go internal/peer/gossip/mcs_test.go internal/peer/common/common.go common/util/utils.go msp/mspimpl.go msp/configbuilder.go {code}  Acceptance: {{bccsp.GetDefault}} and its associated package level state is gone or an unprioritized story has been created that details the complexity involved in removing the reference.  ></description> </Issue>

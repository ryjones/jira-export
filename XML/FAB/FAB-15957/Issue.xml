CDATA The ledger currently maintains a small number of protobuf files outside of the protos tree. The goal was to prevent these from being consumed as fabric "api" but, in reality, they're used in the blockchain marshaling and, as such, are part of the surface area of the project.  In order to enable tools outside of the core fabric tree to decode and use these datatypes, the protos should be promoted into the protos tree, the bindings should be generated from there, and the ledger component updated to pull in the new imports as appropriate.  Acceptance: protos are in a sub-directory of the {{protos}} tree and the generated go bindings live in a package rooted under {{protos}}.  ></description> </Issue>

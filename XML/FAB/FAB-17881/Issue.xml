CDATA Due to the limitation of Fabric not being able to use the Fabric-CA in its integration tests, the difficulty with writing an HSM integration test is high, requiring the developer to interface with the HSM directly.  To allow us to test HSM functionality, and test changes to the Fabric codebase, we should write a functional test that can consume Fabric images and stand up a network with the HSM enabled.  This test will use 1 Peer, 1 orderer, and 1 CA.  ></description> </Issue>

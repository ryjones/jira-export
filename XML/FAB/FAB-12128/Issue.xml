CDATA Hi,  When trying to use Hyperledger Explorer with  Balance-Transfer sample| https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.2/balance-transfer  , an error related to the impossibility to access the network is raised:  Class syncPlatform.js  Line 123: {code:java} // code placeholder throw new ExplorerError(explorer_mess.error.ERROR_1009); {code} By checking the code, I noticed that the reason is that the variable peer.status is NULL, which is retrieved by method getPeerStatus from class FabricClient.js, that basically looks for 'adminPeers' - the method name is kind of confusing...    The data comes from 'discover' variable, that never finds any peer associated to the giving organizations (line 376 from method initializeChannelFromDiscover.js): {code:java} // code placeholder let org = discover_results.peers_by_org org_name ; for (var peer of org.peers) { // no peer is found, so no ADMIN peer status is retrieved att all {code}  Are you looking into this issue already?     Regards,  BravoBardo        ></description> </Issue>

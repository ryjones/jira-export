CDATA As a consumer of the fabric API, I would like to reference orderer related types in a separate namespace from configtx. Currently a consumer would pass a configtx.Orderer type which has configtx.BatchSize, configtx.Kafka, etc properties. The subproperty types should be moved to a separate orderer package within the configtx library such that they can be referenced as orderer.Kafka, orderer.BatchSize, etc. Consider if it would look better to also create new types for orderer.Policies of type map string Policy (this may not be cleanly possible since we use shared functions for all types of policies). Note this story is only for namespacing the types, no functions should be moved unless deemed necessary/more appropriate to live in the orderer subpackage.  Â   *Acceptance*  I can find a new orderer folder/package within the configtx package that contains the orderer related types for Kafka, EtcdRaft, BatchSize, ConsensusState. The new Orderer package should be well documented/have a well formed GoDoc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The fabric monolithic repository mixes user-consumable assets like the chaincode shim with internal details and dependencies of the fabric peer and orderer.  As a spike, we need to investigate some approaches to extract the user-linkable code from fabric that simplify the development process. These approaches must support semantic versioning of the shim, must not pin dependencies of the shim to versions used by the peer, and must not directly reference any internal artifacts of the fabric system. The solution must take go modules into consideration.  The result of this spike is a set of proposals on how to do this and the tradeoffs.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We want to provide basic API using Protocol Buffers over gRPC for applications to interact with the blockchain network. The API covers transaction processing, security membership services, blockchain traversal, and event handling.  Note that the current REST API is being deprecated. The reasons for going with gRPC over REST are  1) ability to control the flow with full-duplex streaming (most of API calls are asynchronous), and  2) better performance. Furthermore, the Peer doesnâ€™t have to open up more ports for HTTP/HTTPS since internally we also use gRPC for inter-component communication.  For reference, the Fabric v1.0 architecture and interaction model can be found in the attached documents in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-37  and SDK specification at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5RtIBMW9fZpli37E5Li5_Q9ve3BnQ4q3gWmGZj6Sv4/edit   ></description> </Issue>

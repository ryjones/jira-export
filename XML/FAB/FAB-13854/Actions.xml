CDATA What (probably) happens is - the follower forwards the transaction to the leader, which then sends back to the follower an acknowledgement. The acknowledgement is never read from the stream by the follower (no one calls  ReceiveSubmitResponse|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/common/cluster/rpc.go#L69  on the follower, right after calling SendSubmit) and the gRPC buffer of the stream gets full after enough acks have been accumulated. If you send the transaction to the leader, it should work. If you bring up a new follower, it should also work (until the queue to it is full).  I noticed that yesterday and already fixed it in the WIP change set ( instead of someone|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28892/2/orderer/common/cluster/rpc.go@98  calling the RPC method - I now made the RPC do this itself).  However it would take some time for the change set to be merged...  ></body> </Action>

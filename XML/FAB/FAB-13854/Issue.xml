CDATA h2. Steps to Reproduce:  Set up and run testcase scenario2 as defined in FAB-13809. h2. Observed:  A transaction broadcast from ingress OSN is never delivered to Raft OSN Leader on an application channel after serving some transactions (around 16000 transactions in many attempts) successfully. The following log is seen in ingress OSN  {code:java} 2019-01-23 18:35:53.120 UTC  orderer.consensus.etcdraft  Submit -> DEBU a0a2^  0m Forwarding submit request to Raft leader 2 {"channel": "testorgschannel1", "node": 1} {code} In this case, orderer1st-ordererorg is the ingress OSN and orderer2nd-ordererorg is the leader from the above log.  Attaching the logs for all the orderers and peer.   ^snapshot-FAB-13809-orderer1st.log    ^snapshot-FAB-13809-orderer2nd-leader.log    ^snapshot-FAB-13809-orderer3rd.log    ^snapshot-FAB-13809-peer1st.log   ^ ^goroutines-ingress-orderer-nonleader.log ^  ^^ ^goroutines-orderer2-leader.log ^^ h2. Expected:   The ingress OSN should broadcast the transaction, leader should receive the transaction and order it in the block.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu     ~scottz   ~bmos299     So my comment(s) on  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/14733 , but the net is that we don't need to continue to add additional CI jobs for every patch.   It's fine to run them separately for a short period as non-voting jobs, but at some point you need to either merge all behave tests into a single repo or minimally a single CI job.  ></body> </Action>

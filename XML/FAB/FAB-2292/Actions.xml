CDATA  ~nickgaski  how about this for consensus... I couldn't find you patch set in gerrit..  In distributed ledger technology, consensus has recently become synonymous with a specific algorithm, in a single function.  However, consensus is much more and in Hyperledger Fabric v1 consensus shows this differentiation and broad scope, and true meaning of what consensus. In a nutshell, v1 defines, consensus as the verification of the correctness of a set of transactions constituting a block. To achieve consensus it means agreement on the order and result of the transaction has occurred via a number of checks and balances through the lifecycle of any given transaction, from endorsement to commitment. These checks and balances include ESCC to verify that the endorsers agree this transaction is valid at a particular point in time. Proper orders of the transactions, and validation to avoid a double spend. MVCC & VSCC, before committing a block of transactions to the ledger, validate the results and signatures are in place, which are required from the endorsers.

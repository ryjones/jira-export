CDATA Currently the peer launches node chaincode as follows {code:java}     case pb.ChaincodeSpec_NODE:         args =   string\{"/bin/sh", "-c", fmt.Sprintf("cd /usr/local/src; node chaincode.js --peer.address %s", chaincodeSupport.peerAddress)} {code} but this is very restrictive and it would make much more sense to launch chaincode using npm start, for example {code:java} npm start -- --peer.address=.... {code} This allows for people to define the name of the script that bootstraps their chaincode implementation.  A *package.json* should be found at the root of node.js chaincode path  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA After creating the chaincode container and prior to starting it, files are copied into the filesystem. The code in {{core/container/util/}}{{writer.go}} does the following: {code:java} func WriteBytesToPackage(name string, payload   byte, tw *tar.Writer) error { 	//Make headers identical by using zero time 	var zeroTime time.Time 	tw.WriteHeader(&tar.Header{Name: name, Size: int64(len(payload)), ModTime: zeroTime, AccessTime: zeroTime, ChangeTime: zeroTime}) 	tw.Write(payload)  	return nil } {code} Notice the Mode is omitted and defaults to the 0 value. When the files show up inside the container, the permissions are too restrictive and the launched chaincode cannot read the key and certificate material that has been copied.  Setting the mode to 0100644 for those files would enable the chaincode to read them.  ></description> </Issue>

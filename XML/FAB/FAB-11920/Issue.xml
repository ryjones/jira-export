CDATA Environment:  Hyperledger Fabric v 1.1.0  When we go to Fabric CLI command prompt ( docker exec -it cli bash ) when cli container has been created, and then issue invoke or query command, which peer/node are we at? How can we find out which node/peer we are at? (The "peer node" command does not seem to have a way to provide such vital info)  More importantly, when we are at Fabric CLI command prompt, *how do we create new folder and add files to chaincode base*? For instance, if we choose -l (language) = node For the first-network (byfn) under fabric-samples for the chaincode, "mycc", it's at the following path: /opt/gopath/src/ github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node/|http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchaincode%2Fchaincode_example02%2Fnode%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEf4xD1yyoTPEW0_OHXgQCPt76PuQ   what if I want to create a new chaincode, "mycc2" and to create a new directory called "chaincode_example03" under /opt/gopath/src/ github.com/chaincode/|http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchaincode%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEYf_uPuVQPkc4aO1RXzwOv4ZLi9w   ?  under Fabric CLI command prompt we seem unable to use bash command(s) such as mkdir etc.  Other sdk do we have any flexible way to get them done?  Thanks.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the secure asset transfer and using private data examples of version 2.2, as soon as you whant to invoce the chaincode to create an asset, an error occurs. The response is:   error starting container: API error (404): network _test not found"  It seem that during the creation of the containers for the chaincode the vairable CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE is set to "__test" instead of "docker__test" because ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME} is not set.     ></description> </Issue>

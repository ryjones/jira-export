CDATA In fabric-samples/chaincode-docker-devmode, building Chaincode fails with the ccenv container created from Alpine. The go build process can't import fabric/core/chaincode/shim.  {noformat} bash-4.4# go build -o abstore abstore.go:23:2: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim" in any of: /usr/local/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim (from $GOROOT) /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim (from $GOPATH) abstore.go:24:2: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer" in any of: /usr/local/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer (from $GOROOT) /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer (from $GOPATH) {noformat}  Dev mode uses the ccenv container to build Chaincode. GOPATH in ccenv changed from "/opt/gopath" to "/go" due to the move to Alpine. However, docker-compose-simple.yaml still has `GOPATH=/opt/gopath`. For this environment variable, the go build process looks for shim package under /opt/gopath and fails to find it. GOPATH should be removed from dokcer-compose-simple.yaml to find shim package correctly.   ></description> </Issue>

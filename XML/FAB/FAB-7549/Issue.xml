CDATA I find it confusing that any time an error occurs the usage/help message gets displayed, even when the error has nothing to do with how the peer command is being called.  Help messages are useful to communicate to the user the correct usage of a command when their input isn't conform to what is supported and cannot be interpreted. Displayed for any other error they simply mislead the user into believing they made a mistake in how they called the command when that's not the case.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

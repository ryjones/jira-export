CDATA Barebones test uses samplecc which does encrytion/decryption twice and then write only. The encryption/decryption part is not needed in a Fabric test (only adds noise and complexity). In order to avoid the unnecessary parts, add test coverage for mvcc with readsets, we will use map_private chaincode in the test with `getPut` command. This will also enable testing of private data workloads by using getPutPrivate instead of getPut.  ></description> </Issue>

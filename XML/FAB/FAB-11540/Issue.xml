The pool stores the unspent tokens in an in-memory data structure, and does not communicate with any ledger. This pool can therefore be used for developing and testing the rest of the TMS, but shall not be used in production." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2018-08-10 14:46:13.0" updated="2018-09-14 14:48:11.0" resolutiondate="2018-09-14 14:47:41.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="43970"/>

CDATA The current membership infrastructure leaks information to organizations that might be confidential. Let’s assume for simplicity that we have 3 organizations: X, Y, Z and only 2 channels: A and B, and the membership of channel A is: {X, Y} and the membership of channel B is: {Y, Z} . AliveMessages and peer identities of organization X would be disseminated to organization Z although organization X and Z don’t share any channel.  It might be that organization X doesn’t want organization Z to know anything about its peers.  An additional problem exists: if X and Y are in channel A, and Y and Z are in channel B, and X and Z are in channel C, then alive messages from X reach Y and then Z, and then Z knows that X and Y have a channel (A) that Z isn't part of (B or C).  In order to tackle this - we need (probably) to fine-grain more the membership routing policies, so that each org would gossip about a foreign org, only to that foreign org.  ></description> </Issue>

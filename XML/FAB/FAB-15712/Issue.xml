CDATA Just as FAB-15710 allows orderer to join channels, they should be able to leave them. Leaving a channel should cause broadcast/deliver requests to fail, and any current deliver sessions to exit. It should also stop the consenter, and delete the ledger resources.  This API should reject all requests if a system channel is defined, unless the deletion is for the system channel.  -This API has a boolean parameter "removeStorage":- -If it is true, the ledger storage is deleted.- -If it is false, the ledger storage is moved to an archival location, to be permanently deleted by the system admin.-  The removeStorage flag is to be removed. We always delete the ledger storage.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Step 2: curl steps. a) Add a quick cmd step to verify that my curl download/install was successful. I don't know that it was. b) Running the curl -L etc. command from the directory just created above. Getting a "system cannot find the path specified" error. c) Note: For the earlier Docker steps, the --version etc. cmds worked, but some of the others test cmds, from the Docker site testing page, did not. ... e.g. docker ps "cannot find the file specified" d) I got to the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager dialog; if I needed to create a "New" VM at that time, I didn't yet; we don't explicitly say to.  d) Will return to the "What to know before you install" section on the Docker page and review: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#/what-to-know-before-you-install  ></body> </Action>

Part of this is a point in time statement for the alpha images as we run into the chaincode file permissions error.  Basically, Docker Toolbox uses VirtualBox under the covers and when you mount volumes in Docker Toolbox you end up with 777 for file permissions.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7679/  should fix this issue but unfortunately it is not included in the alpha images" created="2017-04-11 12:12:57.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2017-04-11 12:12:57.0"/>

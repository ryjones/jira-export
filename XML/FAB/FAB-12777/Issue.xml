CDATA *IMPORTANT*: The design presented here was replaced by: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15041  Goal: * Migrate an existing kafka-based ordering service to a raft-based ordering service. * Assumptions: ** The migration is one way. Once migrated to etcd/raft it will not be possible to go back to kafka. ** Downtime is allowed during the migration. * Design & implement the mechanism in the orderer node * Provide tools that automate the process * Provide documentation and guidelines * Design guideline ** Make it simple and robust ** Migration is all or nothing – if something fails in the middle, the system should be able to revert to a kafka-base functioning network.     As part of this story, we'll need to provide tooling and documentation (a very concrete set of steps) that will allow ordering service administrators to do this transition.  We want to gate this transition behind an Orderer & Channel capability.      See  High level design on Google Drive|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDSsehNR2vLf1cgZzsAjTCsoSyy0CpUg5rOb4YmXi00/edit?usp=sharing   See  Detailed design on Google Drive (work in progress) |https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_M8KO9cdbYMLBsscHd6ffv-X_ZRLeHvDcIEoV7YXUE/edit?usp=sharing   ></description> </Issue>

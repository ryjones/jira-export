CDATA *Setup*: # Uses e2ecli example. 2 org and 2 peer each ( peer0, peer1 from org 1, peer2 and peer3 from org2). Static leader selected for each organization (peer0 and peer2), while setting leader-election to false. (The compose files are attached, start with docker-compose-cli.yaml) # After the last step in e2ecli (query peer3),  disconnect the peer3 from the network via docker network disconnect.  # After 15 seconds, do another invoke operation as before (in peer0) and wait 15 seconds. # Connect back peer3 via docket network connect, and continue to query for the value.  *What was expected*: After a short duration of few seconds, query result is 80.  *What was observed*: query result remains 90 for 5 minutes (whole test duration), or in some intermittent case, becomes the expected value 80  after ~200 seconds.  ></description> </Issue>

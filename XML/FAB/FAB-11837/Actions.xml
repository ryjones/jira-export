CDATA Agreed.  And I suggest:  Use Warning level if there are 0 internal or 0 external peers detected (after initialization and then again if it goes from N back to 0).  Use Warning level if there are no anchor peers configured, and provide hint as to where it should be configured.  We will need to be careful to strike the correct balance... we don't want verbose and repeating Warning or Info log messages, but one-time messages such as the above will be helpful to provide immediate feedback, for example in scenarios where private data is not getting disseminated.  The warning messages need to be worded carefully, to not panic people that are just testing with one peer, or who don't need gossip, but convey that it will impact scenarios such as private data dissemination.  Additionally, the messages for private data push and pull failure should clearly indicate if there are 0 internal/external peers known.  ></body> </Action>

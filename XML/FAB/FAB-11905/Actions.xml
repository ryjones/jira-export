CDATA  ~yacovm   Are there any concerns about API change between releases here? Release note needed? Doc needed?  Are you advocating for this to go into v1.3 or v1.4?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It's only an API that can be consumed if someone writes their own discovery client, and imports the code from the fabric core to his/her convenience.  Bob provided a method (NewFilter) that accepts the old arguments and returns the new type, therefore the modification to the new API is trivial.  Furthermore, I see this as a good change that enhances the expression power of the endorsers selection.  Without it, you can't prioritize endorsers while looking at all possible endorsers you have.  So yes, let's merge this to v1.3 :)   ></body> </Action>

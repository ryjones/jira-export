For example, the Go SDK added a filter based on block height threshold (see FABG-755). This filter calculates the highest block height of the full set of endorsers and prioritizes the endorsers that are within a certain threshold of that block height." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-09-07 12:49:44.0" updated="2018-09-21 13:00:09.0" resolutiondate="2018-09-21 13:00:09.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="44862"/>

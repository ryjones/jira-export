CDATA A consensus implementation may need to read the ledger and extract metadata from it during operation (most likely when booting up).  As an example, the Kafka-based orderer, reads the offset of the last envelope it placed into a block *and* wrote to the local ledger, and uses that offset to resume consumption of chain's partition.  This changeset should follow up on the work of FAB-1773.  It should modify:  1. The common components `Consenter` interface so that the newly-introduced metadata field is passed on to the consensus implementations via the `HandleChain` method. 2. The `WriteBlock` method of the `ConsenterSupport` interface so that this metadata can be persisted to blocks.  This is a precursor to FAB-1623, which will add restart support to the Kafka-based orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This addresses FAB-4503 and FAB-4489 The reason for the CI failures is that apparently, closing the underlying gRPC connection doesn't always make Recv() return. https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/1293  The solution is to use context.WithCancel and use the cancel function when Disconnect or Close are called and not only close the gRPC stream.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Create a new github repository called {{fabric-protos-go}} and populate it with a {{protos}} directory that contains the fabric {{protos}}, the necessary LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md.  This repository should not be a read-only mirror of gerrit but a simple github repo.  The repository should be configured not to accept pull requests (stale-bot or settings). The fabric release managers should be configured with write access to handle "unexpected" issues that may arise.  ></description> </Issue>

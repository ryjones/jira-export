CDATA We need to configure peer with the info about the "external" chaincode, including its name, endpoint address, and root CA if using TLS. The chaincode 2.0 lifecycle model provides a good framework for a workflow to fit seamlessly with deployment model needed for deploying external chaincodes.  External chaincode will be treated as a new "Type" of chaincode called "external" (other types are "golang", "java", "node" and "system" as defined in the Fabric's proto definitions. In the chaincode lifecycle 2.0 workflow, a chaincode is packaged with other metadata in a targz file. The external chaincode is specified just as a "yaml" file with endpoint information including address and CA cert (used if TLS enabled). There is no other change to the chaincode lifecycle 2.0 workflow.   ></description> </Issue>

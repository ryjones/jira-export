<Action id="63407" issue="40796" author="denyeart" type="comment" body=" ~sykesm  I got clarification on the requirement... the orderer and peer version check is required such that channel administrators can know when a channel capability can be enabled, or when a peer can join a channel given the current channel capabilities. These administrators typically do not have access to individual peer operations/metrics. The only solution for them would be to include the orderer/peer version in the /healthz response JSON, or another unsecured endpoint. Do you have any issue with that?" created="2019-08-29 16:23:06.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2019-08-29 16:23:06.0"/>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24  hit me up on this one. He's looking for a new handler to provide version information on the operations endpoint. It should be a read-only endpoint on the service and does not require explicit authentication.  The endpoint should only support GET operations and must return a JSON document that includes the build information (likely from the common/metadata variables).  ></body> </Action>

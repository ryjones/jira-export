As the Client/SDK can/probably will be supporting multiple channels it would be beneficial to be able to receive the Block Events in the order generated across all authorized channels. To support this a synch Query via the SDK would need to accept the beginning Block Seq Id and channel for it. It would return all Block Events in timestamp order equal to and after that for all channels the Peer is authorized to.

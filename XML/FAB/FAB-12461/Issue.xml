CDATA In this item, we aim to enhance the processing capability of committing peers in token transactions with accommodating TransferFrom token transactions.  Here the owner or the delegator of a set of coins can essentially transfer a few of these tokens to one or more other users. Committing peers should ensure that the transaction creator has permissions to move these tokens and that these tokens have not been spent already. Last but not least, the committing peer would update the state of the ledger to consider the new owners for the tokens to be transferred and the old ones for the change.Â   ></description> </Issue>

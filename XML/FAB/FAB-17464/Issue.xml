CDATA Description: PTE returning success even though transaction is failed when using 2of endorsement policy.   Steps: # Launch network with 2 orgs and 1 peer in each # Create a channel, join both org peers to channel # Install any chaincode and instantiate with endorsement policy as 2of(org1,org2) # Send invokes to only org1 # Verify peer of org1 logs validation failure # After completing invokes, PTE report says successful in receiving all transaction events  As transactions are failed to commit, PTE should return error and exit as failure.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA An application can deploy a chaincode to a Peer by sending a Proposal to a Peer to deploy a chaincode. In particular, this Proposal is targetted at a special *system chaincode* called *Life Cycle Chaincode*. The life cycle chaincode manages all chaincodes deployed to a peer.   The chaincode might be associated with an Endorser System Chaincode and/or a Validation System Chaincode to provide custom exists for chaincode specific policies to be used when the chaincode simulates transactions (when processing Proposals) and when the chaincode commits transactions respectively. The fabric provides default ESCC and VSCC.  When deploy a chaincode, an endorsement validation policy may be submitted in the deployment transaction. The  validation policy is evaluated by VSCC prior to committing the transaction to the ledger.  {quote}The following diagram provides a overview of the process as far as the interactions between the application and the Endorser goes. The process's loop is completed when the transaction related to the proposal is fed back to the Committer (Endorser is also a committer) as shown in Fig 2 (LCCC_VSCC in the figure is the Validation System Chaincode for Lifcycle Chaincode) {quote}  !AdvancedDeployFlow.png|thumbnail!  *Fig 1*  !DeployCommitFlow.png|thumbnail!  *Fig 2*  ></description> </Issue>

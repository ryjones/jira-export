CDATA This may have been relevant in configtxgen but I don't know that it's relevant in the config package.  {{code}} // SkipAsForeign indicates that this org definition is actually unknown to this  // instance of the tool, so, parsing of this org's parameters should be ignored. SkipAsForeign bool {{code}}  Within our sample it reads like this:  {{code}} # SkipAsForeign can be set to true for org definitions which are to be # inherited from the orderer system channel during channel creation.  This # is especially useful when an admin of a single org without access to the # MSP directories of the other orgs wishes to create a channel.  Note # this property must always be set to false for orgs included in block # creation. SkipAsForeign: false {{code}}  If it's needed, please rationalize it here; if it's not, please remove the field and the code that references it from the config package.  ></description> </Issue>

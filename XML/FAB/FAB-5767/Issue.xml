CDATA - Binh's email to communityÂ   Hi, everyone FYI - on the scrum today, (#fabric-scum channel) we have decided to rework our errors handling by using the available package here   https://github.com/pkg/errors,   which has been vendored into the code base. Even though this package lacks of error codes, it provides the critical feature that we need -- stacktrace -- for serviceability. Using this package is 1 less thing that we have to maintain. Please follow the readme in the package to get the stacktrace for every original error in our code. If we re throw an error from our code in a different go-routine (thread), we should wrap the original error with our own error+stacktrace; otherwise, no needs to regenerate the stacktrace. Thanks, - Binh  ></description> </Issue>

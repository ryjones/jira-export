CDATA Clients often need to know which org endorsements are required for a certain key that is protected by state-based endorsement.  The interest rate swap sample for state-based endorsement can be extended to demonstrate use of ListOrgs() so that the list of required endorsing orgs can be returned to client.  Clients can then use service discovery to find the peers of the orgs.  ></description> </Issue>

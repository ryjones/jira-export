Note that the interest rate swap SBE sample does not use a client SDK application, so the ListOrgs() query can be added to the chaincode, and then the sample readme can simply mention that the returned org MSP IDs could be used by a client SDK application to find the peers associated with those orgs via service discovery.  Note that  ~jyellick  is designing a more comprehensive sample that uses SDK and state-based endorsement, so the full end-to-end sample could be included in that sample.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This story is to create a routing shim to satisfy the chaincode.Lifecycle interface defined in core/chaincode/chaincode_support.go.  It should first attempt to retrieve the chaincode definition from the new lifecycle, and if not found, it should fallback to looking for that definition in the old lscc lifecycle.  This new routing shim should be wired in place of the existing legacy lifecycle when constructing the chaincode support.  ></description> </Issue>

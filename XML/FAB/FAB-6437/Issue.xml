CDATA Refer to  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1  and the New Feature JIRA mentioned in the summary.  FAB-2331 Node JS chaincode feature: providesÂ additional implementation of chaincode that mirrors the current Golang version in functionality. The benefit is that when using the node SDK(although you can still use any SDK of your choosing) you are provided a full stack development model. This also helps the large Javascript developer community base with a familiar coding language.  We should test all APIs functionally, in nodeJS (in addition to GO language).  ></description> </Issue>

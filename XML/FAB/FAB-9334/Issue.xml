CDATA Today, each package declares a package scoped logger, rather than accepting a logger as a dependency which is injected.  Not only does this make doing things like testing tricky for verifying log messages for instance, it requires that every log message re-implement certain function.  For much of the logging, the log messages have a channel context, so each log message ends up starting with a format string like {{ channel %s }}, but, sometimes the implementer forgets to add the channel scope, or sometimes the context only needs to be aware of the channel name for the logging messages.  All of this can be fixed if the logger is injected which does the channel context automatically.  ></description> </Issue>

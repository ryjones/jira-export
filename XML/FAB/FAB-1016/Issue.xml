CDATA We Need to add send buffers to gossip comm layer. Currently the send is used by queue-ing a goroutine, which doesn't preserve FIFO order (due to not having scheduling guarantees) and also may stack too much goroutines.  This also contains a small but important fix to the handshake test in the comm tests, that sometimes fails the test.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This test case has been executed on IKS k8s environment with July 13th build. Observed the fix is working as expected.  NOTE: While instantiation, ccenv latest image is getting pulled from docker hub, as it is expecting: latest tag. So, it always pulls whatever the : latest image is available on the docker hub but this may not be current release branch code ( meaning 1.4.2). So, I have followed the below steps  1. Exec into the peer where I suppose to instantiating the chaincode. 2. Pull the ccenv:amd64-stable image from nexus which got published by daily release jobs. 3. re-tag above pulled image to :latest  repeat the same steps in other peer container pods.  ></body> </Action>

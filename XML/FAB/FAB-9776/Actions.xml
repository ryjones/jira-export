<Action id="43612" issue="29795" author="denyeart" type="comment" body=" ~yacovm  Good find, at the same time we should also check other types of unexpected validation errors and ensure they won&apos;t lead to forks. As you are refactoring vscc as a validation plugin for v1.2, you can fix as part of that work item in master.  So that leaves v1.1 and v1.0.  I agree this is important enough to fix in both of those releases.  I think maybe  ~ales  is most familiar with this code in v1.1 and v1.0.  I&apos;ll set Fix Version and assignee as such, but speak up if somebody disagrees." created="2018-04-28 14:16:20.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-04-28 14:34:33.0"/>

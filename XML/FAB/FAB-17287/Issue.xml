CDATA The types section of  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/developapps/wallet.html  needs updating to match the new wallet API and structure in v2.0 of the Node (and Java) SDK. The key differences are: * Wallet types are defined only by their backing store, not by the type (HSM or non-HSM) of identity they hold. * There are three wallet types: file system, in-memory and CouchDB. * All wallet types can hold both HSM and non-HSM identities. * All of the wallet types are created using factory function on the new Wallets class. Individual implementation classes are not exposed.     All of the above information is captured on a new tutorial page in the SDK docs:  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/tutorial-wallet.html   Hyperlinks to wallet information on that page are all out-of-date. Node SDK documentation is now located at  https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/   ></description> </Issue>

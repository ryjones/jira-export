CDATA Here we assume that the peer's administrator has a local copy of the configuration of the local MSP that he/she wishes to modify, and send to the peer with which to update its own local MSP configuration. The peer stores the new configuration locally, and reloads the local MSP using the received configuration.  Considerations include: * How to ensure that the peer will start with a valid local MSP configuration, in the case that it crashes while updating the local MSP configuration files * Initially, we assume that the peer's administrator has a local copy of the local MSP configuration. Is necessary/desirable to also add functionality for retrieving the current local MSP configuration from the peer?  ></description> </Issue>

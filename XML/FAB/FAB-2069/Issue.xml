One way to authenticate such messages is that the peer checks the signature against all channel MSPs/readers. Another way would be that there is an automated way of updating some central MSPManager structure. Last but not least, we could allow for ConnectionEstablished messages go unauthenticated till the scope of the messages they include is revealed." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-02-06 18:07:21.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:56:05.0" resolutiondate="2017-02-22 07:18:00.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="37312"/>

CDATA The  github.com/milagro-crypto/amcl library used by idemix does not follow standard Go packaging and therefore does not work with dep.  The issue is that you actually need to download the code and then build specific packages for the curves you want to use.  dep actually makes checks against the Git repos and fails because the generated packages do not live in the repo.   ></description> </Issue>

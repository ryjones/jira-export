CDATA  ~muralisr   Definitely, srinivasan.  As we collect the feedback from recent meetups, the java chaincode feature really attracts lots of attention.  I hope the removal of FSM in golang side can be done soon, then the team can start the java cc support feature. @ ~gujingxiao .  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~baohua   ~alexcrownus  sorry for delayed response... removing the FSM in the chaincode support side in the peer should have no effect on the chaincode. In fact the FSM removal has made great progress and have been tested with both GO and Java chaincodes. The GO chaincode also removed FSM but I deliberately left the Java chaincode alone to prove that both sides are independent and removing the fSM on the peer side will have no impact on the chaincode side.  However all this work came too late for 1.1 and is now currently slated for 1.2. Given that we can remove the FSM from Java side any time we want I'd recommend continuing with feature upgrade to the Java chaincode and completing the work.  ( ~sanchezl  )  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~Clayton Sims ,  ~baohua ,  ~alexcrownus ,  ~muralisrini ,  ~sanchezl   I would really love to have the java chaincode available as soon as possible. There are multiple libraries written in Java that we could leverage to support chaincode development. Is there a plan when this will be released? May I help in some way? :)  ></body> </Action>

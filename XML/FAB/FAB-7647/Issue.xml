CDATA Test name: Performance test: latency Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with levelDB     chaincode: chancode, sample_cc, instantiated     transactions: 1 thread, each thread sends 10000 invokes concurrently          thread 1 sends to org1 peer1  Network Topology: docker containers; 1 channel, 1 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 1 ca, TLS enabled, batch size = 1, event service: channel, listener: block Client Driver: PTE (latency mode) Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error     each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

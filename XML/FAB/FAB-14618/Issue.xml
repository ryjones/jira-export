CDATA Presently, the TLS certificates are specified in the channel config, then replicated into every block metadata persisted to disk.  Because the TLS certificates are non-trivial in size (and there may be many raft nodes) this presents a significant amount of wasted space.  Because there is a set of Raft nodes specified in the channel config, all we need to know is how to map those certs in the channel config to the underlying Raft IDs.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA For networks with the v1.2 capability enabled, they should use the new lifecycle, which means they should use a new VSCC which does not have any specific 'LSCC" checks in it.  The new VSCC must enforce whatever is required of the new ESCC for exactly once init semantics, but this will be common for all chaincodes.  Note, the new default VSCC should be given a sane name.  Something like "exactly-once-init-static-endorsement-policy" or similar.  Even "EOISEP" would be a superior name to "VSCC".  ></description> </Issue>

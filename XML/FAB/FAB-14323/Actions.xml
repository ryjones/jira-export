CDATA  ~sykesm  - Is this actually what we want?  {{*/healthz*}} does not require a client cert when just TLS is enabled. If this is the case, then I think we need to update the documentation as this is not clear.  ></body> </Action>

When TLS is enabled, we request a client cert for authentication and, if provided, we verify it against the configured CA. If a cert isn’t provided, authorization will be denied to the logging and metrics handlers. Only health is treated as special and it’s called out explicitly in that section:  {quote} When TLS is enabled, a valid client certificate is not required to use this service unless requireClientAuth is set to true. {quote}  And when requireClientAuth is set, health needs it too - which is why I’m not really happy to see that the doc was updated to say we _recommend_ enabling mutual auth since it breaks the default readiness and licenses checks.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~sykesm  ... that's what all the tests show so makes sense.  {quote} Note that if clientAuthRequired is set to false, clients do not need to provide a certificate; if they do, however, and the service cannot verify the certificate, then the request will be rejected. {quote}  So I don't think that the above if actually accurate .... let me see how I can improve    ></body> </Action>

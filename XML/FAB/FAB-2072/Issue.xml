CDATA This is a proposal on how to enhance peer API to support updates to local MSP without requiring the peer to (re-)boot.  In the future this API can be extended to configure other aspects of a peer's operation.  We aim to fully support this capability via extending CSCC with an "updateMSP" function, in three stages: # At the first stage we assume that the peer's admin is able to create in the peer's filesystem a folder to include the new msp configuration; subsequently the peer's admin would only need to request the peer to reload its local msp from this folder (FAB-6254) # At a second stage, the peer's admin would pass to the peer the entire new msp configuration and ask from the peer to load msp updates from the request's arguments (FAB-7249) # Adjust the way gossip advertises the gossip identifier of the peer (PKI-ID) in a way that can be renewed when the signing identity of the peer is renewed (as part of its local MSP update). This FAB design is still in progress.  In both cases, the peer would need to update its .yaml file with the updated msp information.        ></description> </Issue>

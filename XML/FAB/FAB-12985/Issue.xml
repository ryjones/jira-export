CDATA This task focuses on testing the consensus-type migration "abort" path, that was introduced in FAB-13245.  The main contribution is in adding two test cases to  migration_test.go,   The two test-cases are: # A test that executes the migration abort-path flow on the Kafka side (from START-TX, via ABORT-TX until another START-TX), on the system channel only. # A test that executes the migration abort-path flow on the Kafka side (from START-TX, CONTEXT-TX via ABORT-TX until another START-TX), on the system channel and a single application channel.   The tests are somewhat overlapping but are verifying different aspects of the expected behavior. Overall, the tests verify that the flow of: * START-TX => CONTEXT-TX (x #std-channels)=> ABORT-TX => (optional NONE-TX), system remains on kafka * START-TX => CONTEXT-TX (x #std-channels)=> ABORT-TX => START-TX ... => normal migration flow until restart on to Raft     ></description> </Issue>

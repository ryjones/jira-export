CDATA The channel configuration is currently processed via the configtx package.  This is actually a conflation of responsibilities, as the configtx package should be concerned about permission to modify a configuration, not the actual contents of the change.  This CR creates a new channel config bundle, which will ultimately hold an immutable copy of the channel configuration.  For the time being, it implements a poor man's parsing of the policy tree.  This temporary parsing will be removed in the future in favor of more robust parsing once the mutability notion has been removed from the policy manager.  ></description> </Issue>

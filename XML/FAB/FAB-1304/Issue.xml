CDATA The orderer currently relies on its own rawledger implementations, a simple ram based ledger (which does not persist anything to disk) and a simple file based ledger which uses a very naive JSON encoding with 1 block per file.  Neither of these are likely to scale well for real systems and have always been intended to be testing tools while the real ledger is developed.  A shim needs to be written between the orderer rawledger API and the fabric ledger api to support deploying with the fabric backing ledger for production deployments.  ></description> </Issue>

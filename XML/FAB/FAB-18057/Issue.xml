CDATA An orderer node that is a member or a follower of a channel may go down for a long time. When it wake up, in most cases it will be able to pull the blocks its missed and catch up with the cluster. However, in rare cases, the config of the channel  may have changed so much such that the restored node no longer has the ability to pull.  The simple, but possibly costly solution, is to remove the channel and join from scratch with a recent config block.  However, a better solution is to supply the orderer with a more recent config block to the channel in order to allow it to catch-up. This would probably have to be implemented with another REST verb like a {{`PUT`}} (vs `POST` for Join) to perform an {{`Update`}}.  That is:  PUT /channels/channel-name   with body carrying a join-block.  If the join-block.number is smaller or equal than the ledger height, the request is rejected.  If it is higher, it is placed in the joinblock file repo, the current chain or follower are stopped, and a new follower is started.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA One of the bits not covered by FAB-16599 was to add an externalbuilder for use with legacy chaincodes.Â  Likely we could restore some version of the removed golang external builder.  This covers two cases which are important to support for migration purposes (1) the use of the legacy lifecycle and external builders, and (2) the loading of external builder metadata in the legacy chaincode context.  ></description> </Issue>

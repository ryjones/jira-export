(2) Using a separate thread, stop the first kafka broker, wait for 30 seconds, and then restart it. wait for 2 minutes, followed by other kafka brokers as well (3) Reconnect the broadcast clients to send the transactions and deliver clients to receive both before and after the orderer restarted * *Artifact Locations*: fabric/test/tools/OTE * *Network Topology*: 3 orderers, 4 kafka brokers, 3 zookeepers, 2 orgs with 2 peers in each * *Client Driver*: OTE * *Input*: go test -run ORD94 -timeout 50m * *Output*: if the test ran successfully, should be able to see pass as the output  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a matter of fact, I just started working again on it this weekend. Testing with the latest MSYS2 and Cygwin environments to see if I can get something working.  So far, it seems that the situation has improved - especially the latest make command seems to work better - but there still are issues making this to work a challenge.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The latest version of make I could find on Windows makes the build a bit less painful but I'm definitely not yet close to getting this to work.  If anyone has a desire to take this on, feel free to reassign it to yourself. Otherwise I will keep trying it every now and then as time permits.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We really do not claim support at all for building on Windows ... although it should work on Windows 10 with the Ubuntu env they provide.  In master / 2.0 and later, you can at least more easily build Docker images simply running `docker build ...`  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm happy to report that the combination of the simplification of our Makefile and the improvement in the tools available on Windows means that I was able to build Fabric on Windows 7.  I have had success using the following MSYS2 distribution with a twist on how to launch docker toolbox so that it uses that environment rather than the default git one.   https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation   I will submit an update to the doc to document it and we can close this long standing ticket!  ></body> </Action>

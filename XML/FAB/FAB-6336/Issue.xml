CDATA We will propose two new extended API functions for Fabric's performance improvement, which has already been presented at P2PFISY2017.  Differential Update State (DUS) : an API function in which differential update operation (e.g. A:=A+X or A:=A-X) is executed in the peer side, allowing users to reduce the number of API functions they used in their chaincodes.  Compound Request (CR) : an API function in which multiple existent API functions are merged into one, allowing users to reduce the number of API functions they used in their chaincodes again.  We have already evaluated its efficiency for v0.6.1, where two extended API functions improve Fabric's transaction rate from 725tps to 1,350tps (86% increased). We are now evaluating it for v1.0.  ></description> </Issue>

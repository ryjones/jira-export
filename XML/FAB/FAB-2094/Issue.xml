CDATA Assumptions we need to document:  1) Certificate expiration.  Here we decided to go for real-time being used to assess whether a certain certficate is valid or not.  The assumption is that the certificates are renewed way before they expire, e.g., a month before such that the clock skew of the committing peers will not be affected by this. This item is here to ensure that this assumption is properly stated into the MSP document.  2) MSP Identifier.  Here we need to assume that the MSPidentifier is set upon agreement among the application participants. In the future orderers are to enforce this, via the identity channel but currently we assume that the admins of the chain have properly investigated the MSPs they allow to appear in the chain including a correctness check on the mapping between MSP identifiers and configuration. It may as well be that the MSPIdentifier is taken after an MSP's administrator.  3) Distinction between clients and peers. This is deemed not to be critical for now but we should add to the MSP document best-practices when distinction between the two is necessary.    ></description> </Issue>

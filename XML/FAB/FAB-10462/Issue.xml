CDATA The discovery access control checks for channel readers, however - if the channel admins want to enforce that only admins or peers can pull blocks from the orderer/peers, they would set the reader policy to be OR(admin, peer) and that blocks every client from using service discovery.  It would make sense to change the policy that is checked to be channel application writers instead of readers, since if you should be allowed to use an endorsement (write to the channel) you should also be allowed to see who are the peers that you should endorse to.   ></description> </Issue>

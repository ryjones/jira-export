CDATA We need to make necessary changes in the core/chaincode/handler.go for pagination. Currently, the handler.go in the peer calls the ledger to execute queries (range query, rich query). On an execution of a query, the ledger returns an iterator. Using the iterator, peer constructs the query response with records and send the response to chaincode.  When a pagination is enabled (i.e., when the query metadata is passed with pageSize and a bookmark for range/rich queries), the peer would call the new pagination enabled range/rich query APIs at ledger which would return a response metadata in addition to an iterator. The response metadata would contain the next bookmark and the number of records fetched for the query. Peer retrieves all fetched records from ledger, constructs a query response including both records and response metadata. The chaincode can pass on the bookmark in the response metadata to the application/sdk.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Launch pte threads processes inside k8s cluster containers instead of on local machine wherever tests are started (which may be a small capacity VM). Doing this should increase performance significantly, or at least eliminate a potential bottleneck that could prevent stress load testing.  Integrate this option into the k8s launcher tool to be done automatically. Document this appropriately. Also, ensure the user can see the pte logs.  This will require retrieving data from all the pte containers to be put together and reported at the end of the test.  It also may be easier after standardizing a report structure with FAB-16167.  ></description> </Issue>

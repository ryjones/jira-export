CDATA Given the ledger provider stores the genesis blocks upon join (see FAB-10141), it will now be possible to rebuild or copy a peer by simply copying the ledger provider (/ledgersData/ledgerProvider directory).  This work item will add the logic to take the genesis blocks from the ledger provider and automatically create the corresponding ledgers including block stores, state db, etc.  Peer admins will then be able rebuild or copy a peer without having to re-join all the peer's channels. The existence of the genesis block in the ledger provider will enable automatic join and automatic ledger creation upon initial peer start.  ></description> </Issue>

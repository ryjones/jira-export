CDATA This was reported by  ~angelo.decaro .   So far, it was not enforced that admin certificates are valid identities for the MSP they are responsible for, i.e., have a certificate that is signed by one of the CAs considered in the MSP (see,  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/msp-identity-validity-rules.rst  for more information on MSP identity validity). This could cause issues when this admin is requested to read content of a certain channel (default policies allow read-access to only members of the MSPs of a certain channel), or the admin is requested to be revoked.   Currently, the process followed when revoking an admin would depend on whether an admin is a valid identity for that MSP: * if the admin is valid identity for the MSP it refers to, revocation of its certificate is performed in two steps: i) the admin's cert is removed from the admins part of MSP configuration (removing the role of admin from the specific certificate), and ii) the admin's cert is added to the CRL of its parent CA.  * if the admin is not a valid identity for the MSP it refers to, revocation of the admin w.r.t. that MSP only requires removal of the admin's cert from the MSP's admins.   A suggested solution is to force that the admin's certificate is a valid identity for that MSP according to  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/msp-identity-validity-rules.rst .  ></description> </Issue>

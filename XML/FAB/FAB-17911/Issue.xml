CDATA An orderer without channels joins the system channel. It must be a member of the system channel cluster as well. # The join-block is saved to the join-block filerepo. # If the join-block.number=0, it is appended to the ledger. # A degenerate ChainSupport is created, holding an inactive.Chain within, and set into the chains map and the "systemChannel" field. This is done to prevent further invocations to the API from issuing conflicting commands, as they will find a system channel there. Only "List" and "Remove" will be accepted. Transactions sent to the system channel will be rejected. # As soon as the Join REST call returns successfully the orderer should be restarted. # Upon restart, (boostrapMethod="none") 'Main' will look for a system channel join block, and if it finds one, will treat it as a bootstrap block. # Normal boot then resumes, and the orderer will on-board (replicate) the system channel and any channel referred by it, just as if we hadÂ boostrapMethod="file" with the same block as bootstrap block. # After replication ends, the system channel join block is removed. # The orderer now operates in the "legacy" system channel mode.  ></description> </Issue>

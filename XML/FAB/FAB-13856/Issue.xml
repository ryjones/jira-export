CDATA An admin decides to increase the number of OSNs in the system channel and an application channel, and starts the new orderer using configuration blocks containing all the necessary updates. h2. Setup # Create a network and run a minimum of 10,000 transactions, as in FAB-13601.  h2. Inputs # Onboard O4 to the {{orderersystemchannel}}: ## Fetch latest config block of {{orderersystemchannel}}. ## Edit to add O4. ## Sign and submit the config update to O1. ## Fetch latest config block again and use it as genesis block for O4 in path ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE. # Onboard O4 to the application channel, {{channel1}}: ## Fetch latest config block of {{channel1}}. ## Edit {{channel1}} config to add O4. ## Sign and submit the channel update transaction to O1. # Start O4, using the latest config block. # *Verify* O4 participates in the {{orderersystemchannel}} by ensuring the debug logs contain "leader changed" to the appropriate orderer for the {{orderersystemchannel}}. # *Verify* O4 participates in the application {{channel1}} by ensuring the debug logs contain "leader changed" to the appropriate orderer for the {{channel1}}. # Watch O4 {{channel1}} block height grow as it retrieves blocks from O1 and/or O2 and/or O3. # Once O4 catches up, send another transaction through O4 and verify that new block is added to all the OSNs as well as the peer ledger.  h2. Expectations # Verify all blocks in {{channel1}} are retrieved by O4. # Observe the rate, how long it takes to catch up. # All nodes remain in service throughout the test. # No errors in the logs of peers and orderers. # No failures or errors reported by PTE.   ></description> </Issue>

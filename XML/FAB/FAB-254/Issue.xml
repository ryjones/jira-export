CDATA This initial phase is to send to an orderer based on SOLO. The API should take a proper parameter assembled from the returned data of the sendDeploymentProposal() call, and send to the orderer for consensus, which will then deliver to committers for validating and committing to ledger.  Note that the event notification on transaction "complete", "error" will be tracked separately.  ></description> </Issue>

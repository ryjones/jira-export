CDATA Moved over from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/1305   {quote}We are currently based on 14.04 LTS. The new LTS 16.04 was released recently and we should evaluate whether rebasing the various platforms (vagrant, docker, etc) make sense. One benefit that comes to mind is a few packages that we have to build by hand (go1.6) might become available via official Ubuntu supported avenues.  One particular snafu is I am unsure if 16.04 is available in TravisCI. I suspect its only a matter of time if it is not supported already, but this would be largely out of our control. I cannot predict what might happen if we target 16.04 but certain environments are held back on older releases.{quote}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The channel update code will return an error message like:  {noformat} Update not for correct channel: foo for bar {noformat}  Which is fairly easy to understand if both channel IDs are set, but in particular if 'foo' is empty, the error message reads very oddly.  In addition to the quoting, making the error message a little more verbose like:  "ConfigUpdate for channel 'foo' but envelope for channel 'bar'.  would be helpful.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I do not expect java chaincode developers to declare snapshot as a dependency in theirs pom.xml, simply because those jars never goes to the Maven Central, therefore a priory non resolvable and not part of javaenv image.   Saying this, I do agree we need to develop a mechanism to detect such missing dependency and abort before hitting timeout.  ></body> </Action>

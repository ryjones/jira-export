CDATA Similar to FAB-1065, the only difference is that it has to elect the leader per channel and not per org.  Implement peer leader election within a channel gossip group, such that, at any moment, we may call Peer.IsLeader(chainID) to learn whether the peer is the leader or not (true|false result). Consider cases such as leader dies, network partitions.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The Go SDK has officially released beta support for the new high level programming model. Now that this is available we should consider creating a Go-based tool for performing network operation and testing purposes.  The Operator tooling is written in Go, as well as Fabric itself. To make use of the larger fabric ecosystem, it now makes sense to write a tool for drive traffic and operations in Go. This tooling will be a part of the larger Operator ecosystem.  This story will encapsulate all of the necessary work to create a Go PTE.  Acceptance criteria: I can run E2E system tests purely using Go.      ></description> </Issue>

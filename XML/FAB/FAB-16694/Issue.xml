CDATA This code  {code:java} 	if txAction == nil { 		return nil, errors.New("nil action") 	} {code} in parser.go is untested because of the inability to produce a proto message with a repeated field with a nil element,  At this stage it's not clear whether it's a hard impossibility for protobufs in general or there's a way to craft such message manually even though the go marshaler won't produce it. This work tracks the work required to either code that test or remove that check  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  |https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/orderer/ordering_service.html#raft-concepts   ^RAFT-ReadOnlyQuery-QuorumIssue.pdf https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/orderer/ordering_service.html#raft-concepts  "If a quorum of nodes is unavailable for any reason, the ordering service cluster becomes unavailable for both read and write operations on the channel, and no new logs can be committed."  Customer is seeing read-only query succeeding in their testing. I explain the reasoning as in attached documentation and perhaps we can improve the documentation to state explicitly.  Â   Customer wants a reference to an example that shows how to submit a read-only query for ordering - so auditors can be satisfied. Thanks.  ></description> </Issue>

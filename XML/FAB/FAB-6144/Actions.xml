CDATA  ~scottz  Could you please let me know what tests we have run on IS_RELEASE = TRUE condition.  FYI:  In the current fabric-ci process, we run below tests on every patch set submitted to fabric repository * smoke tests (fabric-test repository) * unit-tests (fabric) * behave tests * e2e tests which covers (fabric-sdk-node e2e tests, fabric e2e cli tests, fabric-sdk-java e2e tests)  And we run fabric-daily job every day on latest fabric and fabric-ca commits. Based on what we run on every patch set on fabric repository, let's plan what tests we have to run before "Release Engineer" create a release tag.  Also, we can leverage the existing release tests (verifies peer, orderer, etc.. binary version and pull recent published docker images (fabric, fabric-ca), run e2e tests from fabric CLI, byfn tests (default channel, custom channel and couchdb) and make targets (make native, make release-all, make docker etc..) also runs fabric-test smoke tests.  ></body> </Action>

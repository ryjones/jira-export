CDATA Dear Community,  I've been working around with Fabric for a a few months now, and I've been trying to run a somewhat complex virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine within a chaincode. It is written in JavaScript so I worked with the nodeJS chaincode version.  I packed the the VM with my chaincode in a directory that i install and instantiate onto the peer. The install completes and exits with no errors, however the instantiation after hanging for a few minutes returns me an error:    {code:java} Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = timeout expired while starting chaincode mychaincode:1.0(networkid:dev,peerid:peer0.org1.example.com,tx:.... {code}  It should run for quite a few minutes at least as the added packages are ~15MB, according to the example nodejs chaincode runs for a minute at least.     The example nodejs chaincode (chaincode_example02) runs perfectly on both BYFN network from the tutorial and on a basic-network that I've started. My environment was set up according to the documentation (v1.1.0) from the fabric-samples repository (v1.1.0). Even if I only add one package to the example chaincode with the require method, it hangs, than return error.  I've been searching for a flag or config where I can set the timeout value for chaincode instantiation, but with no luck. Where could I increase the timeout value? Which log should I provide to search for the soution?  Thanks is advance,  Balint  ></description> </Issue>

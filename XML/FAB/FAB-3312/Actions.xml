CDATA Here we need to understand, whether the following would make sense and apply them: 1. CAs in the CA hierarchy be considered valid identities of that MSP? (currently they are not) 2. enforce that an admin's certificate has a signature from one of the considered CAs? (currently it is not enforced) 3. in cases where intermediate CAs are present, exclude nonCA certificates signed directly by the root? (currently, we do not exclude them)   ~adc ,  ~ales ,  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~keithsmith  what do you think for 1-3?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This should be for clients based on channel membership. (See configtx.yaml file) After performing a config update, the CAs should be dynamically updated.  The environment var - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES=/data/tls/ca_root.pem  is set using the client's organization certificate. The root CAs from the other organizations should be added to the RootCA list dynamically in code. Such that there is no need to add the RootCA certificate file for all organizations to the environment variable.  We need to verify on a network with mutual TLS turned off initially, then turned on and verify that mutual TLS is attained.  Questions: - How can I verify that the node has the updated RootCA list besides the ability to communicate with a node in a separate organization? Look in the config update block.  ></description> </Issue>

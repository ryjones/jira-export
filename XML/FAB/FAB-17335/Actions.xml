CDATA I did include some information in this doc about adding orgs, but as it's a topic about editing channels and only briefly goes into detail about the the kinds of things that can be edited I didn't add more about channel MSPs or org definitions (deeper dives into that information are better left to other docs, imo).  That being said, these are such important parts of a channel config it might make sense to include more info about them specifically, even if this information might eventually make its way to a more dedicate topic on those things.  ></body> </Action>

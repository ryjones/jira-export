CDATA There's been confusion about why we provide both a 'Latest' and 'Master' version of the docs:   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/    https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/   Our understanding is that they are identical and that the 'Latest' version of the docs simply points to the 'master' version. Is there a business need to have both versions? If not could we remove one of them?  ></description> </Issue>

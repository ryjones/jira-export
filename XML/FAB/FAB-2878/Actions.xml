CDATA This is true, but unfortunately the phantom check is much more complicated for rich query than range query, since the CouchDB query engine cannot easily be reproduced in peer.  This would require pushing each tran in the block to CouchDB one by one during validation phase, and re-executing the rich queries.  This also brings potential issues if the tran needs to get rolled back.  For these reasons, in v1 it is documented that rich query should not be used when identifying keys to update in chaincode, unless the client application can either ensure no phantoms or deal with phantoms in subsequent transactions. The documented recommendation is to perform range queries or partial composite key queries to identify keys to update, and to use rich queries for read-only queries.  Adding to fabric-ledger backlog for consideration in future releases.  ></body> </Action>

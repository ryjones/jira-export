This behaviour must not change with the state-based validator. However, we cannot adopt the 1.2 behaviour of always checking the chaincode EP as that would invalidate the premise of state-based endorsement. The following approach is taken: the state-based validator will always validate the chaincode endorsement policy in case the transaction did not require checking any other endorsement policy (notably, any state-based one)." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-08-30 13:33:33.0" updated="2018-09-04 16:08:24.0" resolutiondate="2018-09-04 16:08:24.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="44646"/>

CDATA  ~aviralwal  - This is not actually a bug.  If a peer goes down, then you are correct that all of the chaincode containers for that peer also go down as well.  But one the peer is back up, if you invoke/query the chaincode on that peer, then the peer will actually launch / start the chaincode again.  I agree that it would be better if the peer actually re-launched all chaincode containers automatically, so I'm going to mark this as an improvement  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Fabric v1.1 with kafka consensus mechanism.  Production environment  ></environment> <description><! CDATA    I had 6 peer containers running, 3 for each organisation. Out of 2 , 1 was admin and 2 were user containers. Now I had deployed a chaincode on it and the deployment was successful.  Now once the chaincode was successfully deployed, after some time, the peer through which the chaincode was deployed went down. This caused the chaincode to also go down.   Since the chaincode was deployed using composer, I tried redeploying it but the peer was giving the error :- The chaincode already exists. The chaincode was present inside the peer in /var/hyperledger/production/chaincode  Also if I tried to bring up the chaincode container up manually, the peer did not allow it and gave error that chaincode cannot be invoked externally(it can be done in dev mode).  This behaviour is not good because If the peer somehow goes down, the chaincode wont be invoked automatically. This should happen automatically.  If any more information is required, Kindly inform me.   ></description> </Issue>

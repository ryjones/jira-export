CDATA When a peer receives a data message (contains a block) it doesn't verify that the sequence of the block matches the sequence inside the marshaled block, and just calls  VerifyBlock | https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/api/crypto.go#L35 .  I propose to extend the interface VerifyBlock with a sequence number. * The  implementation | https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/gossip/mcs.go#L120  already unmarshals the block, so there is no point in un-marshalling it outside. * I don't want to create a dependency between all places where we receive blocks from peers in gossip, so passing the sequence number would preserve the existing state.   ~C0rWin   ~angelo.decaro   ></description> </Issue>

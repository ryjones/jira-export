CDATA In the current implementation of the join channel message in the gossip layer, each anchor peer has its own organization, and the joinChannel invocation enumerates all anchor peers and builds a list of organizationIDs from them.  When https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7105/ will be introduced, it will be needed to create a channel only with either no anchor peers or anchor peers of the organization of the channel creator. This would confuse the gossip layer because it'll derive that each channel has only 1 organization instead of the original participants.   If I decouple the orgs from the anchor peers, this would solve the problem.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Notes on how this works:   `org.hyperledger.fabric.contract.execution.SerializerInterface` should be implemented; this can has 3 methods that are required setTypeRegistry() will let the serializer query information about the classes that have been marked with `@DataType` and also the properties.   Details of the type that is being serialized will be passed to the other methods.   `toBuffer` and `fromBuffer` are fairly simple to describe - to and from a byte buffer format of the object... the TypeSchema is also passed that gives information on what needs to be handled.    The serializer also needs to be marked with `@Serlializer` that identifies a unique name (within the running container), you can also scope this as to when it is used.   For examples in how to write your own, best to view the JSONTransactionSerializer in the codebase.    The Contract annotation has an additional couple of properties to say what serializer should be used. This defaults to JSON as per the current codebase.      ></body> </Action>

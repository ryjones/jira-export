CDATA We run several channels with 3 chaincodes having endorsement policies like  ORG1 & OUTOF(7, ORG2..ORG14)  ORG1 has two endorsing peers, others have single.     Transactions are produced by gateway software fabric-sdk-go v1.0.0-beta1 with dynamic discovery on.   At some point of time peer process start consuming all cpu . Load doesn’t end at turning off of gateway software of that org. CPU load spike doesn't start immediately.    Attaching trace of peer process during this problem.   Probably Discovery shouldn’t try to build all possible combinations of endorsing peers and just return N variants to save CPU and bandwidth?        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA According to fabric documentation, it is said to be modular, to have a pluggable consensus etc...but  We couldn't find in any docs, any information about what are the steps to follow to add support for any other kind of state persistency mechanism. I mean, currently leveldb and couchdb are supported, but we would like to know how a new state can be implemented using lets say other software such as redis, mongodb, etc.  We think the clear step is to download fabric latest core and make the required modifications, but is there any documentation about it? How we should proceed?  ></description> </Issue>

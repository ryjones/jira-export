CDATA In times, we would want to update the TLS certificate of a server node such as a peer or an orderer.     Reasons could vary starting from the certificate is nearing expiration, or changing root TLS ca to adding a new SAN to the certificate because of some routing rule.  Currently there is no way to do that without a shutdown of the node, and that's too bad.  We should provide a way to update the TLS certificate on the fly.      ~mastersingh24   ></description> </Issue>

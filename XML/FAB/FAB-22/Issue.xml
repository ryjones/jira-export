CDATA Developer must have the ability to manage the lifecycle of their chaincode, from beginning to end. So that they can modify, apply fixes and migrate her chaincode.  Chaincode lifecycle management  Description Provide a way to manage chaincode lifecycle. Need for basic support of scenarios such as modify deployed chaincode, migration of chaincode (and activities such as backup of data related to it) etc.   We may also want to consider version support as part of this effort.

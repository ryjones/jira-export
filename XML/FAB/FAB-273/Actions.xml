CDATA We were successfully able to integrate fabric-baseimage builds for the z Systems (s390x) platform in the production Jenkins environment.  Release (v0.2.1) was pushed to Docker Hub.  Regarding the integration of fabric builds for the s390x platform into the CI pipeline, I believe that https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-358 needs to be resolved first.  Otherwise, fabric builds for verify, merge, etc. will continue to fail due to the FAB-358 issue.  ></body> </Action>

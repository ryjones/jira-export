CDATA  ~chris.elder  Can you expand on the problem?  I thought we were ok since GetVersion() would be called during validation of block N, values would get updated during commit of block N, and then cache would be cleared before next call of GetVersion() during validation of block N+1.  Note, cache is getting cleared in this CR: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12669/4/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/lockbased_txmgr.go.  ></body> </Action>

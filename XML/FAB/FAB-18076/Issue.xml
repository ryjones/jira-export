CDATA Rewrite the Registrar.Initialize() flow: - Discover and load join-blocks. If there is a join-block, there must be a ledger; if there is none, create it. - Discover all ledgers. This should already include all channels with join blocks as well. - Scan for and initialize the system channel, if it exists. - Make sure there are no empty ledgers without a corresponding join-block. Note that there may be channels with empty ledgers, but always with a join block. - Initialize application channels, by creating either a consensus.Chain or a follower.Chain. - Start all channels.   ></description> </Issue>

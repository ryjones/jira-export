CDATA We need a video to introduce people to Fabric now that it's actually gotten to 1.0 (and beyond) in an enterprise ready state. This would be a high level video about *why* and *what* HF is, not *how* it works, focusing on the current-world problem that HF solves (rather than merely presenting it as a neat innovation). It would be brief (about three minutes or so), fun, and lively.  I've included a shot list/narration to give an idea of what I mean. Any and all comments welcome.  ></description> </Issue>

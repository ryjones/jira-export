CDATA h2. Context Dynamic onboarding test scenario FAB-13702 requires creating a network with 4 or more orderers, with just 3 of those included in application {{channel1}}. Despite correctly configuring the Raft consenters orderers in the Profiles section of {{configtx.yaml}}, when {{channel1}} gets created it contains the same orderers as in the system channel (all of them).  h2. Explanation Apparently, in channel creation, {{configtxgen}} simply ignores everything that is not an immediate child of the {{Application}} section of {{configtx.yaml}}.  h2. Expected For example, when using the attached {{configtx.yaml}}, the consenters {{orderer4th-ordererorg}} and {{orderer5th-ordererorg}} should not be members of any channel based on {{Profiles:OrgChannel}}.  h2. Observed All channels created with this profile do in fact contain all 5 orderers.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are 11 behave tests that can be executed when merging CRs by running `behave -t smoke`. There are also 43 behave tests that can be executed during daily test runs by executing `behave -t daily`.  Auction tests have been integrated as well, but I'm not sure that they are ready to be used during daily run tests.  ~sandp125  can speak on this more.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I see dailytests (ledger) tests are failing with the patch mismatches.. I think this has to be fixed in fabric-test repository.  Able to run behave (smoke and daily) tests. Tested in Jenkins sandbox and observed one of the daily test case is failing and smoke tests are working as expected.  ></body> </Action>

Now for every patch set we run set of smoke tests and update the result back to Gerrit patch set. Also, there is a cron job which executes all the daily tests for 7-8 hours.

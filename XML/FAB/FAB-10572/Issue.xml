CDATA The LSCC is currently the only system chaincode where some of the ACL resource names and the function names do not line up. This makes it difficult to test these resources and policies in a consistent way with the other system chaincodes.Â   For example, the resource: * lscc/ChaincodeExists is used for lscc's getid function * lscc/GetChaincodeData is used for lscc's getccdata function * lscc/GetDeploymentSpec is used for lscc's getdepspec function  All other resources and functions follow the pattern <system-chaincode-name>/<function-name>  Allowing use of an alias (i.e. support the previous function name while also accepting the part of the resource name after the system chaincode name) would resolve this.  ></description> </Issue>

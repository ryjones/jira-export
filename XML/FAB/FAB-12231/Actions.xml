CDATA I have mixed feelings on including javaenv as part of the default download, as it is not strictly required. I would expect majority of people would still use go chaincode or node chaincode, and for the people that want javaenv, it will either pull automatically at instantiate time or they could pull manually.  What do you think  ~mastersingh24   ~ChristopherFerris  ?    I believe  ~sstone1  raised the request...  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  I'll add my 2c - if your first experience of Fabric as a Java developer is to get a timeout during instantiate whilst it pulls quite a large Java chaincode image from Docker Hub - that's a pretty bad experience when compared to waiting a bit longer for the download of all the images at Fabric "install" time.   "I would expect majority of people would still use go chaincode or node chaincode"  I'm not sure I agree with this statement either - we will _potentially_ be opening up Fabric to the massive Java developer community, which could see a lot of people come and try Fabric for the first time, and then get disappointed as per the above.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sstone1   Ok, if we are seeing timeout at instantiate time, I agree we should pull javaenv in advance via bootstrap script. +2ed.  ></body> </Action>

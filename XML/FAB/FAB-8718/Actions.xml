However, the client has to be aware of the collection configurations which is more of a indirect dependency of a client on the discovery feature." created="2018-04-23 19:54:19.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2018-04-23 19:54:19.0"/>

CDATA  ~Clayton Sims   ~manish-sethi  There is actually one small direct SDK impact.  Upon chaincode instantiation client will need to pass collection config as an additional instantiation parameter.  I've given  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com  and  ~rickr  a heads up and created sub-items FAB-9679 and FAB-9680 for them.  Also SDKs will need to ensure that subdirectories under META-INF/statedb/couchdb can be passed, for couchdb index definitions per FAB-7779.  ></body> </Action>

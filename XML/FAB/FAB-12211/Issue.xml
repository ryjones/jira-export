CDATA The 'bootstrap' script (iscripts/bootstrap.sh) s called from numerous builds and it is lacking proper error handling. Proper error handling is necessary for any batch script used by Jenkins builds.  The command line parsing is pretty add-hoc. I will be defining  the command line arguments within this Ticket and once I have buy-in from a yet to be determined list.  Once buy-in is achieved I will implement, test & deploy     ></description> </Issue>

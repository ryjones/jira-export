CDATA * As a Fabric deployer, I would like to maintain data such that only its evidence is exposed to the chain, ordering service, and channel peers while the data itself is disseminated to peers based on policy, so that we can achieve finer-grained data confidentiality for transactions while still maintaining ledger consistency and still being able to leverage Fabric for both data evidence and dissemination of the data (but in a more private fashion).  *Design*Â   Slides attached.  ></description> </Issue>

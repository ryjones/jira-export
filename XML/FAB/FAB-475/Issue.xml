<Issue id="12776" key="FAB-475" number="475" project="10002" reporter="corecode" creator="corecode" type="10001" summary="generic check for correct requests" description="The consensus network should not add garbage data to the batches it produces.  Especially under byzantine assumptions, it is possible that byzantine nodes (client, primary) introduce invalid data into the batches.  To protect against this, requests proposed by a leader need to be validated for a correct signature from an authorized client.  This way a leader (or unauthorized client) can not add invalid requests.  This can be implemented as a generic component that can be shared by different consensus implementations.  In the case of bft, replicas check the batch preprepared by the primary and perform a view change when requests are invalid.  This component would be used by FAB-474 to filter requests before they get added to the fresh pool." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2016-09-27 12:23:06.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:54:38.0" resolutiondate="2016-12-07 21:21:53.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="36284"/>

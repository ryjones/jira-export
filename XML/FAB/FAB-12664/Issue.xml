The reason for that is probably that the network is returning the interface types instead of the concrete implementations and would require type assertions for exit processing." priority="4" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-10-31 13:38:33.0" updated="2018-11-09 14:50:18.0" resolutiondate="2018-11-09 14:50:18.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="46431"/>

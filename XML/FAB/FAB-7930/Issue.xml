CDATA In the feature-upgrade behave tests, there are multiple steps that are used to perform certain actions. It would be nice to be able to write tests such that these steps can be consolidated into a single step. For example, when a user wants to invoke on a specific channel with a specific set of args, we should be able to write this in 1 step.   Behave allows for the consolidation of steps. For example,  {code} @when('I do the same thing as before') def step_impl(context): context.execute_steps(''' When I press the big red button And I duck '''){code}  ></description> </Issue>

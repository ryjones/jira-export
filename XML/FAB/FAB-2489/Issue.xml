CDATA They layout of the `orderer` package doesn't quite make sense anymore. For instance, "kafka", "sbft", and "solo" should not be on the same level as "multichain" - they serve different purposes. There are also SBFT-related files on the top level dir that really need to go (network_test.go, sbft_test.go).  Packages and files need to be renamed and re-arranged, so as to be more expressive and convey the relationship between the modules.  We will use this issue to document how we want the new structure to look like. Once we have reached agreement on the new layout, I'll push the respective changeset.  ></description> </Issue>

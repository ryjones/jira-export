CDATA The version of Kafka that Hyperledger Fabric uses is dependent on Zookeeper version 3.4.9, which has the following security vulnerability:  https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-8012/.|https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-8012/   If we run Fabric, especially within enterprises, we may get flagged by periodic security scanners.  To limit our scope to NL, we can mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by preventing exposure of Zookeeper service ports (in the containers) to external machines, and instead just expose them to the Kafka containers. This will not impact functionality, and will prevent the service from getting flagged as vulnerable.  ></description> </Issue>

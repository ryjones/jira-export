CDATA Refer to Item 34 of tab "Behave Testcases" of  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741 .  Use idemix in interop tests using fabric+ca+node-sdk and fabric+ca+java-sdk. (Consider incorporating idemix user and admin into the interop tests defined in FAB-15967.) This will allow replacing the behave interop test in fabric-test/feature/fabric-ca.feature: {quote}Scenario Outline: FAB-11728: Identity Mixer Test Happy Path {quote} Note: Angelo's pending CR for FAB-13231 adds to fabric integration nwo a test using idemix for a query with User1 using idemixOrg "Org3", based on nwo which generates crypto (but does not use CA, so is not interop test).  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/q/status:open+idemix   Note: The java-sdk has integration tests with Fabric and CA, but no idemix. The java-sdk supports idemix, but the node-sdk does not (as of Oct 2019). The node-sdk has integrations tests with Fabric and generates its own crypto. We plan to add idemix to the end2end integration test in java-sdk, and include it in interop tests (refer toÂ FAB-15967).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Ability to read a restricted subset of the local peer configuration from a user chaincode.  *+Motivation+*  In the context of the use case described by FAB-2440, the user CC processing the client request is invoked on the channel specified by the client. Typically, it's a channel that is shared among multiple Organizations - potential service providers. To determine whether or not it can fulfill the request, the user CC queries the Organization's local sub-ledger. As the chains must have unique names within a network, local sub-ledgers belonging to different Organizations must have different names. In order to perform a query on the Organization's local sub-ledger, a user CC needs to know the sub-ledger name. The local sub-ledger name could be stored in the local peer as a configuration parameter which name has been agreed upon among the Organizations (service providers) for that type of service. User CC is able to access the local peer's configuration parameters via the Peer Configuration Reader System Chaincode (PCRSCC).  *+Configuration Access Restrictions+*  PCRSCC must allow a deployer to limit user CC's access to the local peer's configuration to a specific subset of the peer's configuration parameters.  ></description> </Issue>

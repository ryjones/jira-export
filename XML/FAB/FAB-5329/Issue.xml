CDATA First step I did is install and instantiated chaincode ID _{{marblesRC1}}_. notice the *uppercase* _RC_. * worked just fine no errors * looking at the chaincode's container name: _ truncated -fabric-peer-org1-28882c0-marblesrc1-v4_ **  it does *NOT* contain any uppercase characters * I ran marbles on this chaincode. The SDK apis was fed _{{marblesRC1.}}_ {{notice the }}*uppercase* letters and worked just fine reaching the lowercase docker container. * APIs such as list install chaincode have the case preserved as _{{marblesRC1}}_ * Everything seems happy so far  Second step I did is install and instantiate chaincode _{{marblesrc1}}_. notice the *lowercase* _rc_. * worked just fine no errors (this is surprising) * looking for the chaincode's docker container I found that there are *no* new containers! it reused the same container.... *this is bad* ** I confirmed its the same container by looking at the status up time. It had been reset since the 1st instantiate     Whatever code is running to see if a chaincode ID is already in use is currently case sensitive.  This is a problem since something (maybe docker?) is translating them to lowercase.    * I'm using fabric v1 RC1 via the bluemix service. * Install/instantiate were done using the SDK v1.0.0-rc1     Also note that instantiate will fail if I try the exact ID twice, as expected.  ex: instantiate *marblestest* twice will fail on the 2nd attempt. (this is good)              ></description> </Issue>

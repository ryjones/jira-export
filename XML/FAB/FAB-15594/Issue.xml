CDATA See    https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15543?focusedCommentId=60368&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-60368  and responses for more information.  Now that RejectAllPolicy will be used when an invalid collection config is encountered, the private data won't be persisted but user transaction will be validated. We expect that since private data won't be persisted that users will see this issue prior to moving the bad collection config to production environments. And with the new endorser fixes we don't expect a transaction with bad collection config to get all the way to validation phase in the first place.  ></description> </Issue>

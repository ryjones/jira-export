Where is it described? {quote}  Well that's just my opinion. TLS doesn't add any overhead (AES GCM has hardware support on modern CPUs) so I don't see why not always use it.   What about peers? Do you also disable TLS on peers?   Setting that aside, it should be pretty straight forward to fix, do you want to push a change?   ></body> </Action>

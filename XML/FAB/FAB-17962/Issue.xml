CDATA I set up a BYFN and tried to call the QSCC command using the command line.  peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n qscc -c '\{"Args": "GetChainInfo","mychannel" }'  I found that the result returned was messy code.  !image-2020-06-08-10-07-47-959.png!  I then called several other QSCC commands  (include GetBlockByNum, GetBlockByHash) and found the same problem, but the node log does not report any errors, everything is fine, and the status code returned is also 200  Is there something wrong, or is it just the way it was designed  ></description> </Issue>

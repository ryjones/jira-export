CDATA My initial thoughts on this issue are as follows.  func AddAnchorPeer(baseConfig *cb.Config, orgName string, anchor *AnchorPeer) (*cb.Config, error) { ...... } In the implementation of this function, there are three main situations that need to be considered. 1. if the baseConfig(channel_group.Groups Application .groups  ) does not have the orgName, return error 2. if the org already has anchors, then append the anchor to the array of anchor_peers and add the version. In this case, we should confirm whether the anchor to be added is already in the list 3. if the org does not have any anchor info, we should init the AnchorPeers struct with anchor. Then set version to be 0 and the mod_policy is the same as MSP's mod_policy  ></body> </Action>

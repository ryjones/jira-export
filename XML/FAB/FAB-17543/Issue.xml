CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to use a fit-for-purpose library that can modify an existing channel configuration to add an anchor peer.  Acceptance: Starting with an existing Config block/transaction, I can call a function that adds an anchor peer to the configuration. After performing that operation, I can compute a ConfigUpdate transaction that is ready for a signature workflow.  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/channel_update_tutorial.html#updating-the-channel-config-to-include-an-org3-anchor-peer-optional  ></description> </Issue>

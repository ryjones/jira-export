CDATA *Acceptance*: A simulated client creates an issue token transaction. Commit function is invoked on the committing peer, and is routed through the custom transaction processor dedicated to token transactions. Ledger should be updated according to the transaction content. If the transaction violates the issuer rules (issuing policy compliance) the transaction should be rejected and have no impact on the ledger. If the transaction is well formed and the creator complies with the token system's issuing policy, the transaction should be validated and its write set added/committed to the ledger.      *How:* This refers to the registration of a custom tx processor for tokens into the peer customTxProcessors variable.  ></description> </Issue>

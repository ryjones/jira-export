CDATA Currently CC install API just returns SUCCESS with an the text String "OK" as bytes. None of the current SDK I know actually looks at that string/byte.  They just validate it's SUCCESS.     The API should be be change add a byte encode protobuf.  This is more flexible and can be add to in the future.     For v1.1 it should have   message CCInstallResponse \{    string ID = 1;   // The ID aka hash for the CC. }     old peer response could be check if it's just "OK" and release this needs to be ignored as the peer probably does not support the new CC life cycle.  ></description> </Issue>

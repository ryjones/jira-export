CDATA In this item, we aim to enhance the processing capability of committing peers in token transactions with accommodating Approve token transactions.  Here the owner of a set of coins can essentially delegate the use of a few of its tokens to one or more other users. Committing peers should ensure that the tokens to be delegated have not been spent so far, and that the transaction creator is indeed their owner. Last but not least, the committing peer would update the state of the ledger to consider the new owners for the tokens to be delegated.  ></description> </Issue>

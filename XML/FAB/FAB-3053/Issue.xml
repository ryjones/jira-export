CDATA The v0.6 docs included release notes. This seems to have been removed in the transition to v1.0 docs.   The docs should link to the complete release history and release notes. See cloud foundry  1  or kubernetes  2  for example. Note that both projects provide links to their release history and release notes from the documentation for each release.   1  https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases  2  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases  ></description> </Issue>

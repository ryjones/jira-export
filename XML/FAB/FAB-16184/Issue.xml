CDATA We added {{set -e -o pipefail}} to {{run-unit-tests.sh}} and it did what it was supposed to do. When the grep buried in {{packages_diff}} exited with a non-zero RC, the pipe failed.  Once that's fixed, we have an issue where the result of that function is a new line separated list of packages. Now that we treat packages and args as arrays, the entire list became a single argument to {{go list}} and that broke other things.  <sigh/>  ></description> </Issue>

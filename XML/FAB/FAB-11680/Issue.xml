CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client constructs a request to construct an redemption proof by  providing the identifier of tokens to be introduced into the system, and invokes  the peer API. The peer would need to construct the corresponding redemption proof and return it to the (simulated) client. Acceptance would require that the constructed proof matches the input parameters of the request.  ></description> </Issue>

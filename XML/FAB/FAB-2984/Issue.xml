However, some docker-compositions have started using it to drive the &quot;peer chaincode&quot; type CLI commands.  This is not advised, as the environment is too stripped down to support things like chaincode development.  This will break as we move forward with tighter integration with chaincode development." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-04-04 13:40:16.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:12:07.0" resolutiondate="2017-05-26 18:13:32.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="37903"/>

CDATA FAB-6868 adds a utility method that extracts the TLS cert hash from the channel header of an envelope, and then compares it to the TLS cert hash of a gRPC context.  Since we need to do that for the events (which don't use the same envelopes), it makes no sense to implement this again for a new protobuf message type.  What we should ideally have is that utility to accept a function that extracts the TLS cert hash from the protobuf message, and then it can be reused for all our protocol messages.  ></description> </Issue>

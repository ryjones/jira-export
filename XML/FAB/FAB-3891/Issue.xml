CDATA prepare for the alpha2 release process. -This will involve creating the "release" branch as per the process proposal proposed by Dave at the Hackfest.-Â   -Suggest that we leave master as master and actually create a "develop" branch after we tag the v1.0.0-alpha2 release on the master branch, and that we then shift the target of all CRs to the "develop" branch from that point forward. Master will only merge FF merges from a temporary release branch created from "develop" which will run through the gauntlet of tests before being merged to "master" and cutting a release.-  -Note that this will also require that all in-flight CRs be resubmitted against the "develop" branch.-  just tag and publish release without changing branch structure for now.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It is desirable to have a single easy way to deploy a network. All external users and many internal users could benefit from cello, instead of maintaining their own startup scripts which require an ongoing cost to maintain as fabric evolves. Cello is recommended by fabric team as the supported way to spin up a network. If the Cello team incorporates fabric changes to certs, directories, setup sequences, etc, then many other teams would not have to duplicate their efforts. By incorporating cello within automated tests run daily, it will support cello team by proving in their work, and will enable other teams to focus on their application work. And it would be a huge benefit to external user community, who is currently struggling with setting up networks.  Set up a submodule for cello inside fabric-test repo.  Define default network configuraiton yaml file and provide Readme file explanation how to use it, including how to choose singlehost or multihost, and and how to set config variables defined in core.yaml and configtx.yaml etc.  And revise automated tests as needed to use this cello-initiated network for: * e2e tests and other CI tests in daily test suite * behave tests * performance system tests * other integration tests and peer tests from the v1.0 SVT which require a full network  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, you must transfer exact same quantity as the quantity in token ids. This causes usability issue because client will have to subtract to get the remaining quantity and include it in the transfer share.  Update transactor.go to automatically calculate the remaining quantity and include it in the token transaction.      ></description> </Issue>

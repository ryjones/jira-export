CDATA In release-1.4 test, behave is not pulling fabric-ca-peer and fabric-ca-orderer images as these images are not available in dockerhub or nexus. As these images or binaries are not available in the test environment, the above is test is failing while trying to use fabric-ca-client binary.  I suggest to disable these tests if possible, as these images are not available in release-1.4 release.  ></body> </Action>

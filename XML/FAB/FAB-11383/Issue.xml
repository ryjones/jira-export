CDATA h2. What?  Perhaps this will be a non-issue when the CLI is eventually redesigned, but as things stand, there are certain operations that leave the user hanging as to whether their invocation was successful or not.  As an example, at the INFO log level, this is the only output a Fabric CLI user sees when they instantiate a chaincode: {noformat} 2018-07-28 13:43:44.929 UTC  chaincodeCmd  checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 001 Using default escc 2018-07-28 13:43:44.929 UTC  chaincodeCmd  checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 002 Using default vscc {noformat} Or consider the case where they wish to sign a transaction (using peer channl signconfigtx): {noformat} 2018-07-28 14:06:22.880 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized {noformat} There is no information in either of these cases to let the users know whether the operation succeeded or not. h2. How to fix this?  Add a log level message (INFO for success, ERROR for error) that prints the status of the operation.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The purpose for this is to allow in docker-compose files the ability to just reference the latest fabaric/ca images regardless of their release tags.  Each time a release in a major version is published to docker hub with tags like:  x86_64-1.1.0-alpha, x86_64-1.1.0-rc and later x86_64-1.1.0, and then x86_64-1.1.1  There should be a x86_64-1.1-LATEST image tag alias that is update to reference that same image above.     This would allow for SDKs, tests user created in docker-compose files to just get the latest when they're published. by specifying something like this:  orderer.example.com:     container_name: orderer.example.com     image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:x86_64-1.1-LATEST     Discussed with  ~mastersingh24         ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~C0rWin  by the same token wouldn't you want to remove StartServer too ? These are left-overs from 0.6.   If we remove these, then we can implement the rest (status and log levels) in system chaincodes and can do away with this service altogether.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We either need to remove these or add security around them.   Personally, I think we need a new set of administrative functions moving forward so my vote is to actually remove the adminserver altogether  FYI - this is a security issue  ></body> </Action>

CDATA related https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-820  Unfortunately we didn't get to it, so I agreed that we should remove the entire admin service, not just `peer node stop` because any of them is unsecured.   ></body> </Action>

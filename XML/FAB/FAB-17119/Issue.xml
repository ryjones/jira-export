CDATA After release step in chaincode installation, contents of release dir are moved to durable path via rename. However, this would not work if oldpath and newpath are not on the same mounted filesystem, which sometimes is true in container, since build is done in tmpdir and durable path is always on persistent volume.  we should attempt to copy if move fails.  ></description> </Issue>

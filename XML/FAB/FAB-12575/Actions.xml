CDATA It would help if you define a concrete use case we can talk to.  When you say endorsement for a smart contract transaction in your discussion I assume you are looking to "read" additional data from another smart contract or other data source to approve the transaction proposal ( and NOT update any other data except what that first smart contract can )?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Let us frist try to get agreement on the first suggestion of Jim, to add a concrete case.  We only have to demonstrate that two different functions in one and the same smart contract may need two different set of endorsing parties. Look at fabcar.  Think of the function transferOwnership where the endorsement is needed from the current owner and the new owner according to the commercial laws in most democracies.  However when the car is stolen, there is a need of an endorsement of the current owner and the police (in the jurisdiction The Netherlands) and with that available the Insurance Company will pay.  Hence there may be two functions in the car Smart Contract, transferOwnership and getProofof Theft for the Insurance company. I hope this is sufficient. In case all endorsements for all functions of a smart contract are the same, the endorsement can be specified at the smart contract level.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Is this request specifically to support "granular endorsement levels" ?? ( eg channel, contract, function or state ??)  I agree with the fabcar example above - endorsement on car.changeOwner requires 2 participants. endorsement on car.stolen requires 2 different participants for endorsement.  Here's an architecture working group paper on Interoperability that breaks down details on consensus. It has some useful input concepts that may apply here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bwxgnJ-mOQ6Vp_eCo0vXhLF3uMzhJ6dV8ZxiVbTZYA/edit#heading=h.u2cdf1y0og9x        ></body> </Action>

CDATA This JIRA is primarily to introduce a conceptual structure that makes a production grade Fabric easier to achieve. Most Enterprise applications have a scope of tens, hundreds and sometimes thousands of the equivalent of relational tables. This means that we need a modular approach to update programs that _*together*_ form the scope of the ledger, and not any longer restricted to the one and only smart contract in the channel. Hence the set-theoretic union of all the update data structures of all the smart contracts associated with a channel determine the scope of the ledger.  Function based endorsement is not something I have invented, you can read it in nearly every larger regulation and thus we need that in a blockchain system that needs to support the associated regulation based services. Once you have that available, you have the hierarchy channel, smart contract, function as an endorsment policy option and associated precedence rules. This is one dimension for the endorsement policies. State based endorsement is in a different dimension. I am happy that you agree with the example of car functions and associated different endorsements per function as this is still not accepted by some Fabric decision makers.  I will study the paper you suggested and come back after the study. Thanks for the reference.  ></body> </Action>

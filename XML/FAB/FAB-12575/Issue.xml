In such a system a smart contract will only have update functions in a relative small subset of the channel. Hence the proposal is that the set-theoretic union of all (update) smart contracts determine the data structure of the channel ledger. However a smart contract can see (of course if it has the required permission) the data of other channels but can&apos;t update the ledger of the other channels. With that structure in place it is possible to have channel based endorsement, smart contract based endorsement and function based endorsement, with the following precedence rules: a function based endorsement overrules the smart contract and channel based endorsement, and a smart contract based endorsement has precedence over the channel based endorsement. This endorsement can then support the roles defined in regulations and this is imo what is needed in production grade manageable systems.

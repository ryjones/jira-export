CDATA The said  interface|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/gossip/gossip/gossip.go  has some methods used by the component itself, but not by all the component, such as  methods used by private data|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/db088625774d47aceb499eb0301c67be0e5a45c6/gossip/privdata/distributor.go#L35-L49 , and other methods used by external components to gossip such as  discovery.|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/eca1b14b7e3453a5d32296af79cc7bad10c7673b/discovery/endorsement/endorsement.go#L47-L57 .  There is no reason to have an interface in the first place, and we can just have the  gossip constructor|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go#L71  return an exported struct instead of the gossip.Gossip interface, and then we can perhaps remove the interface altogether.   ></description> </Issue>

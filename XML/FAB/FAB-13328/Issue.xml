<Issue id="36242" key="FAB-13328" number="13328" project="10002" reporter="senthil1" assignee="senthil1" creator="senthil1" type="10003" summary="make only one function to use the committedDataCache at a time" description="Among ValidateAndPrepare(), PrepareExpiringKeys(), and RemoveStaleAndCommitPvtDataOfOldBlocks(), we can allow only one function to execute at a time. The reason is that each function calls LoadCommittedVersions() which would clear the existing entries in the transient buffer and load new entries (such a transient buffer is not applicable for the golevelDB). As a result, these three functions can interleave and nullify the optimization provided by the bulk read API. Once the ledger cache (FAB-103) is introduced and existing LoadCommittedVersions() is refactored to return a map, we can allow these three functions to execute parallely.Â " priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-12-18 11:56:12.0" updated="2020-06-11 15:31:04.0" resolutiondate="2018-12-19 03:33:10.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="47761"/>

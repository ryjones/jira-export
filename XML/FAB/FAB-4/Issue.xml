CDATA  rseeger  12:54 PM    Hello -- I have a peer discovery issue. The peers are reporting their internal Docker IPs (172.x.x.x) instead of their external IP addresses, so other peers are unable to connect e.g. here's the info a peer received about peer ID HL2:  ```16:49:55.556  peer  beforePeers -> DEBU 2b4f9 Received PeersMessage with Peers: peers:<ID:<name:"HL2" > address:"172.17.0.28:7051" type:VALIDATOR > peers:<ID:<name:"Cisco-hl3" > address:"172.17.0.2:7051" type:VALIDATOR >```  Anyone familiar with this particular issue?  rseeger  1:04 PM    i.e.  Peer1 starts up. Peer2 starts up pointing to Peer1's CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_ROOTNODE external IP. Peer2 says "Hi, in case anyone asks, my IP is 172.17.41.1" (wrong). Peer3 starts up also pointing to Peer1's CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_ROOTNODE external IP and asks for peers. Peer1 says it knows about Peer2 at 172.17.41.1. Peer3 tries to connect to Peer2 at that IP, but times out because that's an internal docker IP on a different machine. (edited)  ></description> </Issue>

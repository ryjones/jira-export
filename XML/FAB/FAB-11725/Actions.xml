CDATA I created another testtask to add some functional tests into Behave framework, to use node SDK with our cc2cc tests. That is desirable if those test usecases are not covered by existing node-sdk Integration tests. However, FAB-13004 has limitations: our Behave framework does not support service discovery; and, those tests execute only a few transactions but do not run traffic.   To write and run this test, the PTE must be enhanced to run tests with chaincodes calling other chaincodes (cc2cc, per FAB-11716).  Note PTE already supports service discovery - although I am not sure if it needs enhancements. Some work is being done in node sdk in v1.4;  are there any new API being added in the node-sdk for service discovery to work with cc2cc?  The node-sdk in v1.4 is expected to deliver a new algorithm for the service discovery traffic to be distributed randomly (instead of always choosing the first layout discovered). Since that should be available as the new default, other regression tests would test that new algorithm code.  This test would send traffic, using service discovery, for cc2cc code. Being a user-oriented test (focusing on the behavior of chaincodes), it is considered to be lower in priority and thus gated as "future" instead of v1.4.  ></body> </Action>

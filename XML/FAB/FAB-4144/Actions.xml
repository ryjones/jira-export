CDATA  ~mastersingh24   ~muralisr   ~binhn  I don't think  ~rickr  was asking for multiple versions to be supported at one time, his main concerns is if a client app got out of sync with chaincode, peer should have a clearer indication of such a situation. And the most straightforward way is for the client to specify what it believes is the latest version, and have the peer give an error like "this version is not the currently active one any longer" if the client sent the wrong version.  The peer already has all the information to make such a judgement, and the protobuf definite is already in place (currently the version field in ChaincodeInvocationSpec is just ignored during invocation).  I don't feel strongly about this one. And agree it's more of an enhancement. But want to clarify the intention.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, since the general trend had been towards improving documentation to explain what the system does, rather than make functional changes at this stage, suggest we do just that and turn this over to the documentation team.  Someone with domain knowledge should provide the scaffolding of the docs for cleanup by Anthony and team.  Removed review-needed and changed the component. If someone wants to add a JIRA to make a functional change post 1.0 that is also fine.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Peer CLI performs  1. Creating Channel 2. Peer Joins the Channel 3. Install Chaincode 4. Instantiate Chaincode  The 4th command processing fails. This happens on one of the setup and is been shown to  ~bmos299 . And discussed with  ~binhn  *Setup* Current setup uses 2-Organization setup and 2-Peers per Organization, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/tree/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/e2e-2Orgs.  1. we are using scripts from ` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/e2e_cli ` 2. we are currently using already created channel configuration block, orderer genesis block and certification related data from ` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/tree/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/e2e-2Orgs   Peer CLI is currently used by our environment for bootstrapping channels and also adding business reference data.    Peer Logs are attached soon after the instantiation fails  {quote} Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = 2 desc = Transaction returned with failure: Failed extracting proposal fields.

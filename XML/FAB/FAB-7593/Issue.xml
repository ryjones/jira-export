CDATA The current approach to private data leaks information about who’s doing business with whom. Collection configuration (--FAB-6212--) is stored on the ledger (detailing which groups of entities are planning to conduct private business together). Furthermore, every private write reveals the collection name, and hence, the set of organizations that are party to that transaction.  This item supports stronger confidentiality properties by shifting the private data dissemination responsibility to the client. A client would choose which organization's peers should receive the private data, without having to leak the collection membership in the transaction's read/write set.  ></description> </Issue>

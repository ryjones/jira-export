CDATA Currently the only way to create and modify channels is via protobufs.  This is complex and error prone.  The SDK needs to simplify this for users.  Suggested implementation is for the SDK to take a json object describing the channel to be created, list of members, etc and create the channel.    ></description> </Issue>

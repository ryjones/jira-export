CDATA A series of work consolidating protos has been submitted to fabric # https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2081/ - first version of new fabric/protos # https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2075/ - creation of higher level proto structures such as Envelope  # https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2337/ - consolidation of protos from orderer into fabric/protos/orderer and the creation of a common protos into fabric/protos/common  As the next step * we need to move remained of protos (endorser specific) into fabric/protos/peer * cleanup unwanted protos  The final step would be to get rid of old Transaction and Block type so we don't need Transaction2 and Block2. This will be done in a future task as they involve deeper cleanup in chaincode and ledger respectively.   We likely don't need the old Message at all. That may be one "cleanup" we could do as part of this task.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The peer panics when performing an invoke on the init function after a chaincode redefinition has taken place. While the invoke is not necessary unless the chaincode has actually changed, the panic should not take place. There should be an error message instead that states something along the lines of "init has already been completed'.  Logs have been attached (panic appears in peer0.org3.example.com log).  ></description> </Issue>

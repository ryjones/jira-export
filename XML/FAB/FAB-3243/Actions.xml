CDATA Changed type to "New Feature"   ~liuwenliang0632  - Thanks for creating this feature requirement.  It definitely seems like it would be very useful for people.  I changed this to "New Feature" as this is adding additonal APIs beyond the initial scope of the currently defined API set.  I set the target to "Future" as the core is currently locked down for bugs fixes and stabilization at this point  ></body> </Action>

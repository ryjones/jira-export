CDATA *Acceptance*: A fabric client can be built to submit a “transfer” request to a peer. The peer validates the request and checks that the request's creator has the rights to submit that request. If this is case, the TokenManagerSystem bound to the channel specified in the request is used to generate a RequestTransfer object which is then embedded in a TokenTransaction message. This message is returned back to the client via response.  *Remarks:* access control can be performed in multiple way. Example are: # request's creator is a writer of the channel the request targets; # request's creator is a writer of the channel the request targets AND the creator is in the contacted peer's organisation;   ></description> </Issue>

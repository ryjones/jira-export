Since these sample configuration files get shipped in our images, when customers forget to override the MSP ID, they get error messages complaining about how the &apos;DEFAULT&apos; MSP id is not valid.  This is very confusing, because users assume the defaults are valid.  This would be much more clear, and be a much more obvious that it should be changed if it were renamed to &quot;SampleOrg&quot; to reflect that it is part of the sample configuration and not a valid default." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-03-30 15:39:03.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:16:11.0" resolutiondate="2018-04-01 12:47:14.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="41709"/>

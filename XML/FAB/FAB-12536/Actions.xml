CDATA  ~jonathan-blood  From your description you make it sound like the transient field is coming back from peer.  I looked at the node sdk code and that is an incorrect assumption. You are printing: {code:java} console.log(results 1 .payload.toString('utf8'));{code} In the response from sendTransactionProposal(request) , results 0  will be the response from the peer, results 1  is a copy of the proposal that the client submitted to chaincode.  So in your log you are simply seeing the transient field that got submitted to peer for chaincode execution.  The transient field will eventually get stripped out when submitting to orderer via sendTransaction().  This line calls buildEnvelope() and passes the results 1  aka chaincodeProposal:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.3/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L2834   Then the transient field is stripped out before creating the final chaincodeProposalPayload that will be submitted to ordering:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.3/fabric-client/lib/Channel.js#L3073-L3081   This will then match the hash of the proposal that the peer returned in ProposalResponse, since the peer similarly stripped out transient field when generating the hash, as seen here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/protos/utils/txutils.go#L376-L378   So it looks like everything is working as expected.  I will close the issue.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA We've cleaned up the apis for listening for events in the 2.0.0-beta.4 release of fabric-network, which will be available in a 2.x release some time soon.  There's no example in fabric-samples of a smart contract emitting an event in a transaction and an application listening for it, and pulling out useful information from a block/transaction/contract event. This would provide a good example to point users at and display best practices for listening for events.   I'm unclear whether this should be a specific event-type sample, or whether we should update the current samples, or perhaps just update one transaction in fabcar/commercial paper to do this.  Should also be considered for java, and go, once the programming model work has been delivered into the go-sdk  ></description> </Issue>

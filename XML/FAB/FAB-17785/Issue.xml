CDATA As a member of the hyperledger community, I would like to see a demo/sample configtx CLI that utilizes the configtx package so that I have a better idea of how to consume the library. This CLI may end up being a community tool as well that replaces configtxgen for general config transaction generation.  Â   *Acceptance*  **A simple CLI exists for the configtx library that has commands and flags for generating system channel genesis blocks, application create channel transactions, and config updates supporting all updatable config properties via flags or subcommands.  Example: {code:java} configtx update addAnchorPeer --config ./current_config.pb --org Org1 --anchorPeer newhost:123 --output ./config_update.pb{code} The above command (or something similar to it) should produce a config update transaction adding anchor peer newhost:123 to Org1.  The CLI should be well documented for use cases in the help/manual.  ></description> </Issue>

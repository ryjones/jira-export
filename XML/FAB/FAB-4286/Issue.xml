CDATA Define peer partitions using a configuration transaction via special type of “policies”. Peer partition creation should specify in terms of policies the set of peers/organisations that are included in the partition. # would partitions be defined in an identity channel? It may be easier if partitions are to be used cross-channels, and their definition/update via configuration blocks/txs # who would be authorised to update the partition # is the partition a chaincode refers to anonymous? Should it not be anonymous? # do we want to consider the option of having partitions be defined/configured via a system chaincode? May be easier to leverage sideDB features there...      ></description> </Issue>

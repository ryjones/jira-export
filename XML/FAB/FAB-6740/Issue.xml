CDATA The GRPCServer.SetClientRootCAs() function currently eliminates duplicate root certificates by using a map with a key based on the RawSubject.   While it should not be the case that we should end up with duplicate subjects nor should it be the case that the root certificate for an org should differ across channels, it is possible for this to happen.  So we need a better way to uniquely key root certificates.    SubjectKeyIdentifier should be unique across root certificates.  It's not a mandatory field so we'll need to maintain two maps but if SKI exists we won't add it to the RawSubject map.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~nickgaski  as you know, we have FAB-4073 in progress which provides a tutorial for building a network. We also have FAB-4851 which doesn't yet have any associated documentation, but for purposes of a developer (such as for Writing your first app) can get someone running with just the very basic config to do development/testing.  Given all that, can this be closed as DUPLICATE?  ></body> </Action>

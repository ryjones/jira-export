CDATA We need to keep our simple bootstrap script as most app developers won't care about the mechanics of building and bootstrapping a network.  However, for first time users we should bring each component up one by one and explain its purpose, prerequisites, etc...  We will have a running diagram showing all the pieces being added.  In the end the reader is left with a fabric network and a channel, on which they can run chaincode and write transactions to the ledger.   Rather than turning this piece into a dissertation on all things fabric, we will link off to key concepts and deeper dives.   ></description> </Issue>

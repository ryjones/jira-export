CDATA Closing the tickets since:  1. If there is an error on FS level, the commit will fail eventually leading peer to panic and exit.  2. It's very unlikely to get into situation where write will hangs on indefinitely, hence per discussion with @yacovm we should not try to over complicate code providing solution for this case.  ></environment> <description><! CDATA In some cases, the delivery service pulls blocks while the ledger may be stuck, i.e if the file system is full.     There is no point in doing so, and we need to: * Make the delivery service stop pulling blocks * Perhaps also disable the leader election module for that channel until the peer's ledger recovers.      ~C0rWin   ~gennadyl   opinions?  ></description> </Issue>

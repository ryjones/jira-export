CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to use a signing identity to create config update signatures. Currently when opening the GoDoc the first function we see is CreateSignedConfigUpdateEnvelope, which is quite a wordy first impression. Let's consider renaming this to just SignConfigUpdateEnvelope (not to be confused with the existing SignConfigUpdate) and extend the SigningIdentity to potentially encapsulate both SignConfigUpdate and SignConfigUpdateEnvelope. The GoDoc documentation should explain the usage and differences between the two.      *Acceptance*  SigningIdentity should be extended with SignConfigUpdate at the minimum. Consider also extending with  the renamed SignConfigUpdateEnvelope if deemed necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

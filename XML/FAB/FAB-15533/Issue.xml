CDATA In order to create in-proc Orderer clients, as required by FAB-15532, we need properly signed envelopes. However, if we load msp within test proc, we are constraint by that specific msp throughout the whole test, due to the singleton nature of MSP, see FAB-6559.  We could add a command {{sign}} to {{peer}}, which simply signs a given tx file in place, similar to {{signconfigtx}}. So that in-proc clients would create tx file, invoke {{peer sign}} in a separate proc to sign it.  ></description> </Issue>

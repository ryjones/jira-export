If you want to do this, pls feel free to grab it back.  Anil, I think the only thing needed here is to make the binaries dependent upon the source files, so a change to the source files triggers a rebuild of the binaries which should then trigger a rebuild of the docker image.  You can reproduce the problem as follows:  # make fabric-ca-server to build the executable # touch cmd/fabric-ca-server/main.go # make fabric-ca-server will say it is up-to-date, but it should rebuild   ></body> </Action>

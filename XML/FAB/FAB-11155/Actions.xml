<Action id="48033" issue="31889" author="sanchezl" type="comment" body="I would suggest that this issue is changed to ask that fabric simply leave the members section intact and only update the admins section when updating the security object. A user would then be free to update the members section of the security object without fabric clobbering it.

CDATA  ~ashutosh_kumar  FAB-1308 will add validation function which should prevent any write operation by any other user than server admin user used by peer. This is how we will provision read only user.   ~sanchezl  since v1.2 add database _security object, I agree the peer should not revert any changes done through external provisioning. Can you confirm.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rhegde  the peer currently WILL overwrite the {{_security}} object. As mentioned in my previous comment, I think the best you can ask for is that future versions do not clobber the {{members}} property of the {{_security}} object, the peer will need to maintain control over the {{admins}} property.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a specific consortium does not have policies, and the Consortiums group or a specific org has a hardcoded policy, retrieving the policies is meaningless. Therefore, the function GetPoliciesForConsortium, GetPoliciesForConsortiums, and GetPoliciesForConsortiumOrg can be removed.  Is my understanding wrong? If it is correct, I can fix this issue.   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="68662" issue="44665" author="caod" type="comment" body="The first two functions can be removed for the reasons you mentioned. GetPoliciesForConsortiumOrg probably still should exist since policies are added to the consortium org. There is a consideration that maybe we should still support retrieving the consortium hardcoded policy since maybe in the future we might support updating it, but for now it&apos;s probably unnecessary and can be removed." created="2020-03-30 14:13:32.0" updateauthor="caod" updated="2020-03-30 14:14:22.0"/>

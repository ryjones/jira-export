We should go ahead and remove any functions around retrieving policies from a consortium. Likewise the consortiums group also does not support adding/removing policies and only contains a single hardcoded AcceptAll signature policy. It&apos;s probably ok to support retrieving the policy for consortiums group since that doesn&apos;t hurt, but it would always be the same hardcoded value so maybe consider just removing it. Luckily we didn&apos;t add any functions for adding/removing policies from a consortium or consortiums group so we don&apos;t need to do anything there." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-03-26 14:40:23.0" updated="2020-04-03 15:05:52.0" resolutiondate="2020-04-03 15:05:52.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="58583" archived="N"/>

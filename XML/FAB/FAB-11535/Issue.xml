CDATA With the implementation of the peer chaincode package, peer chaincode install, and peer chaincode list for the new lifecycle, it should be possible to test these using the e2e framework.  There is likely no need to create an entire new suite for this with a new network, but extending an existing suite should be straightforward.  The test should package a chaincode, install that package, and verify that the package is returned as installed.  ></description> </Issue>

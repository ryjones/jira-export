CDATA I'm trying to drive the e2e scenario from the Java SDK.   configtx.yaml, mychannel.tx, twoorgs.orderer.block and all the certs were copied from the node SDK test/fixture/channel directory.  I get this error after creating channel completes and I get the genesis block and I read the MSP certs into my trust store.  There are a few certs that looked suspicious , e.g.  channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/peerOrg2/msp/cacerts/peerOrg1.pem  which  when I do a  _openssl x509 -text -noout -in peerOrg1.pem_ , I get this {quote} Certificate: Data: Version: 4 (0x3) Serial Number: 1000 (0x3e8) Signature Algorithm: ecdsa-with-SHA256 Issuer: CN=peerOrg1 Validity Not Before: Feb 20 19:06:10 2017 GMT Not After : Feb 20 19:06:10 2018 GMT Subject: CN=peerOrg1 Subject Public Key Info: {quote}  Both  ~jimthematrix  and  ~ashutosh_kumar  think this is the problem   ></description> </Issue>

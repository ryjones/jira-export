CDATA  ~manish-sethi : thanks for the discussion on this one, whose conclusions I report here - feel free to amend  PROBLEM ======== Ledger doesn't support yet transactions with >1 action. However, the peer fails to mark such transactions as invalid. As a result, the following attack may be carried out: create two conflicting actions (e.g. double spending), put them both in the same transaction. The expected behaviour is that the tx is marked as invalid; the real behaviour is that the tx will be marked as valid, and so the creator may present false proof of the second action having being part of the ledger, whereas its action is discarded.  FIX === The validator code marks every transaction with >1 action as invalid (the change is tiny).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the CI test results, I see 8 proposal failures in channel1, and 3 proposal failures in channel0. If it is just the first few transaction proposals that are failing, but if it passes on local machine, then it seems like we are starting invokes before everything is initialized.  But I wonder if the first transaction is failing, or others. Try a test in the CI with just one invoke transaction per thread per peer, and turn on PTE debug logs to see each transaction. If that succeeds, then observe how long it takes (TPS). Maybe it is the 2nd and 3rd invokes that are failing (while the cc container is still being started by the 1st invoke on a given peer). I am not sure if this makes sense, because I thought the cc container initiated during the install, but something is going on here. What factors could cause it to fail only in the "no tls" network? We need to narrow down the problem to identify exactly what is failing and when and why.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Did GRPC give any details in a response field? Maybe SDK could return that, instead of just the status field ("status - 500"). This is not much help. We could ask for a better response; the node sdk could even wrap the grpc error in something more useful and relevant. Maybe: could not set up connection, or connection dropped, or service not available yet, or something...  Have you enabled PTE debug logs yet to figure out if it is the first few transactions that failed?  ></body> </Action>

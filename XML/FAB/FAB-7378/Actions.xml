CDATA Hi Yacov,   ~eragnoli  (Dublin Research Lab) and I (ICBI Singapore) are trying to understand and enhance the way endorsement policies are framed in Hyperledger Fabric, so this issue caught our eyes.  Can you elaborate on what precisely you mean by "computing subsets of principles"? Maybe with an example?  Also, I guess you mean "principal", right?  Rama  ></body> </Action>

Â   So as you know, an endorsement policy is a tree, with vertices of either NoutOf or principals. This tree has sub-trees, that the leaf level is composed only of principals, and these principals - if collected signatures from peers that satisfy these principals, then the endorsement policy is fullfilled.  ></body> </Action>

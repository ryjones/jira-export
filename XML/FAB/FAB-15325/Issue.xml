CDATA I'm using node for Fabtoken under Fabric 2.0 alpha. * have edited the fabtoken.js to change user1 to sam, user2 to don * added a third user, jack, by using cryptogen tool, specifically, at the basic-network directory, executed "cryptogen generate --config='./crypto-config3users.yaml' ", which created identity credentials for User3@org1.example.com under /crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users  * edited relevant code including createUsers function to reflect that The two users of sam and don functions well for token "issue", "transfer" and "list". However, Fabtoken failed on the third user, jack. Please see details below.  Observation: Fabtoken seems hard coded.  Questions: Does Fabtoken support more than two users? If so, how to add additional users? If using cryptogen to add a new user is insufficient, what else needs to be done? That is, what exact steps needs to be taken?  Let me know if you need an additional information.  Thanks.   ></description> </Issue>

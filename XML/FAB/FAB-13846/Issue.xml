CDATA Hi Fabric,  I tried to run the latest fabric 1.4 application(Fabric-Samples). As mentioned in the link  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations_service.html#id2    i tried to generate /metrics API by configuring metrics.provider as prometheus/statsd.  I assigned value in the orderer.yaml Metrics.Provider value as "statsd". In the orderer log also i can able to see, " Metrics.Provider = "statsd" " is printed. But, I can see one more log statement like   orderer.example.com|http://orderer.example.com/  | 2019-01-23 07:12:29.750 UTC  orderer.operations  Log -> WARN 164 err write udp 127.0.0.1:35392->127.0.0.1:8125: write: connection refused  orderer.example.com|http://orderer.example.com/  | 2019-01-23 07:12:29.750 UTC  orderer.operations  Log -> WARN 165 during WriteTo err write udp 127.0.0.1:35392->127.0.0.1:8125: write: connection refused   i am not configuring the Operations section in orderer.yaml, i just left default values as it is. again i changed Metrics.Provider = "prometheus" now the application is running as expected but, i can't able to see any metrics endpoints running in the machine  As mentioned, the application should generate /metrics endpoint. Ref Link https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations_service.html#id2 i am running application on a server.  i checked it like https://SERVER_IP:8125/metrics and https://SERVER_IP:7050/metrics -> since its is configured in orderer i checked with 7050 as well  can you please guide how exactly should i check the endpoint  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Once upon a time, the configtx package did far too much. It exposed the channel configuration for each component, it handled transactional state for the policy manager, and the other transaction components, and generally became something that too many packages linked to. Because of all the different packages which linked to it, the interface definitions were factored out into their own package configtxapi.  Since then, the vast majority of this function has been factored out into other more appropriate places, and there are no longer dependency cycles.  This CR moves the interface definitions back into the package, and changes the rather generic 'configtx.Manager' name to 'configtx.Validator' (as its only purpose now is to validate configtx updates before generating a new configuration). This renaming ripples throughout a fair bit of the code, but should be reasonably easy to review.  ></description> </Issue>

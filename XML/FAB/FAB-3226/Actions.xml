There will be a `logging.gossip` parameter (and parameters for other modules) that will override the default level for all gossip-related logging modules. Hoping to have it enabled by the end of this week. " created="2017-04-18 20:18:31.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2017-04-18 20:18:31.0"/>

CDATA Will has pushed this change set https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8439 and I have tweaked it a bit (but 99% of the work there is his... thanks  ~wlahti  !) and I have tested it locally (by running e2e and grepping for gossip logs *docker logs peer0 2>&1 | grep -i gossip*) and now at peer startup, gossip is running in WARN and not in DEBUG.   ></body> </Action>

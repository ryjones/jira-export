CDATA For some reason, we cannot run the unit tests in {{fabric/core}} in parallel.  I believe it may be related to some of the same reasons in FAB-5722, but I'm not generally certain of a root cause.  This is a serious hindrance on development because it multiplies the testing time by at least the number of available cores, if not substantially more.  Doing a comparison on my local laptop testing {{fabric/orderer/...}} and {{fabric/common/...}} natively with parallelization on takes 15 seconds.  Doing the same natively without parallization takes 1 minute.  The change is not quite as significant, but still noticeable when running {{make unit-test}}.  With {{-p 1}} set as is required today, those unit tests take 8 minutes, with that flag removed, the speed doubles to 4 minutes.  As this is the path of our CI, this might also double the speed of our CI which would be very welcomed.  ></description> </Issue>

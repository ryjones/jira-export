CDATA I'm not sure I understand this bug or maybe it's something that was resolved?  I think this bug is suggesting that the `-p 1` flag is set when running `make unit-test` for the fabric/core package. If you look at unit-test/run.sh it seems the flag is only used with the gossip package and the core package tests are run in parallel.  ></body> </Action>

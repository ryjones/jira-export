CDATA  ~satchell , {{make clean all}} would be appropriate in this situation.  It will never be perfect, as the Docker images are not files that {{make}} can examine the existence of or the timestamp on. There are many situations where you will just have to clean the build/images directory to get your docker image rebuilt.   ~lehors : That said, we might be able improve this a little bit based on the pattern we use for the other docker images: # Move the recipe of the {{build/docker/gotools}} target to a new {{build/docker/gotools/$(DUMMY)}} target and add a final {{touch @}} command to the recipe. # Make the {{build/docker/gotools}} target depend on the {{build/docker/gotools/$(DUMMY)}} and leave it's recipe empty.  With these changes, the {{build/docker/gotools/$(DUMMY)}} file would of not been created the first time around and the {{build/docker/gotools/$(DUMMY)}} target would of been re-run to create the gotools image.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris  I don't believe any of my changes would resolve this as I didn't change the docker targets. The go tools are built for native execution and, to preserve previous behavior, installed to $GOPATH/bin (with all of the assumptions around a single path element in GOPATH). The changes simply moved the makefile for the tools out of the gotools directory and to a top level file that's included into the Makefile.  I agree with  ~mastersingh24  that we should do what we can to move to a local build process that is less dependent on docker.  ></body> </Action>

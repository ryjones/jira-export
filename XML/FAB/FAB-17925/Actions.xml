CDATA  ~varadatibm  Is this still needed?  In 2.1.1, I checked the test-network and the MSP Name and ID now match:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/v2.1.1/test-network/configtx/configtx.yaml   In 1.4.8 - we were still on BYFN, so the mismatch is still there.  However I don't know if we will have someone start a new Fabric Project and bootstrap with BYFN 1.4.X, and anyone who is already on 1.4.X will not be updating their application because of this fix in Samples.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Actually, in the test network sample, the OrdererOrg ID and Name are still different:  Name: OrdererOrg ID: OrdererMSP   I agree it will be cleaner to use this work item to make them the same.     ></body> </Action>

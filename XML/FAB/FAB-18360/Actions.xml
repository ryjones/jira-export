This peer is an anchor peer.  {quote}Can you try not making it an anchor peer?{quote}  I think it isn't possible, because every organization in our network has only one peer.  {quote}They will forget about it at some point{quote}  Is there a different workaround? ;)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA First of all, if you are using 1.4.2 please upgrade to the latest version.  I think that the problem might go away if you wait long enough, unless you will crash out of memory before that: {quote}Additionaly: this peer has high memory and CPU usage, I think there is some sort of memory link. {quote} Yes I fixed it in 1.4.4 in this  commit|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/afbf88a . It probably also fixes your problem, because (according to myself, a year ago): {quote} When a peer rotates its certificate but preserves the endpoint, the PKI-ID of the peer changes. The membership module treats the old PKI-ID as a dead peer, and asks the communication module to open a connection to it, which it does, however - it associates the connection with the *new* PKI-ID and not the old. {quote}    ></body> </Action>

Why is such an informative description not a description of the issue!? I searched for the problem in the jira (by keywords "peer, certificate, reenroll, pki-id") and found nothing :(  Thank you so much. We are planning to upgarde to the latest version.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA On one hand, here we would need to refactor the code associated to membership service functionalities, i.e., code for signing w.r.t. a certificate, certificate signature verification to export the interface agreed within FAB-829. This would substitute the default membership service provider for fabric.  Another task associated to this story is that throughout the implementation of this default IDP we would need to make sure that crypto calls go through our BC-CSP that was implemented in FAB-355.  ></description> </Issue>

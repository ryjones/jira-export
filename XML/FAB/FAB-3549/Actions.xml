I&apos;ve found one bug in the method that results in a panic when the block is nil but I want to make sure to cover your exact scenario. " created="2017-05-31 15:41:29.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2017-05-31 15:41:29.0"/>

CDATA I looked a little closer and think I've resolved the bug reported here as well, which can occur when the payload header is nil.    https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9985/   ></body> </Action>

CDATA It's strange that it didn't panic before /configure.go:120 +0xa8a (joinChain). If this is triggered by empty blocks or header in blocks, it should panic at /configure.go:110  {code:java} // cid, e := utils.GetChainIDFromBlockBytes(args 1 ) {code}  ></body> </Action>

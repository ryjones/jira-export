CDATA The external chaincode launcher was added as part of the v2.0.0 release. This change allows users to break free of the dependency on the docker daemon inside the peer.  In particular users can launch chaincode as standalone servers, they can launch docker containers out of band running chaincode and connect to them, or they can launch separate kubernetes pods running the chaincode.  This story will encapsulate two test scenarios: * Launching the chaincode in Docker out of band and connecting to it * Launching the chaincode as a separate pod and connecting to it  Acceptance criteria: A daily test is run testing the functionality of the external launchers in docker and kubernetesÂ   ></description> </Issue>

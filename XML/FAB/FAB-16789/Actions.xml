CDATA I can pickup this fix.   ~denyeart   isn't the answer to the error you raised above:  Join requests need to go through endorser ?     The fix I am thinking: remove the orderer's participation description in the *join channel* section of the docs.  Instead, how about moving the orderers' participation description to the c*reate channel* section here https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network/network.html#creating-a-channel-for-a-consortium  so describe that creating channel  C1 requires the orderer O4. The *channel creation transaction* is sent to the orderer.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sijo.c  Thanks for picking this item up.  Just the text  "Once P1 is started, it can join channel C1 using the orderer O4. When O4 receives this join request" needs to be removed.  Join is an API call on the peer (but not an 'endorser' call). The channel's genesis block is passed to the peer's join API. Then the peer attempts to retrieve blocks from an orderer for that joined channel. The orderer checks permissions against the channel configuration, as the text states, and feeds the peer the blocks if it has permission.  So it's just the mechanics of the join that needs to be fixed in these two sentences.  ></body> </Action>

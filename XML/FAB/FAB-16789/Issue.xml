CDATA https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network/network.html   {code:java} A key part of a P1’s configuration is an X.509 identity issued by CA1 which associates P1 with organization R1. Once P1 is started, it can join channel C1 using the orderer O4. When O4 receives this join request, it uses the channel configuration CC1 to determine P1’s permissions on this channel. For example, CC1 determines whether P1 can read and/or write information to the ledger L1. {code}   The join request does not go to orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Go 1.7 now supports accelerated CRC computation for Z, required by Kafka. This code appears to have been integrated into klauspost/crc32 12 days ago - our vendor version was installed 20 days ago so we just missed it!  Also, once Go 1.8 is released I believe that we can lobby Shopify/sarama to drop the requirement for klauspost/crc32 and simplify our vendor library.  ></description> </Issue>

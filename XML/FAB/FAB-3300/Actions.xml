CDATA As a suggestion for the default instantiation policy for a chaincode installed on a peer P, would it make sense to consider the admin of MSP of P?    ~muralisr ,  ~ales ,  ~mne ,  ~adc , what do you think?  ></body> </Action>

Essentially this means that: * it allows only the MSP admin of P to instantiate CC packages that come without an instantiation policy. * after deploy, this instantiation policy is also in effect for upgrades of the chaincode. * it can be changed through a CC upgrade by the MSP admin of P.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mne , correct!   What is important is that although the instantiation policy is "nil" at installation time, during deploy instantiation policy related entry (that is filled by the corresponding endorser) needs to include the actual policy; otherwise the network will not be able to substitute the "nil" properly. Unless the default policy is assumed to be produced by the endorser certificate (e.g., its MSP admin), but this is already more complex.   What do you think?   ></body> </Action>

I see many boxes and arrows in the charts and  few related to the fabric-client SDK.  Will applications be using a new SDK to help with the other flows ?" created="2019-01-08 20:51:03.0" updateauthor="harrisob@us.ibm.com" updated="2019-01-08 20:51:03.0"/>

CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com    We have implemented a client package in go that can be used as a reference implementation for SDK. You may refer to token-client-design.docx in FAB-11153.  Download  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27608 |https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27608/4/integration/token/token_test.go and take a look at fabric/token/client package.  This client package has been used to run integration e2e tests for token transactions. You can look at CR   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27608/4/integration/token/token_test.go  to understand the e2e flow.  We need to enhance the existing SDK to support token transactions. In token client package, we used a single API to send request to prover peer and orderer, but SDK can use 2 separate APIs if it fits better to SDK flow. # SDK provides APIs (e.g., IssueTokens, ListTokens, TransferTokensetc.) that will communicate to prover peer and get back a TokenTransaction. If it makes more sense, SDK may provide a generic token API (e.g., sendTokenCommand with command name and parameters) to wrap individual commands. # SDK sends token transaction to the orderer and allows applications to listen to the transaction event        ></body> </Action>

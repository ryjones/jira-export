CDATA When a block is committed and it has private data and the data isn't present in the transient store, it is pulled from remote peers in iterations until the time threshold expires, or the private data is found.  In order to minimize the iteration number, we need to maximize the chance that the peers receiving the pull request would have the private data in question.  The peers that most certainly might have the private data are the peers that endorsed the private data in the first place.  Therefore, we should be able to prioritize pulling from endorsers if applicable.   ></description> </Issue>

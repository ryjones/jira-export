CDATA Create an interop test suite to replace the behave interop tests; refer to Items 71-74 of tab "Behave Testcases" of  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741 .  Send transactions with 1k and <49M payload with <dbType> <ordererType> <tlsType>  This jira is to create a PTE testcase to send transactions with payload size ranging from 1k and <49M. It can be used in systest, and essentially replace the need for an interop test in the CI merge/publish pipelines. To cover as many components as possible, this should be done in all three of our planned networks for system test: kafka_leveldb_no_tls, kafka_couchdb_tls, raft_couchdb_mutualtls. # (Dongming, FAB-15822) Add option for payload size to gen_cfgInputs 2. (Ramesh (suggested), FAB-16067) Add testcase to the 3 networks that sends 10 msgs with payload size 10K, then 4M, then 49M.  Update: After testing with variety of msg sizes and host containers GB RAM allocations, to automate a testcase that does not require too much (expensive) GB RAM in all fabric nodes in our hosts used for k8s cluster systemtests, we decided to send just two TX of size 50MB (using payload ~ 26 MB in the endorsement request), in two of our systemtest networks (kafka/leveldb/notls, and raft/couchdb/mutualtls). Refer to FAB-16720.  ></description> </Issue>

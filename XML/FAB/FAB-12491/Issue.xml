CDATA Smoke test and merge job are very redundant and vulnerable to breakages from components outside Fabric such as node chaincode and java chaincode.  Most CRs that would break end to end scenarios such as smoke test will be caught in integration test CI, now that the integration test suite has matured. Therefore the additional 15 minutes of smoke test for each CR patch is not very worthwhile. It would be acceptable to skip the smoke tests and just run the integration test and merge job, as long as we pay close attention to merge job failures.  ></description> </Issue>

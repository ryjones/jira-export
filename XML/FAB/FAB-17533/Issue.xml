CDATA The code added to implement the channel creation transaction made a copy of the bits of the policy parser into the pkg/config tree. "A little copying" is okay when done for small bits and to truncate the dependency tree but, in this case, we're making a copy of a large part of the existing implementation and we are still carrying the {{Knetic/govaluate}} dependency.  If cauthdsl has the code we need, we should try to work in that space to reduce the deps and refactor it for consumption as part of the library.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Is there any chance that the migration to go modules could be back-ported for the latest 1.x release (1.4.8 at the time of this writing)?  I want to write a chain code with the latest 1.x version, but really dislike the legacy package management of go and the need to manage $GOPATH and other env vars (personal preference).  If I understand it correctly all it would take is a single commit that adds a go.mod file on the 1.x branch and then a release of a minor version that gets tagged so go can pick it up as a version. Also happy to send a PR with this if people support the idea. Please advise.  ></description> </Issue>

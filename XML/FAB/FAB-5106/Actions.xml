CDATA Hello,   Is it possible to disable the INFO logging level? I tried to set --logging-level to DEBUG, but it did not override the INFO, just appended both in the log messages.  Thanks in advance.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The valid log levels for the logging package Fabric utilizes are:  {code:java} CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | NOTICE | INFO | DEBUG{code} These are in order from the least amount of logging to the most. Setting the level to one of these will include messages from that level and any to the left.  Therefore, if you'd like to disable logging at the INFO level, you need to set the level to at least NOTICE (or WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL if you'd like to restrict the logging further).   ></body> </Action>

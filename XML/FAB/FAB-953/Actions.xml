CDATA Discussed this with Bishop yesterday, the plan is to apply Bishop's patch + assign a deadChan per clientDeliverer (which is exactly how I deal with things in the revamped Broadcaster for multiple chains).  Wil get on it once FAB-819 is done.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In the revised code that is based on common components, the issue that Bishop witnessed will show up here:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/gitweb?p=fabric.git;a=blob;f=orderer/common/deliver/deliver.go;h=4b8441dea7d612b2dad1b0656ece65ea67ca3a3c;hb=refs/heads/master#l121  The signal channel can be shared among deliverers.  Let's keep track of how badly it affects us on this new revision, and we will prioritize a fix for this (minimizing the number of readers on the same channel) accordingly.  ></body> </Action>

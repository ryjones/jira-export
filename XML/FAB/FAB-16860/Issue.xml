CDATA In an effort to speed up our integration tests, we have begun using external builder for all of our new lifecycle integration tests.  This is good for speed, but we need to ensure that the existing platforms based approach does not break.  We also need to ensure that the existing metadata parsing from within a platform style package does not break.  This task may hopefully be fulfilled simply by modifying one of the existing new lifecycle tests to use the platform style packaging.  ></description> </Issue>

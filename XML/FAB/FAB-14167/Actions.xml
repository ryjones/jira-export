CDATA {quote}x509: certificate specifies an incompatible key usage{quote}  I expect you've generated your certificate with incorrect key usage or extended key usage attributes. The pictures of the messages and bytes is insufficient to determine if that's the case.  The cert should be configured with KeyUsageDigitalSignature and no extensions. The user certificates are for signing only and not TLS.  As for RSA, cryptogen only supports ECDSA so there's not a lot of testing with anything else.  ></body> </Action>

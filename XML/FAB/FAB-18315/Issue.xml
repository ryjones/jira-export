CDATA The intention in that task is that a channel that fails catastrophically will stop and report a new status {{types.StatusFailure}} instead of panicking and crashing the server.  If we had that error code already, I would be inclined to suggest that the map would include a struct with     {{  { cRel types.ClusterRelation status types.Status }  }}  you could then insert into the map \{"member", "inactive"} or \{"follower", "inactive"} when you start the removal, delete that when removal ends successfully, and put \{"member", "failure"} or \{"follower", "failure"} if something goes wrong.       Add new cluster status to existing gauge for node's status and report status when channel remove fails.   ></description> </Issue>

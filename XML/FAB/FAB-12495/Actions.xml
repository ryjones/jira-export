This one seems like it isn't really a security issue unless filling /tmp would be a problem for the container host--which it usually isn't due to resource limits on the temp dir that all Linux machines have by default.  Maybe there is something we can do with the docker config to prevent this but it doesn't seem necessary to me. It is important to point out that this person is assuming a very privileged position of the attacker.  Not only shell on the docker host, but also a shell with privileges to write to the docker socket.  If an attacker has a privileged position like that, breaking out of the docker containers is the least of our worries.  I'm going to say that this isn't a security issue and close it unless anybody has objections.  ></body> </Action>

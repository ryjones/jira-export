CDATA I'm looking at the fabcar and some sample queries (query: retrieval and invoke to write).  Even for the invoke with nodeJS, i see new car are simply array append.  Sure, as proposed new block, it needs endorsement/validation prior to being appended to the chain.  I'd love to see nodeJS code touching on the process of having approved new block appended to the chain/ledger and state change/update as well.  Does the "fabric-samples" cover that?  If so, where can I see such code?  Thanks in advance.     ></description> </Issue>

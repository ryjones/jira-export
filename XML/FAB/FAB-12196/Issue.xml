CDATA This paragraph in the network topic is not correct: {code:java} It’s also worth noting that S5 can have different implementations on peer nodes P1 and P2 – so long as they implement the same smart contract interface. It means that in principle, S5 could be implemented in GOLANG on peer node P1, and JavaScript on peer node P2!{code} Chaincodes must have the exact same fingerprint (hash) on each peer as the instantiated chaincode on the channel, otherwise invoke will fail with {color:#333333}error: chaincode fingerprint mismatch{color}.  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/network/network.html#network-completed  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, Fabric needs us to upgrade the chaincode to a different version for changing the endorsement policy or private data collections for a channel.  However, it is more desirable to upgrade the chaincode with the same version for changes made in endorsement policy or private data collections. This is because the chaincode.go remains the same while changing endorsement policy or private data collections.  Hence, upgrading chaincode to a different version makes no sense.     ></description> </Issue>

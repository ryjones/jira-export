CDATA Some tx messages will get dropped when tx load is high and CPU resources are fully occupied. the result is serious since you don't get noticed that your message was never processed.  this is because broadcaster queue is too small (currently hard coded to 10), should be a quick and easy fix though, ideally should be a config param.  func newBroadcaster(self uint64, N int, f int, broadcastTimeout time.Duration, c communicator) *broadcaster { 	queueSize := *{color:red}10{color}* // XXX increase after testing   I also wonder if it is better to just block the thread instead of discarding messages when channel is full    ></description> </Issue>

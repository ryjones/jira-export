CDATA  ~kchristidis :  {quote} Create a, say, Consenter object with a logger and the certificates that correspond to this OSN/replica (so that it can determine its own Raft node ID). Assume that the certificates are passed on to you via a etcdraftplugin.New() constructor from the configuration, similar to how the Kafka constructor reads the list of Kafka brokers. {quote}  not sure I'm 100% following you on this ^^^, can you expand a bit?  ></body> </Action>

Perhaps it's best to be a bit less prescriptive.  At the end of the day, the {{Chain}} — and more specifically the {{raft.Node}} encapsulated by the {{Chain}}) — needs to know the Raft ID it is assigned with.  How do we achieve this?  The design document|https://docs.google.com/document/d/138Brlx2BiYJm5bzFk_B0csuEUKYdXXr7Za9V7C76dwo/edit#heading=h.51n1zdupze13  covers this (Section C.II.2 "How do we assign Raft node IDs to consenter nodes", skip to the "When bootstrapping" part, pg. 15).  It basically comes down to: # Retrieving the channel configuration # Iterating over the {{Consenters}} slice contained there in # Comparing our own TLS client/server cert bytes, with the ones contained in the {{Consenters}} slice  The index in {{Consenters}} that corresponds to us (+1 because Raft IDs are non-zero) is our Raft ID.  So I would argue that your {{etcdraft.New}} constructor _needs_ access to the configuration. (As an example,  see this Gist|https://gist.github.com/kchristidis/47cf9b996e6ae2c67f1b84e6fbad9cf3 , which should be augmented for both client and server certs.)  But perhaps there is a better way to achieve this? Let me know what you think.  ></body> </Action>

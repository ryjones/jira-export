CDATA As with FAB-15795 we are trying to consolidate the assorted block metadata fields in use by the orderer under the single 'signature field'.  The last config value is stored in the new way, but, it is still being written to the old location for backwards compatibility reasons.  This task is to audit usage of this field in the peer and peer CLI, as well as the SDKs.  These tools likely rely on this field for retrieving the most recent config block, and they should transition away from this field, to use the one from the signature field.  ></description> </Issue>

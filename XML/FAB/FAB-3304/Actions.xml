CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris  would say working as designed. This is a placeholder for SDK moving away from sending raw ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for install and using the SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec instead.

This issue is being bulk moved to Future.  If the issue is indeed high priority for v1.2 and/or very low effort, please move back to v1.2 and add a comment to indicate rationale." created="2018-03-23 05:07:54.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-03-23 05:07:54.0"/>

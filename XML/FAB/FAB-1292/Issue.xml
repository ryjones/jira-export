CDATA In order to sync immutable entities in gossip one needs to implement an entire interface (the pullAdapter in gossip/algo/pull.go) and keep an in-memory store of messages that are synced using the pull mechanism. This is cumbersome.  It would be good to be able to have a container class that holds the messages and also implementes the pull adapter, and can be instantiated for any type of immutable gossip message.  ></description> </Issue>

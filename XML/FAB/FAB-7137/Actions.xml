CDATA {quote}As per Peer CLI documentation - the support for TLS connectivity is only with Orderer Endpoint {quote} Can you please tell how you infer this? Because If the peer is running with TLS_ENABLED=true, then you won't be able to connect to it without using TLS.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I just looked at the script once again, may be there is confusion in our understanding, So  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh#L36  ==> is the TLS root of trust for Peer Node and `{{ --cafile }}` is the root of trust for orderer node.   And Join and Install are operations explicitly on Peer where orderer is not involed and hence `{{ --cafile }}` is not specified.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/examples/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh#L91    Discussed with  ~yacovm  for confirmation. This issue can be marked as not-a-defect.  ></body> </Action>

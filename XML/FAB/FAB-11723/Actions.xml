CDATA  ~odowdaibm  If this is going to be a standalone work item, I'd prefer if it have no parent 'Epic'.  If you expect multiple Stories will be needed, then the Epic umbrella is appropriate.  Also we have a new issue type of 'Documentation'.  Unless you really wanted this to be a Story, we could do a Move-->Move and change this to a Documentation issue type.  ></body> </Action>

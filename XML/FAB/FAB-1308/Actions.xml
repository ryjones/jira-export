CDATA Can we have a fix for the point 1Â as any provisioning done on the _security object for additional capability (like read-only user) would result peer rewriting it with default. There could be other organization, which already has the _security object defined and would result to break it. We would be in the same state once we run with Fabric v.1.2.   ~sanchezl   ~ashkumar   Utilizing the couch database for all type of production related operational support is another benefit (avoids going through the peer) an organization can use for using couch database as world state ledger.  After changing the description for the current Jira - FAB-11155 looks related.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA While this is an edge case and should not happen too often, I think it's best to finish out the implementation as originally designed in FAB-5096:   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORt3HFE13gnq204lXNp6i1BpMLMm-RAKVts8cH50kK4/edit#   (see Proposed Approach section in page 5).     Further clarification from Manish chat on Nov 22nd:  As a summary, the deal was that if gossip is able to get any config (that enables) - in between most recent block and most recent config below the pvtdata in question, the asking peer is given access.  The way to achieve this was expected as below...  In a loop, gossip pulls the above mentioned config, using the MostRecentCollectionConfigBelow() api.  In the loop, if the config evaluates to true, the loop returns. Else, it continues for pulling the next config blow the ‘committing block of config used in the previous iteration’. The final circuit breaker for the loop is the config ‘most recent below pvtdata in question’.     And as an optimization, it would be better if the code first checked both end points, the most recent config and config effective at block height in question (as is done in v1.4.0 code), before checking the inbetween configs (as proposed in this Jira).     ></body> </Action>

CDATA The Orderer Test Engine (OTE) tool is an extension of a developer tool. System tests can be done using other available test performance tools (e.g. fabric-test tools NL, PTE, and Operator, and HFRD), so we seek to remove the burden of maintaining this tool. Clean up the following, on master branch AND in release-1.4 : * +CI+:  Abandon the daily CI job for fabric-test OTE tests (Note: it should be already abandoned in master branch; remove it from 1.4 too.) * +CI+: Remove the OTE results from the fabric-test daily results job * +fabric-test+: Remove all references to OTE tool and tests from the Makefile and README and regression/daily/ and regression/smoke/. * +fabric-test+: Remove fabric-test/tools/OTE/  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Join application channel with join-block as follower.  Define a 3 node raft cluster without a system channel. Join 2 of these to the channel. Submit a few transactions for the  ledger height to be >>1. Submit a config TX (change something other than consensus related stuff) so that the last config will be number > 0.  Start the 3rd node w/o channels. Get the last config block  from one of the 2 active cluster nodes and join the channel on the 3rd node.  Check that the 3rd node pulls all the blocks.  Check the cluster-relation (=follower) and status for the transition (onboarding->active).  Submit some transactions to verify the 3rd pulls blocks.  Submit a config TX that adds the 3rd node to the consenters set.  Submit a few TXs to the 4th to verify it mutated into an etcdraft.Chain.   ></description> </Issue>

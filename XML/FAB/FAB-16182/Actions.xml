<Action id="62816" issue="41582" author="caod" type="comment" body="After some discussion with  ~manish-sethi  we&apos;ve decided that this work is too much effort and not required for the validation path refactor to do at this moment. Throwing this back in the backlog to address in the future. Some considerations we talked about were that we want to pass around a real SimpleCollectionStore that wraps the QueryExecutorFactory, ChaincodeInfoProvider, and IdentityDeserializerFactory, but all of the existing tests in coordinator and puller are reliant on mocking the CollectionStore interface. Making any minor changes to the interface or pulling anything into a real breaks the entire structure of how the tests are organized right now and refactoring the tests has become a large scale endeavor." created="2019-08-12 19:20:43.0" updateauthor="caod" updated="2019-08-12 19:20:43.0"/>

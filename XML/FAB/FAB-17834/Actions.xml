CDATA I think there is something even better we can do, to close this story, though. We can just remove the field from the protobuf definition and setup signing MSPs via a different code path.  The protobuf was there for verifying MSPs and not for local MSPs which are verifying MSPs that a private key was glued to them. This would ensure 100% that there is no problem in setting it to not nil.   ></body> </Action>

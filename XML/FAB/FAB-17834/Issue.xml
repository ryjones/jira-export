CDATA Currently, a user can manually modify a signing identity info and submit it for a config update. Realistically this value should always be nil and we should never actually use it for anything but because it can be modifiable we should check to see if doing so could cause any unwanted side effects. One example would be setting a signing identity that will eventually expire which could invalidate the channel config.      /cc  ~jyellick   ></description> </Issue>

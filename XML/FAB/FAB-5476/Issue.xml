CDATA When installing chaincode you provide a path, ID, and version.  All three attributes become part of a "fingerprint" that must match when invoking chaincode. The issue appears when you install the same chaincode but used a *different* path.  This situation will happen organically when different people on the same channel want to run the chaincode independently.  example:  person A installs on Peer1 with: *path* - /uhoh/chaincode/marbles/dir, *id* - marbles *version* - v1  and person B installs on Peer2 with: *path* - /marbles *id* - marbles *version* - v1  then lets pick Person A to instantiate the chaincode on a channel both peers have joined. the intent was that each person would have their own chaincode running, but b/c the path is different invokes will fail to run on person B's peer.  the error in the peer:  {code} error:  Chain.js : Chain-sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Error executing chaincode: Could not get deployment transaction from LSCC for uisdk:v - Get ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for uisdk/uisdk from LSCC error: chaincode fingerprint mismatch data mismatc {code}  everything works normally if the paths are identical.  this was tested with v1.0.0 fabric and v1.0.0 fabric-client (sdk).  ></description> </Issue>

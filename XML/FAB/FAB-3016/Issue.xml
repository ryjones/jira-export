CDATA Composer includes a generic chaincode that is used for the deployment of a all business networks. The business network definition that contains the model files, script files, and ACL rules (which describe a business network), are passed into the generic chaincode and stored in the world state.  Currently for v1.0 we have to install and instantiate the generic chaincode for every business network with a chaincode ID that matches the business network ID (for example org.acme.carauction).  It would be ideal if we could install the generic chaincode once, with an ID of something like hyperledger.composer, and then instantiate it multiple times within the same channel or across multiple channels with the business network ID. The business network definition is passed in via the chaincode Init() function during instantiate.  For example: # Install hyperledger.composer chaincode onto each peer. # Instantiate car auction business network as org.acme.carauction by instantiating hyperledger.composer chaincode with the car auction business network definition. # Instantiate truck auction business network as org.acme.truckauction by instantiating hyperledger.composer chaincode with the truck auction business network definition.  ></description> </Issue>

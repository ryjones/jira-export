CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I'd like to call more appropriate functions on a ConfigTx type that return the base and updated config. Currently the function Base() isn't very clear as to what it should accomplish. We should consider renaming this to something more appropriate (eg. BaseConfig, OriginalConfig, OldConfig, etc...) and likewise rename Updated() to something similar (ie UpdatedConfig).  Â   *Acceptance*  The Base() and Updated() functions and associated GoDocs are updated to reflect the new names.  ></description> </Issue>

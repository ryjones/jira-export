CDATA Currently, VSCC validation phase is inactive during MVCC validation and state update. Though the MVCC and state update takes a few milliseconds, it would be better to utilize CPU during this period for VSCC validation. To do that, we need to validate multiple blocks in VSCC validation phase (special cases during config block). An initial implementation is available with v1.0 (not v1.1) –  https://github.com/thakkarparth007/fabric/commits/msp_opt_AND_parVSCC_AND_pipelineVSCC_Commit_AND_couchBatching    After an initial performance evaluation, we will update the performance number here. This approach is especially useful when the block size is lower than the number of vCPU cores allocated for the peer and there is only one channel in the network.   ></description> </Issue>

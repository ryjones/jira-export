CDATA Many applications require that they have a definite answer from some point onwards on whether their transaction will ever be included in the ledger.  For example, a client has submitted a transaction and after an hour the transaction has not appeared to the peers that client maintains.   We can easily do this    - (assuming there is no real-world time in the ledger) by leveraging epochs, ie., logical clock set/updated via the block counts   - (assuming there is a real-world time in ledger) by leveraging the ledger time.   The idea is that we know that a tx will be included in the ledger if and only if the time included in the tx (and set by the endorsers) is consistent with the time of the ledger. Again, this "time" can be logical (e.g., epochs), or real-world (by leveraging real-world time of the endorsers, and the ledger).     ></description> </Issue>

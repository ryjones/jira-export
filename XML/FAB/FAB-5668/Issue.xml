To be able to tell apart clients from peers from orderers, we plan to leverage the organisational units of an MSP identity. Of course, each fabric network instance might have its own way to identify clients, peers and orderers therefore we plan to enhance the FabricMSPConfig adding a new structure called FabricNodeOUs. An instance of FabricNodeOUs allows to define the organisational unit names for clients, peers and orderers. An MSP identity will be considered valid only if it can be identified as a client, peer or orderer. FabricNodeOUs also allows to disable this check, if needed." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-08-08 18:21:37.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:49:26.0" resolutiondate="2017-10-20 13:09:12.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="39674"/>

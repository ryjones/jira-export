CDATA Some comments ...  1) When we start making access control decisions in fabric based on OUs, this will put requirements on fabric CA. For example, Alice registers Bob to be a client with the fabric-ca-server; however, Bob enrolls and specifies the OU for a peer in the CSR. This means Bob is authorized as a peer by MSP even though Alice intended Bob to have a client identity with no peer authorization. So this means the fabric-ca-server must have a way of limiting what Bob can specify in the CSR.  To address this issue, I've opened FAB-6871.   2) A single OU name may not be unique. For example, you could have the following two DNs: a) CN=Alice,OU=Admin,OU=Finance,O=org1,...        - where Alice is an admin in the finance dept b) CN=Bob,OU=Admin,OU=Engineering,O=org1,...   - where Bob is an admin in the engineering dept You may want Alice to be a peer admin but not Bob.  From looking briefly at the current change sets, I don't think this is handled.  I personally think we need a general purpose expression language which is extensible and would allow customers to specify peer, orderer, client, or other roles as needed based on this language. For example, an expression required to be true for the peer role: "OU in  'Admin', 'Finance' ".   ></body> </Action>

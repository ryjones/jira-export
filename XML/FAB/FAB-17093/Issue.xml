CDATA Per https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/34401#message-eccb8901_793a8c92  The protolator decoration stuff https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/33139a966bb75377f65c5d9dc990619bd80ca22d/common/tools/protolator/protoext/decorate.go is currently missing any sort of tests.  Some changes would be caught by integration tests, but a more  basic level of unit testing, ensuring that we are not accidentally omiting decoration of a type we intend to decorate would be nice.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Since version 1.5, the go tool has allowed package authors to separate internal details from those that are expected by to be user-consumable. This is accomplished by placing internal packages in directories that include "internal" in the name.  We should restructure the fabric repository to explicitly place our implementations under fabric/internal and only leave the packages we expect users to consume outside of that root.  Not only will this help make it clearer to users what they should and should not use, it will help us as with semantic versioning.  /cc  ~mastersingh24   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the local.ini is placed in the /etc/local.d directory.  This file should be in the /etc directory based on the documentation:   http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/config/intro.html   Also, the couchdb username and password are currently placed in /etc/local.d/docker.ini.  When couchdb is started, the password is hashed and stored in the /etc/local.ini.   The password in the docker.ini is left in clear text.    Writing the username and password to the /etc/local.ini will prevent passwords being left in clear text.     ></description> </Issue>

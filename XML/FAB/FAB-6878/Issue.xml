CDATA The test case *test_FAB6490_Using_FCA_With_ACL_Permissioning* prevents all the following tests from running. Can there be a fix(for now and later) that allows the remaining tests to run gracefully without having to depend on a failed test. Doing this would allow all the tests to run irrespective of their dependent tests.

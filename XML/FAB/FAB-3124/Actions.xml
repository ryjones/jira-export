CDATA Ok,  ~binhn  confirmed that we leave it to the app to decide which version to move a chaincode's instance in a chain to.  ~mne  interesting proposal for changing the name, since we are not enforcing any "upgrade" to actually take place.   ~binhn ,  ~muralisr  what do you think?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ellaki   version being arbitrary string with no metric properties agree with  ~binhn  to leave it to user to upgrade. Indeed they may find they want to backout a change and go back to a previous version.   "reinstantiate" feels like "reset" with the same chaincode but could work... others are "changeversion" ? "applyversion" ?  Or we leave it as "upgrade" ....   ></body> </Action>

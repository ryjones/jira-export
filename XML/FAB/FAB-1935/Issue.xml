CDATA In https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1668, we capture the read-set from the items that are consumed by a transaction in order to detect any phantom item during validation. However, in case of certain queries the number of results in the range query can be significantly large. The proposal is to preserve in the read-write-set, the hash of the read-set related to the range queries if this is beyond certain size instead of the actual read-set.  ></description> </Issue>

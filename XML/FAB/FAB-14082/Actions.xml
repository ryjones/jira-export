<Action id="58441" issue="37470" author="glindsell" type="comment" body=" ~binhn  Absolutely, there have been successful tests load balancing streams at the request level within an individual k8s cluster (which obviously has limited benefits given the distributed nature of HLF technology) and I still have open issues which are being worked on with the Linked community:  https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/2120  for load balancing _between_ different k8s clusters. So I can certainly provide specific guidance w.r.t how it is possible to load balance gRPC at the request level within the same k8s cluster and how it _should_ be possible between them once these issues are resolved (and more generally the aim for load balancing across platform agnostic deployments). Let me know where this is to be documented and I can write something up." created="2019-03-22 11:17:24.0" updateauthor="glindsell" updated="2019-03-22 11:18:06.0"/>

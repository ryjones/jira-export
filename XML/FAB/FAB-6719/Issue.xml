CDATA Hyperledger Fabric allows inter-changeable components such as transaction endorsement and validation checks by extracting out this functionality into system chaincodes. Users can provide custom system chaincodes to implement application specific behaviour.  Due to limitations in the Go language at the time of implementation, system chaincodes were statically compiled into the peer. Users must change fabric source code and recompile the peer to include custom system chaincode. This design can be improved by using Go plugins available since 1.8.  We propose to allow loading system chaincodes as plugins. Once loaded, they will behave like regular system chaincodes compiled into the peer.  ></description> </Issue>

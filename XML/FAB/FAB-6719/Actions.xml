CDATA  ~divyank  The scc plugin I'm developing depends on {{libltdl}}, which is dynamically linked. Therefore, we require peer docker image to come with {{libltdl-dev}} installed. Instead of having user rebuild their peer image, I wonder if we could make this dependency part of official peer image, or even baseimage. So I'm just checking if other scc plugins need it.  cc  ~mastersingh24   Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA All system chaincodes transitively depend on libtool through shim -> bccsp -> pkcs11 -> libtool.  As of today, if you have a dynamically built peer that has not disabled PKCS11, you will need custom peer images with libtool available at runtime. We do this by using a custom base image and the BASE_DOCKER_NS make option in the fabric build.  Previous attempts to add ltdl to baseimage have met arguments about how PKCS11 should be distributed with fabric.

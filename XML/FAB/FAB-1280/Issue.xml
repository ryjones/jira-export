CDATA The orderer has some common code which is of broader use to the fabric at large, not just the orderer.  In particularly, the configuration block parsing, and the policy parsing and evaluation are prime candidates for being shared in a modular way between the orderer and peer (and possibly other components).  This is being created in part by the request of  ~muralisr  to faciliate some VSCC ESCC work.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The v1.x implementation of LSCC stored all of the chaincode information (except for collections) in a single monolithic value using protobuf.  This has the problem that any change to the chaincode definition invalidates all in-flight requests, so for instance changing the endorsement policy (which has no affect on the output of the tx) will invalidate a transaction unnecessarily.  Therefore, it's desirable to have a way to store individual structure fields as keys, but without introducing the complexity of serializing all fields individually.  The implementation should allow for abitrary structures with int64, uint64, string, and byte fields to be serialized.   ></description> </Issue>

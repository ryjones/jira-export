CDATA If the system channel has no application channels at all and the system channel contains only the genesis block + a system channel configuration transaction, the system chain's height will be 2, and the last config block's height will be 1.  The code that pulls a channel's blocks implicitly assumes the last config block of the system channel isn't a config block of sequence 1, because that can only happen if we create a network and then decide to onboard a new orderer node, before creating an application channel.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In order to decouple plugins and host programs, go plugins should not depend on the host program's symbol. (See  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20481    https://github.com/akutz/gpds  )  The current bccsp interface is not implemented according to this best practice, so the bccsp plugin must be compiled and packaged in the same project with the fabric source code, and it needs to be recompiled synchronously when the fabric version is upgraded.  ></description> </Issue>

Is there any particular reason why we&apos;re calling these extended unit tests? I would think that we want are integration tests that work against the orderer binaries, i.e. all of this work should be done under the top-level `integration` package, and by extending `nwo`. Do you have something different in mind?" created="2018-10-18 00:22:19.0" updateauthor="kchristidis" updated="2018-10-18 00:22:19.0"/>

CDATA I agree on the need for this.   ~kchristidis  I too believe that this is more of an extended unit test. For testing these scenarios we don't need the other pieces of the fabric system like the peers to be up. We can test these within the orderer code base itself keeping the scope precise.  ></body> </Action>

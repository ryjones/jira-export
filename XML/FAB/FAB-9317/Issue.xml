CDATA The first-network currently uses an insecure endorsement policy of "OR(....)".  This was done because of the limitations in the peer CLI of gathering only a single endorsement.  With that limitation removed, the first-network sample should be updated to use a secure default endorsement policy requiring endorsements from both participants.  Note, when the chaincode is upgrade for the addition of an org, it should be added into the AND, perhaps as a 2/3 or 3/3 rule.  ></description> </Issue>

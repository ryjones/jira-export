CDATA The configtxlator is with very hacker style, but seems it's the only way we can use till now.  Maybe we should let peer support more config update API post v1.0.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="27128" issue="18133" author="jyellick" type="comment" body=" ~baohua  I totally agree that {{configtxlator}} isÂ not a very polished experience, and the hope is, that it is not a long term solution.  It is anticipated that the SDKs will be enhanced to natively support more configuration manipulation in the future, but {{configtxlator}} was a relatively straightforward stopgap solution for v1.  I&apos;d also agree that we could develop a chaincode for the peer to automate many of the &apos;out of band&apos; pieces of the flow, but again, for v1 this wasn&apos;t practical." created="2017-06-21 14:33:22.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2017-06-21 14:33:22.0"/>

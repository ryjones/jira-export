CDATA As a consumer of the fabric-config API attempting to migrate a fabric 1.0 channel, I would like to use the configtx library to remove the top level orderer addresses in my 1.0 channel config in favor of later adding them to the orderer org instead. We should not allow people to update the OrdererAddresses field and instead only support a function for removing it. New genesis blocks should also be created without the top level field but instead require the orderer orgs to specify orderer endpoints (tl;dr required at org level when creating, optional when updating)  Â   *Acceptance*  I should be able to call a function `RemoveLegacyOrdererAddresses` from the top level of a new ConfigTx's channel group to remove the legacy config value.  ></description> </Issue>

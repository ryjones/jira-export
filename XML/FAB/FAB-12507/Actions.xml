CDATA _Endorsement policy is specified at the channel/chaincode level, not the collection level, so in this case it would be three out of ten, it just happens to be that only the 5 orgs authorized for the private data would be eligible to endorse transactions that require read/write of private data._     Do you think it depends on the type of endorsement policy whether its three out of ten or three out of five?  E.g. if the endorsement policy states that all 3orgs should endorse then those orgs should be the ones who are authorized for the private data otherwise the invoke transactions would fail due to not satisfying the endorsement policy.  All I want to make sure is that at least one of org in the endorsement policy must be authorised for private data so that transactions do not fail. let me know if this understanding is correct.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sheetal-hlf  If you do a read/write transaction, then by definition only those peers that are collection members and have the private data will be able to endorse.  Does that satisfy the requirement?  Alternatively, you could use the new state-based endorsement in v1.3 which allows for specifying endorsement policy at the key level.  Note that placing an endorsement policy at the collection level is a potential future enhancement (between the chaincode and key levels), I assume that is more aligned with what you are looking for. What do you think between the three approaches?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA My concern is addressed in another  Jira ticket|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11141  ; however I have another query.  As per initial design, would the unauthorized endorsing peer also disseminate private data to peers as per collection-policy attributes requiredPeerCount and maxPeerCount?   P.S.  Endorsement policy - AND(Org1MSP.member, Org2MSP.member);  Collection policy OR(org1.member), "requiredPeerCount": 1, "maxPeerCount": 2,  and its a write-only transaction  ></body> </Action>

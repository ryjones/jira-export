CDATA In transaction simulation we allow setting the metadata associated with a key as a map<metadatakey:metadatavalue>. This is used currently by the feature key based endorsement. In the simulation, the read write set builder converts this map into kvrwset.KVMetadataWrite which then gets serialized during commit.   In the validation refactoring work, a transaction processor could set the metadata directly in the form of a map during its execution during commit phase and hence it would be required to serialize the metadata directly from the map.  ></description> </Issue>

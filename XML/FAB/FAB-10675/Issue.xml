CDATA To my knowledge, there is no way of obtaining the peers of the channel in the discovery implementation in node SDK.  the channel object has an underscore method *_discover* which issues a config or an endorser or a local peer query, but doesn't have the ability to have a channel contexed query that returns the peers of the channel.  Â  * It can be nice to have an ability to retrieve the peers of the channel from the API * It can be nice that the method itself won't be an underscore method and would be part of the official API, with samples and all.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~kchristidis ,  Since we are going to possible have at least 4 "Batch" configuration parameters, I can use this task to introduce a {{Batch}} level in the {{General}} config. e.g.:  {code} General: Batch: Timeout: 10s MaxMessageCount: 10 SizeBytes: 400000 MaxSizeBytes: 999000 {code}  Let me know what you think.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Strong yes on `BatchSize` (or Size) becoming `BatchMaxMessageCount` (or MaxMessageCount). If we are to keep the old term around, this "Size" term is going to throw us off (we will always be wondering whether we are talking about number of messages, or filesize, etc.)  We'll obviously have to get others to agree on it, but the "Batch" level proposal in the comments sounds like a great way of going at it.  ></body> </Action>

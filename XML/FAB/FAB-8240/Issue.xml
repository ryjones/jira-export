CDATA As  ~jyellick  described , copying content from  here|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8193  {code:java} The configuration parameter in configtx.yaml, Orderer addresses is an enumeration of orderer which clients and peers should use to connect to ordering. It is not an exhaustive list of orderers, and adding and removing nodes from this list has no impact on their participation in ordering. This is a deliberate feature by design, as it may be desirable to configure hot spare orderers, or to remove an orderer from the list for maintenance, recovery etc.  To disconnect an orderer from Kafka, standard Kafka access control measures may be leveraged, such as TLS CRLs, or firewalling. If the orderer system and its key material were compromised, its certificate should be added to the orderer's MSP's CRL. {code} This needs to be captured both in the configtx.yaml and the readthedocs.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The first pass of the detect, compile, launch infrastructure was implemented with a collection of  command line switches. This will become unwieldy over time as implementers will have difficulties ignoring unknown flags and parameters - especially flags that accept values.  Instead we should remain consistent with the buildpack model that already exists - namely, we provide a list of directories that contain extracted files. If we need to provide more data, we can add an additional argument or populate additional files. This means that implementations should ignore extra arguments as a general rule until they know what they point to.  build should receive receive arguments for the metadata directory, a directory containing the extracted source, and a directory for it to store its output.  Acceptance: external scripts do not need to process flags; existing parameters are reworked to fit this model.  ></description> </Issue>

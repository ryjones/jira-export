CDATA "until the TPS is stable": With the low number of threads, we may may not send sufficient transactions to stress the blockchain.  We plan to increase to the number of threads to a point that hits the max throughput of the blockchain network.

At any rate, once we identify the delta, let's describe this JIRA simply by its delta compared to FAB-13641, i.e.  "Like FAB-13641, except we'll now do: ..."  ></body> </Action>

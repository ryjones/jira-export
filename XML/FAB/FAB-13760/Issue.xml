CDATA h2. Setup Same setup as in FAB-13601, with the following differences: # 3 channels: {{channel1-3}} # 3 peers with 1 peer/org # all peers participating in all channels # {{batchSize.maxMessageCount}} = 500 # logging level set to {{error}} (and if we see errors, then we can re-run test with debug-level logs in the orderer package per FAB-13597)  h2. Inputs # Start 9*m thread transactions to each org's peer in each channel, i.e., the first 3 threads to the 3 orgs of {{channel1}}, the next 3 threads to the 3 orgs of {{channel2}},Â  and the last 3 threads to the 3 orgs of {{channel3}}. That makes a total of 9 threads when {{m}} = 1. Repeat traffic tests using increasing values of {{m}} = 1, 2, 3, ... until the overall TPS does not increase with a larger value for {{m}}. # Each thread sends 10K invokes, using PTE constant mode, i.e. sending next transaction as soon as the previous one is sent to and ACK'd received by the ingress orderer. # All transactions from a single thread will target the same orderer. # The orderer load-balancing will be handled at the channel level, i.e. thread 1 will target O1, thread 2 O2 and thread 3 O3.  h2. Expectations # No errors in the logs of peers and orderers. # No failures or errors reported by PTE. # All transaction events are received by PTE. # TPS (Transactions Per Second) overall rates will be provided for each test (for the varying values of {{m}}).  ></description> </Issue>

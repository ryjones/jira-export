CDATA http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html  Instructions for downloading the Samples contain this information: git clone -b master https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git cd fabric-samples git checkout \{TAG} Note:  To ensure the samples are compatible with the version of Fabric binaries you download below, checkout the samples {{\{TAG}}} that matches your Fabric version, for example, v1.1.0. To see a list of all fabric-samples tags, use command “git tag”.  ------------------------------  Problem:  Both Nancy and I checked out the wrong version of the binaries (v1.0.0) and ended up following the Tutorial instructions in the doc for v1.1.0. This creates problems - most notably that Node.js chaincode was not supported in v1.0.0. So if you try to follow the v1.1.0 instructions for deploying  node.js chaincode it will fail.  Action:  It would be good to give more guidance (warning?) here about what to specify for the TAG value.  I would even suggest # putting the Note: text before  the git checkout \{TAG} instruction # warn them, if they want to use node.js chaincode they will need v1.1.0 or higher.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Towards a refactoring of the validation/committer, we need to decouple signature/identity validation and policy checking. This change-set enables this by changing the signature of the function that internally evaluates the policy: instead of directly invoking functions to  deserialize the supplied identity, checking compliance of the identity with an MSP principal and verifying a signature, it calls functions of a suitable interface. Implementers of the interface are then free to perform any appropriate precomputation.   ></description> </Issue>

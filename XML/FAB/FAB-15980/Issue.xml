CDATA Refer to Item 36 of tab "Behave Testcases" in shared google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741   Existing test 'integration/gossip/gossip_test.go It("solo network with 2 orgs, 2 peers each, should sync from the peer if no orderer available")' stops the 2nd peer of first org and both peers of 2nd org, sends TXs, and starts all again. Call this existing code = PartA.  Peer0 is likely the leader (especially after the other peers are stopped). Extend PartA, call this PartB, to subsequently stop peer0 (the leader of Org1), send TXs, and restart it and confirm it rejoins (it should step down to become non-leader) and catches up its ledger.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I did a proof of concept for this to prove it works. I was able to delete the ledger blockstore and raft WAL/snapshot directories for all orderers, copy the ledger blockstore from a peer, and then provide a flag at orderer startup to have each orderer append a dummy block with empty consensus metadata and an empty transaction. The orderers rebuilt the WAL/snapshot directories and were fully functional, as hoped/expected.Â   Returning this task to TODO until it is prioritized. I have some rough code that will require cleanup that can be used as a starting point for the production code change. The integration test code should be good to go.  ></body> </Action>

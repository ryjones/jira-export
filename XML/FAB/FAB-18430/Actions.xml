CDATA  ~suneel18  Chaincode installation and management on a peer does indeed require admin privilege on the peer.  Regular users should not know which chaincodes the admin has installed on a peer, because regular users cannot do anything with a chaincode that is only installed on a peer but not deployed to a channel. Regular users can check which chaincodes are available on a channel that they want to interact with using:  old lifecycle: {code:java} peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel{code} new lifecycle: {code:java} peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted -C mychannel{code} Since this is working as designed and not a bug, I will close for now.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Jira isn't really the appropriate place for asking support questions, it is a place for raising bug and feature requests. You can ask the same question on chat.hyperledger.org or through our mailing list at:  fabric@lists.hyperledger.org|mailto:fabric@lists.hyperledger.org   That being said, when you ask on RocketChat or our mailing list, please include the entire log from your peer so we can see why the database failed to be created.  Thank you  ></body> </Action>

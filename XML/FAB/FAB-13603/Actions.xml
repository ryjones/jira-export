<Action id="55509" issue="36626" author="scottz" type="comment" body="We start preliminary testing by using only the system channel, without creating an application channel and without sending any transactions, and stop one of the followers. Once that is understood and ok, we will start over and create the applic channel (and add traffic), and stop the orderer that is the leader of the application channel." created="2019-01-10 19:48:40.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-01-10 19:48:40.0"/>

<Action id="55847" issue="36626" author="scottz" type="comment" body="I edited the description and addressed your comments. The table helps to explain how we simplified the testcase and broke it down into simpler steps and tests, e.g. to be able to focus on the leader changes without traffic cluttering the logs, working up to the actual two test scenarios documented. Because we did so many things, the test description had evolved to be less specific. We adapted the testcase description in this way rather than splitting off to write more testcases. One can discuss pros (shared description for very similar testcases) and cons (confusing with multiple scenarios in one place) and how to do things differently, but this is how we handled it for this one." created="2019-01-18 23:01:20.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-01-18 23:01:20.0"/>

CDATA In a multichannel Fabric setup, where members all have deployed the same chaincode but have sub-ledgers, the client sometimes doesn't know which subledger(s) will respond to its request (or more generally handle its message). In such cases, the client should have the ability to broadcast its request to multiple subledger(s) at once.   *+API+*  The client should be able to request delivery of a transaction proposal request to one or many channels. Once each peer receives the request, the invoked user CC will examine the request and execute (if its logic determines that responding is appropriate). Handling the results of this execution is out of scope of this ticket.  See also FAB-2585.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Description:*  Rollback ledger to a certain block on one channel while traffic is running in the network, and do peer node reset  *Steps:* # Launch a fabric network with 2 orderers(1 ordererorg) and 2 peers(1 org) # Create 1 channel, join peer to channel, install and instantiate chaincode and start sending the traffic # Takedown the peer2 when the block count reached to 1000 while traffic is running # Launch fabric tools container with peer node rollback -c <channel name> -b 500 # After rolling back to 500 blocks, delete the fabric-tools pod and re-launch the peer2 # While peer is catching up the blocks, delete the peer2 again and launch the fabric tools container with peer node reset command # It will reset to the genesis block by removing all the blocks in the peer2 ledger # Delete the fabric-tools pod and relaunch the network  *Observations:* # When peer node rollback is executed, it will roll back to 500 blocks and catches up, when peer2 is restarted. # When peer node reset is executed, it will reset the entire ledger and starts pulling the blocks from 1 when it ipeer2 is restarted  ></description> </Issue>

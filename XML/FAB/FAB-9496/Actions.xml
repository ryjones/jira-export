<Action id="43463" issue="29370" author="grapebaba" type="comment" body=" ~xixuejia I think we should define own metrics interface in fabric, tally is just current default implementation.  In further we may use other implementation even customize and no change in caller code. That is why I just implement count and gauge methods,  for timer and histogram methods we also need consider more general. Indeed current interfaces derived from tally, however it is enough general right now." created="2018-04-26 11:53:59.0" updateauthor="grapebaba" updated="2018-04-26 12:15:07.0"/>

CDATA Thanks  ~grapebaba  for sharing your thoughts. I do see generalizing interfaces is good, but I don't see much value to repeat tally's interfaces/implementations given you have chose tally and it already generalizes very common metrics interfaces. This should be very similar to  flogging|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/common/flogging  package which provides logging.Logger object for other packages to do logging.  Would you please share your thought about why not reusing tally's Timer and Histogram, are they not general enough?  ></body> </Action>

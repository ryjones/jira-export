CDATA This is a test scenario using fabric-test Operator + PTE, in k8s cluster: * k8s samplecc_50MB_TXs; refer to existing testcase in k8s automation suite * Use Operator to launch a small network (minimum 3 orderers, 2 orgs and 2 peers per org), preferably in k8s cluster * Configure using raft, couchdb, 1 channel, samplecc golang cc * Use PTE to execute a few invokes with 25 MB payloads (resulting in 50 MB sized transactions). Calculate TPS and confirm all transactions are successful. There should be no panics and no error logs observed.  ></description> </Issue>

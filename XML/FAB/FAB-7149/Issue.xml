CDATA Create a cron job to trigger fabric-smoke-test CI job. This job has to run for every 4 hours irrespective of the changes merged in fabric repository.  Existing  fabric-smoke-tests-verify-x86_64|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-smoke-tests-verify-x86_64/  and   fabric-smoke-tests-verify-x86_64|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-smoke-tests-verify-x86_64/  jobs have been disabled and make it work as cron job. That means, we don't trigger these jobs for every patch set but to make sure smoke tests are working as expected on fabric changes.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, certificates of intermediate CAs are sanitized in the same way root CA certificates are (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/msp/mspimpl.go#L845). Namely, by using as parent certificate the certificate itself. But intermediate CA certificates must have a parent and therefore the sanitation must happen with the respect to that certificate.

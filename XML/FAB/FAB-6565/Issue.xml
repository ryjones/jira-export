CDATA The design right now is to register for BLOCK or FILTEREDBLOCK for the peer eventing service.  You can do both but from the SDKs perspective this is not really a valid use case.   Depending on ACLs the user may not have right to get BLOCK so it could be rejected.  This requires the SDK to either try the other which is a waste or have the USER via out of bounds information know what type they have access to.   I think the SDK should have a Interest BLOCKORFILTEREDBLOCK which the PEER would deliver BLOCK events if that was allowed and if not would deliver FILTEREDBLOCK events.  ></description> </Issue>

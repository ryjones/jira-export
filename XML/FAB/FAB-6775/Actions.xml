Clients should only register for events from peer&apos;s that they trust, making the peer signature unnecessary and also a performance issue.Â " created="2017-10-30 17:04:18.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2017-10-30 17:04:18.0"/>
<Action id="33603" issue="22861" author="ales" type="comment" body="It&apos;s paramount that we document this assumption, namely, that clients must only get events from peers they fully trust. I can see scenarios in which this is not true, e.g. a client who is *not* a reader of a channel and yet needs to know when certain events take place so that it can take some appropriate action. Adding signatures might be useful in that case because then the client can hold the peer accountable in case of bogus actions being returned by the peer to the client." created="2017-10-31 09:31:20.0" updateauthor="ales" updated="2017-10-31 09:31:20.0"/>

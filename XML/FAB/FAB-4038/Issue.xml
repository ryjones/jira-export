CDATA This system testcase is a Performance Benchmark test, for sample_cc chaincode written in nodeJS. (Compare to similar test FAB-3808 for sample_cc chaincode written in GO.) This test is executed by fabric-test/tools/PTE/CITest/scripts/test_driver.sh * Component: Performance Stress Test with LevelDB * Description: Send 10000 invoke transactions concurrently to 1 peer in both orgs, calculate tps, remove network and cleanup. * Artifact Locations: fabric-test/tools/PTE/CITest/FAB-4038-2q-LevelDB-nodeJS * Network Topology: 3 Ord, 4 KB, 3 ZK, 2 Org, 2 Peers/Org, 1 Chan, sample_cc, 2 thrds * Launch network, use PTE in STRESS mode to continuously. * Client Driver: test_pte.py, PTE  TPS can be measured by manual inspection but currently does not influence the pass/failure result. In future we may enhance the PTE tool to automatically determine the TPS, at which time we could modify the assertion in the CI testcase in systest_pte.py to ensure the TPS is not lower than an acceptable value.   ></description> </Issue>

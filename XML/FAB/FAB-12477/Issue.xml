CDATA Currently, there is no representation which could be used to keep information about mapping from consenters to theirs ids. As per Figure.6 of the  Raft design doc|https://docs.google.com/document/d/138Brlx2BiYJm5bzFk_B0csuEUKYdXXr7Za9V7C76dwo/edit#  we need to introduce  new message which will hold mapping of consenters id, which later need to be stored within block metadata.  Suggested message would look like:  {code} // Maps of the Raft consenters membership to // cluster node ids to be stored in block metadata message ConsentersMembership { map<uint64, Consenter> consenters = 1; uint64 nextConsenterID = 2; } {code}  the {{nextConsenterID}} field needed as we need to maintain and keep track of next consenters id to be assigned to new coming Raft replica  ></description> </Issue>

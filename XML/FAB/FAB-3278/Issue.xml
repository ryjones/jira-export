CDATA right now the SDK builds always build fabric images from scratch, which on average takes >40min or so, which the SDK tests themselves take only 3-5min. can this be streamlined such that the fabric merge builds publishes to a private docker registry and for the SDK builds to pull from there? it'll speed up the builds dramatically  fabric-baseimage and fabric-baseos rarely changes so they should be built into the worker VMs to speed up the docker pull even further  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We can implement this by pushing images to nexus repository or private docker hub account. If we implement this we can reduce 20-30 mins build time. I see below concerns   1) We don't publish images for every merge commit in current CI process. Based on the e2e test result, CRON job push images to private docker hub account from sandbox environment. Instead of private repository we can publish nexus3..  2) If we don't publish images for every commit, how fabric-sdk-node know which commit image it has to pick? Do we need to update docker-compose file every time to fetch docker image using snapshot tag.   ~jimthematrix  will discuss this  ></body> </Action>

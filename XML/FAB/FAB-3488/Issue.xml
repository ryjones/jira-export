CDATA The documentation is now published on readthedocs and involves a build process which is not currently documented anywhere. This makes it difficult for anyone new to the project to contribute without "bugging" one of the few people in the know. Furthermore the documentation relies on several principles that one should know about so that any change to the doc is made in a consistent manner. These principles also ought to be documented somewhere.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In core.yaml for v1.1.0-alpha,      {code} # The endpoint this peer uses to listen for inbound chaincode connections.  # If this is commented-out, the listen address is selected to be  # the peer's address (see below) with port 7052  # chaincodeListenAddress: 0.0.0.0:7052     # The endpoint the chaincode for this peer uses to connect to the peer.  # If this is not specified, the chaincodeListenAddress address is selected.  # And if chaincodeListenAddress is not specified, address is selected from  # peer listenAddress. # chaincodeAddress: 0.0.0.0:7052  {code}     The chaincodeListenAddress defaults to the peerAddress, and the chaincodeAddress defaults to peerListenAddress. Instead, I think chaincodeListenAddress should default to peerListenAddress and chaincodeAddress should default to peerAddress.     ></description> </Issue>

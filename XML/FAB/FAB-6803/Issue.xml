CDATA The viper pkg currently vendor'd in Fabric does not work well with key name with dots. When such key is assembled into a path, dot serves as delimiter, and leads to 1-level-deeper, incorrect searching path, e.g. {{foo.bar.v1.1}} would search for: {code} foo: bar: v1: 1: {code} instead of {code} foo: bar: v1.1: {code} Latest viper addresses this issue by checking if {{v1.1}} already exists at shallower level.  I see two options here: - Upgrade Viper pro: fundamentally solving the problem con: new viper stores keys in lowercases. Some modifications needed to accommodate it, e.g. using {{twoorgsgenesis}} instead of {{TwoOrgsGenesis}} when specifying profile. - Use {{V1_1}} instead of {{V1.1}} as key pro: simple to fix con: some other side effects?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Chaincode validation currently works by looking up the endorsement policy for a chaincode as defined by the LSCC.  Instead, this validation needs to look up the current endorsement policy by the reference as defined by the peer resource config structure.  In the future, more pieces of validation may occur here, so it would be peferable for the code to retrieve a full copy of the configuration and use this as a parameter to the validatoin.  Note, especially for replaying the chain, being able to pass the correct validation context is crucial, so some of the peer internal APIs may need to be modified to accommodate this.  ></description> </Issue>

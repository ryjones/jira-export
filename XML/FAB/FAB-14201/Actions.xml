CDATA Putting this back on the backlog for now.  ~rameshthoomu  made good progress but we have higher priority items to address right now and it's still not quite there.  When we come back to this, we should reference the CRs listed above and restore them as appropriate.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Is this supposed to go into core fabric repo or the fabric-go-libs repo?  Where are the images going to be stored? Who is going to push it up? When is the image going to be pulled down?  Is this going to be a scheduled chore to periodically update the version of all the tools?  If it's a bunch of different tools all together, then does it have some external version we'll use? I don't see much use for any real version number besides the date, as we'll have to put some kind of manifest inside to know what version of each we have installed.  Â   This will also make the build very reliant explicitly on docker when a lot of these can be run as native tools.  Alternatives # Each tool should be compiled and stored as an artifact in the nexus and pulled down at the start of the build # Whatever build environment jenkins provides should have the tools set up out of band and updated on a schedule, since the version of golang used is also provided this way.  ></body> </Action>

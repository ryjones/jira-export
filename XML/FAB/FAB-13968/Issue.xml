CDATA Add new version of chaincode to peers, define channel using old version  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel  And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000  When an admin builds chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd" as version "2" with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  with name "mycc2" on all peers And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers  # Note the approval below is for the originally installed chaincode # Simulates the installation of an upgrade, but no one wants to use it #    at this time.  When the organization admins approve the upgraded to version "0" chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the version "0" chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

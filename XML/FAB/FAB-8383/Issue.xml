CDATA Kafka is updated to version 1.0.0 as of baseimage 0.4.6.   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/kafka.html  mentions that Kafka version is 0.10.2.1.  Remembering to keep the version in this doc topic up to date is not going to be practical.  I'd suggest reword in such a way that the version number does not need to be provided here.  The version number is still available in the upgrade doc topic, and we'll likely add it to an overall 'version dependencies' release doc page in the future.  ></description> </Issue>

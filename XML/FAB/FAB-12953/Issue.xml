CDATA We want the grpc logging interceptors to log at the completion of a request but I'm finding that we have a lot of code that does not properly shutdown and terminate streaming calls before just disappearing.  When a client disappears, the context associated with the client is canceled and the logging interceptors report it with a full stack trace. While the error is okay, the stack trace is simply too verbose.  ></description> </Issue>

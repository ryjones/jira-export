CDATA Problem:  A local MSP cannot retrieve CRLs stored locally to setup its configuration with. Given that the only way of updating an MSP is manual, and CRLs are part of the MSP configuration components, it is important that we enable the configuration also of this component.  Fix: Add a folder in configsample, called "CRLs" where a list of flies are included each a marshalled version of X.509 CRLs, and have msp configuration go through this.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently in order to use NodeJS chaincode, the client need to pass the chaincodeType to install and instantiate.  I don't think it is optimal to ask the user to pass it in both calls... (user could possibly say NodeJS during install and during instantiate he could pass golang, by accident and there is not a lot of ways we can tell the user that this is not right)     Ideally, we could get the chaincode type during install...and use that same type during instantiate without requiring user to pass the type during instantiate.  ></description> </Issue>

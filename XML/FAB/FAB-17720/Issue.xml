CDATA One thing I know we're missing is checking that intermediate certs are signed by one of the root certs.   ---------------------- April 14 update: looked into the msp code to see how it's handling cert validation. We already knew it doesn't care about expiration of certificates but hadn't fully investigated the actual implementation. It's using  these options|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/msp/mspimplvalidate.go#L273-L287   and then calling cert.Verify() to  check for a unique validation chain|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/msp/mspimpl.go#L720-L738 . We should try to incorporate these details into the library instead of our very basic CheckSignatureFrom check.   ></description> </Issue>

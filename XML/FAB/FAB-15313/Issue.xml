CDATA Comments regarding the assertions in {{TestSelectClusterBootBlock}} need to be addressed.  Gerrit has the details but here are the comments:  {quote} I think you either want to use assert.Same(t, bootstrapBlock, clusterBlock) so ensure you're getting back the exact same instance (ptr value) or just use assert.Equal(t, bootstrapBlock, clusterBoot) to ensure that the values pointed to are equal. The header number assertion is implied with the equality check.  Unrelated but for awareness (you may already know) - if proto objects get marshaled/unmarshaled, assert.Equals won't necessarily work and you'll have to use proto.Equal to check the values. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

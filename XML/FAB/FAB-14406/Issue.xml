If a peer is dishonest, they may run arbitrary code, and if the peer is honest, then they will be running the correct code in any event.  It really only prevents accidental mis-matches of code packages across the network, which should also be caught by endorsement policy checking." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2019-02-28 04:36:51.0" updated="2019-04-04 13:53:12.0" resolutiondate="2019-04-04 13:53:12.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="49692"/>

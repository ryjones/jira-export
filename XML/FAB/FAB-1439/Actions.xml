CDATA *scenarios for Component : fabric-endorser* FAB-181: Deploy a chaincode to a Peer and make it an Endorser for the chaincode  FAB-182: Deploy a chaincode to a Peer along with name of the custom ESCC and VSCC and make it an Endorser for the chaincode  (FAB-314: Add ESCC and VSCC support to endorse BDD)  FAB-183 : As an authorized user, I want to upgrade chaincode  FAB-799 : Concurrent chaincode execution  (few scenarios  a. Deploy multiple chaincodes and send transactions concurrent to each chaincode  b. Invoke concurrent transactions on a single chaincode - This might not work as expected, but need to see what can be done here)  FAB-1022: Call gossip when a peer join channel  FAB-1025 : Query configuration block of a chain  FAB-497: Create system chaincode at the peer to handle configuration changes  FAB-1297: add tests to excercise multichain in chaincode framework  FAB-756:  Endorser GRPC API (Is this valid for BDD?)  FAB-23: As an application developer, I want to provide friendly name to identify a chain code, so I can more easily manage and debug chain code.  FAB-434: As a Committer I want to get a batch and turn it into a Block  FAB-781: An endorser peer endorses a transaction against a certain chain according to the chain ID provided in the protocol  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Following is the documented approach for data persistence   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html#a-note-on-data-persistence   Couch DB fails to stand-up when the above method is followed on Host Machine running on Ubuntu 14.04 and RHELv7.2  This was discussed with  ~mastersingh24  on RC and it was noticed the folder created by the docker doesn't have required permission and hence the problem at the time of writing by couch db.  Creating a folder and assigning o+w  permission and then running couch db with above steps - works well. But this is not going to be well accepted by Security.  Gari mentioned on working on a fix so this issue is resolved. Creating a JIRA for tracking purpose.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The chaincode definition in the new lifecycle requires:  an admin of an organization to define the chaincode for peers in the organization an admin of a channel to invoke an endorsement on the lifecycle chaincode in order to collect the "votes" of step (1) and then send a transaction with these signatures (of the admins of all organization).   Step (2) is governed by an endorsement policy that is a meta-policy, which can be either a signature policy, or a quantifier predicate of meta-policies such as - all, any, or majority.  If we expand service discovery to support meta-policies, we can have SDKs know the peers to send endorsements for step (2) via discovery endorsement queries.  ></description> </Issue>

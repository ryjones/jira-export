CDATA While Kafka has no straightforward way to figure out which version you are using, I don't think that it is our responsibility to document how to figure out your Kafka version. From Fabric's point of view, it's an external dependency. In my view, it's like documenting "What operating system are you using?".   That said, I can see that for users that don't care what version of Kafka they are using and are just simply using our sample Kafka images we can remind them which version of Kafka was in our sample images. I will add a note in the upgrade doc documenting which Kafka version was bundled in 1.0.x sample images. ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/17551/ ) ---- To actually figure out which Kafka version you are using: * Ask your Kafka provider to tell you. * Search the Kafka broker's log for {{INFO Kafka version}}. * Examine the names of the jars files in Kafka's {{bin}} directory.     ></body> </Action>

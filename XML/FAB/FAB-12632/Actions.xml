CDATA This is not a bug. line of code - "p.waitGrp.Done()" is without defer by design. The main motivation to keep it so is to do the actual job of loading the expiring keys in the background - not in the caller routine (which happens to be the 'commit' routine).  However, at the same time, we want to make sure in the caller routing that the background job is indeed launched. This is because, before the next 'commit', we check for the completion of this background job and we may get a false positive (because perhaps, it was not yet launched)...

CDATA This is an E2E that assumes two identity mixer MSPs for clients in addition to the standard E2E test configuration that we have in place (e.g., 3 orgs of 2 peers each).  The genesis block specifies that to enhance the list of MSPs in the chain, a policy needs to be satisfied that allows solely anonymous identities. E.g.,   (Combine(OrgI1.member AND Orgl1.anonymous)) AND (Combine(OrgI2.member AND OrgI2.anonymous)), where OrgI1, and OrgI2 the identity mixer MSPs.  Let Org3, 4, and 5 the non-identity mixer MSPs. This e2e requests three reconfiguration requests coming from clients leveraging the following MSPs.   - OrgI1 and OrgI2 clients send a reconfiguration request to add a new MSP -> this request should pass   - OrgI1 and Org3 clients send a reconfiguration request to add a new MSP -> this request should fail   - Org3 and Org4 clients send a reconfiguration request to add a new MSP -> this request should fail     ></description> </Issue>

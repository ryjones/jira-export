CDATA Some cruft has been accumulated over time on the orderer-related Docker Compose configurations under the "bddtests" folder. This changeset: # Removes environment variables that are either deprecated (e.g. `ORDERER_RAMLEDGER`) or not in use by the BDD tests (e.g. all `CONFIGTX` variables since `bootstrap.feature` does not use the `configtxgen` tool, or the `provisional` bootstrapper). # Removes configurations that are either no longer relevant (e.g. `bdd-docker/docker-compose-4-consensus-batch-nosnapshotbuffer.yml`) or no longer in use. # Moves all Docker Compose files to the `bddtests` folder and renames them to filenames that are hopefully a bit more expressive. Thanks to Jeff Garratt for guiding me through his. # Modified the Kafka environment so that it uses the bare-minimum sensisble defaults, and added comments for the critical settings.  ></description> </Issue>

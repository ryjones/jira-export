CDATA   ~C0rWin  ~denyeart  I would like to take this. Here's a few questions to be confirmed 1. Do we also need to change the package name rawledger to ordererledger in orderer directory to make it consistent? 2. Similar to question 1, I suppose we should change the names in related docs, right? 3. According to the latest NCAP(commiteId: a692f93), the ledger names should be changed to OrdererLedger on orderer and PeerLedger on peer. Which terminology should I use for the Ledger on Peer?   ></body> </Action>

Yes, these package names should also be updated. 2. Which docs do you refer to?  For external purpose we can simply call the CommitterLedger/PeerLedger the 'Ledger', since this is the main ledger people think about in blockchain.   3. Yes, you can use the terms OrdererLedger and PeerLedger in the code, in order to be consistent with NCAP document.  Thanks for working on this one.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~denyeart , I think it would be better to change the orderer package names in another commit to lower the merge conflict. Your idea?  Please review the code-> https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3575/  ></body> </Action>

Sounds like you will have one more update to the commit, I&apos;ll do full review after your next push." created="2017-01-04 13:33:37.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2017-01-04 13:33:37.0"/>

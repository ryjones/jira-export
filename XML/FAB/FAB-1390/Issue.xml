CDATA As was suggested by  ~denyeart  in CR (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3259/) related to FAB-1384  {quote} The other thing I wanted to mention, is that with this changeset, the committer's ledger is no longer a 'ValidatedLedger' (invalid tx removed). Rather it is now a raw ledger (with invalid tx marked). Therefore instead of keeping the names RawLedger and ValidatedLedger in ledger_interface.go, I think the more accurate names would now be OrdererLedger and CommitterLedger, respectively. These names would be more expressive for their intended use. Let's see if Manish agrees. {quote}  and according to  ~manish-sethi   {quote} Yes, I'm fine with the new names proposed by Dave. But, I think that we can change that later in a separate commit - in order to keep the  conflicts with the refactoring to low. {quote}  Creating new story to follow up on that and eventually refactor interfaces names.  ></description> </Issue>

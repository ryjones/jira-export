CDATA Commands such as `peer channel list` will fail with a `context deadline exceeded` when peer address is set to the Kubernetes service (e.g. `peer-hlf-peer:7051`) that points to the peer pod. Other services (e.g. Peer communicating with Orderer service work fine)  All this works correctly as expected on a normal Kubernetes environment.  Initially I assumed the issue was with Minikube's DNS (either kube DNS or Core DNS both failed), but now suspect something is wrong with how the peer interacts with the Minikube service discovery.  ></description> </Issue>

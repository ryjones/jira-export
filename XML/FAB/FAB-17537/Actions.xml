<Action id="69630" issue="44418" author="btl5037" type="comment" body=" ~shitaibin , sorry, I missed your previous comment. Can you ping me on RocketChat sometime this week and we can discuss it. I&apos;d love to see someone from the community work on this. This has been superseded by a different Jira which is encompassing a major rewrite I am actively working on, but I&apos;d be more than happy to let someone pick up that part of it." created="2020-07-06 02:34:14.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2020-07-06 02:34:14.0"/>

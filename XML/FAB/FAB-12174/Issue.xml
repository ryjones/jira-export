CDATA *TLDR* - Make all fabric samples that use SDK, use service discovery and *remove static configuration of peers/chaincodes/orderers from connection profile*.  Since v1.2 - Fabric peers can tell the SDK information regarding the existing peers in the channel, or which peers should be used to endorse a given chaincode.  Despite the fact that the node SDK can leverage this ability, the fabric samples aren't configured to take advantage of this,  and all peers are configured statically in the channel, and the chaincodes are also configured statically|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.2/balance-transfer/artifacts/network-config.yaml#L49-L94 .  This leads to miseducation and misinformation as this isn't the optimal way of configuring the network.  Therefore we should:  * Completely remove all configuration of chaincodes from the network profile configuration of all samples that use SDKs. * Completely remove all configuration of peers and orderers by channels from the network profile configuration of all samples that use SDKs. * Configure the network profile of all samples that use SDKs to use *a single peer* and rely on service discovery.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *AFTER V1.4.0 ONLY... NOT AFTER V1.4.0-RC1.*  After creating release-1.4 branch, pin the fabric samples to use version "~1.4.0" of node sdk and node chaincode.  This will forever align fabric samples in release-1.4 branch with the 1.4.x node.js releases.   fabric-samples master branch continues to use "unstable" to pick up the latest and greatest node.js releases.  This should be merged in release-1.4 branch, before fabric-samples is tagged with "v1.4.0".     *Clarification - for v1.4.0-rc1 node sdk had a release, therefore we pinned at "1.4.0-rc1" until final release.*  ></description> </Issue>

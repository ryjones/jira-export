CDATA When I deployed Fabric Blockchains over Kubernetes, there was  problem which continuously persisted that, after the peers has joined the channel on Kubernetes, the next was to create a chaincode container which will carry out the transactions. Now, we can't control this chaincode container creation, and it will be created over docker itself.   So, what I want to suggest is, whatif we could control this part of Blockchain deployment, and provide a choice to deploy a chaincode POD in Kubernetes other than chaincode container in Docker. With this feature, the dependency to share docker endpoints with Kubernetes Peer Pods will be diminished.   ></description> </Issue>

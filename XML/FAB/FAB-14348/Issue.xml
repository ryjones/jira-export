CDATA Each integration test suite starts by building the binaries for each of the fabric components. As the binaries are used, the path to the built artifact is used to generate the command.  This works pretty well but is somewhat wasteful when we run suites that don't need one or more of the binaries (eg. token) or when we are skipping the execution of a suite with the focus or skip options on ginkgo as those options still execute BeforeSuite.  One option is to add serialized build logic to each of the accessors on nwo.Components to lazily build the binaries. This should remove the need to explicitly call Build from each suite.  We can then decide if we want to leave build (enable explicit calls) or remove the function entirely.  ></description> </Issue>

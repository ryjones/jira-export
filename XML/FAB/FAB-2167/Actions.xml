CDATA This is a big usability issue (the peer CLI interface is something that is used a lot and should have a good look and instructions).   Going to leave this as 1.0 but going to bump up the priority as this is something that'll stick out badly.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~guoger  I don't see why not. CLI is at the user level and easier for a beginner to the fabric to start to dig into it.  Also, some more information ...  ~greg.haskins  introduced https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin to handle command line for cryptogen https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8269 ... and I believe the long time goal was to use that to clean up peer CLI as well.  I wonder  if this CR of cleaning up help can be a part of that.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~muralisr  hi, sorry for the delay, I just posted a review here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10463/ I refactored command implementation so flags could be categorized more easily and we need lesser code adding new flag. Essentially it's changed to use a map to maintain a list of flags, which could be assigned to specific sub-commands. So when adding new flag, we could just add that flag to the map, and refer to it using flag name as key at individual command impl. Otherwise, we need to duplicate code for every single one of commands using the flag.  I'm working on other parts of commands now, let me know what you think.  Yes we could do it post 1.0 if you think appropriate, although remaining work should be straightforward, as long as you agree with this approach. thx!  ></body> </Action>

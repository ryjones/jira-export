CDATA The current structure of the configtx.yaml references anchors before they are defined while the spec states that anchors need to be defined before they are aliased.  Old versions of our yaml parser had a bug where it did not properly implement aliasing when an anchor was redefined. (It was supposed to use the most recent preceding node having the aliased anchor but used the last.) This bug has been fixed.  While we should update to newer versions of the yaml parser to pick up bug fixes and features, we are unable to do that at this time as our existing configtx.yaml files fail to parse.  This can be addressed in the current code by reordering the stanzas in the file. Unfortunately, this will not fix existing configtx documents that are being used in the wild.  /cc  ~mastersingh24   ></description> </Issue>

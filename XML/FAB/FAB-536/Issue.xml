CDATA The test automation tools should be modified such that we can change the SDK used as a parameter and without code changes. This will allow us to know if there are any issues more quickly between the different SDKs and find those holes more quickly.   This can also come in handy when working with customers to know which SDKs they are using and possible issues that may be present as a result.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In short, FAB-2162 configures the provisional bootstrapper via the `genesis.yaml` file and the `CONFIGTX_` ENV var prefix.  Before that, the bootstrapper would be set via the `orderer.yaml` file and the `ORDERER_` ENV var prefix.  The Kafka-related Docker environments set the orderer type via the ORDERER_ ENV var prefix and were not updated accordingly.  As a result, post FAB-2162, anyone bringing up any of the ordererXkafkaY networks was actually bringing up Y Kafka brokers without reason -- they were still running solo.  This changeset fixes this.  ></description> </Issue>

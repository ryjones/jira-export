CDATA Fabric operators need some minimal visibility into chaincode execution information, without turning on full peer debug.  Message should include context information such as channel and txid, as well as execution time.  For example log statements such as: {code:java} 2018-10-04 08:35:47.055 EDT  endorser  SimulateProposal -> INFO 033  myc  b762a22d  Entry chaincode: marbles 2018-10-04 08:35:47.060 EDT  endorser  SimulateProposal -> INFO 034  myc  b762a22d  Exit chaincode: marbles (5ms){code}  ></description> </Issue>

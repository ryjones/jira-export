CDATA I tried out the ledger troubleshooting utility with one piece of data different between snapshots (the appraisedValue field).  The utility correctly identified that one record was different: {code:java} Successfully compared snapshots. Result saved to ./result.json. Total differences found: 1{code} However, when I look at the result.json, it has the correct records differences identified, but for the transaction height, it only includes the blockNum, not the txNum: {code:java}   { "namespace":"basic", "key":"1", "snapshotrecord1":{ "value":"{\"ID\":\"1\",\"color\":\"blue\",\"size\":35,\"owner\":\"tom\",\"appraisedValue\":1000}", "blockNum":4 }, "snapshotrecord2":{ "value":"{\"ID\":\"1\",\"color\":\"blue\",\"size\":35,\"owner\":\"tom\",\"appraisedValue\":1001}", "blockNum":4 } }  {code} The txNum is getting lost somewhere.  ></description> </Issue>

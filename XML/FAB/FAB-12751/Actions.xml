<Action id="53105" issue="35146" author="scottz" type="comment" body="runPTE is not designed to be a complete interface with all options to do anything with any network. It is simply an easy way to run existing testcases quickly against any network. To send transactions to specific peers, you need to run a testcase that already does what you want (and we could investigate adding more TCs to the supported list), or maybe use a testcase that sends transactions to all peers and requires endorsement from all of them (although I don&apos;t think we have an existing testcase that does this yet). Since the user cannot even specify their own peer names individually, I don&apos;t think we could satisfy this reqest easily; the control that you are requesting, and similar controls, requires us to step back and consider the architecture of what we are doing with this tool, and consider if there are other ways to do that." created="2018-11-06 22:41:12.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-11-06 22:41:12.0"/>

CDATA Current runPTE.sh supports target peer option including: OrgAnchor, AllAnchors, OrgPeers, AllPeers.  You can see PTE README for the details of each option.  AllPeers option will send transaction to all peers included in the SC File.  Does this meet your need?  ></body> </Action>

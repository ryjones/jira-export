CDATA The intention was to add a sample separate from BYFN, not add to it. That is, put it in different folder altogether. The implementation borrowed heavily from BYFN, though.  However, adding samples (of any kind) seems to be low priority, so this task can be closed or split out of this story, in my opinion.  ></body> </Action>

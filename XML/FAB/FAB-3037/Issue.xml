CDATA The fabric/examples/event/block-listener/README seems to compile in v1.0, but the README was not updated from v0.6 to v1.0.   It should describe how it was implemented and how it can be used. Describe the available types or classes of events (could one monitor all failures on a channel? without knowing each transaction?), and when and where they are raised (orderer? peer? which components?). Does fabric guarantee an event for every proposal received? every proposal not Nacked? every acknowledged transaction? every transaction delivered to peer?  And we could use an overview description somewhere in the project documentation fabric/docs/source/.  If we don't know, or if these operational capabilities are not available, then we can create other jira issues to add them.  ></description> </Issue>

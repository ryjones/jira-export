CDATA At new chain setup time, a peer is requested to parse a JoinChannel request that contains a chain genesis block. The peer then needs to process this genesis block, and use configuration items listed within it to setup the security context of that chain: - the MSPManager of the chain consisting of the VerifierMSPs of all the organizations of the chain - the chain readers/writers and admins of the chain to enforce chain access control  In this work item we require that this enablement is achieved with the use of Configuration Manager (work that  ~jyellick  has been working on).  ></description> </Issue>

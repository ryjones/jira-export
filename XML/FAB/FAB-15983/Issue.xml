CDATA Refer to Item 40 of tab "Behave Testcases" in shared google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741  Refer also to FAB-15982. For this testcase, we want to do something similar. We must configure the network to specify one leader and one non-leader in each org; that is, we will NOT use peer gossip leader election. The only difference here is that we must disconnect (not stop) the leader peer (likely peer0) of one organization. Leave the other 3 peers running, and send transactions to one of the peers in the other org. After 15 secs, reconnect it, and confirm it rejoins successfully; it should resume as leader and catch up its ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

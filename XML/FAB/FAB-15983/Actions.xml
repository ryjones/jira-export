CDATA We decided not to do the "disconnect" scenarios like this one; these "msg-delivery-blocked/delayed" tests are not critical; most of the usecase scenarios are hit by other testcases already with stops and starts.   Additional note: system test team has done (and MAY automate) some tests by inserting message delivery delays to/from selected peers or orderers.  ></body> </Action>

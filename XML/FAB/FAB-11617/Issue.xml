CDATA Run the PTE SVT daily test suite,  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-pte-master-x86_64/,  which includes some performance tests, in IKS cluster instead of in LF machine pool. The latter provides wildly fluctuating TPS test results over several days, and also produces intermittent test failures due to resource contention issues. Referring to the attachment "CI vs IKS", after running some tests for 5 days on both environments, it seems clear that a dedicated IKS cluster is more stable with less variability in the TPS results. There may be additional factors influencing the test results even in the IKS cluster, since it does not give perfectly consistent results, which we can troubleshoot further as we strive for more stable consistent performance test results.  We may wish to consider in future to move other jobs as well to the IKS environment, especially performance tests.  This story involves several tasks, such as: setting up a dedicated IKS cluster solely for this purpose, sharing the kubeconfig with the job, altering the job to use the IKS cluster instead of allocation a VM from LF pool, running the PTE tests using ATD in the network (instead of PTE running NL itself for each testcase), and possibly modifying testcases to run in the new environment.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA # The core/ledger folder depth is high which creates difficulties in code traversal and code reading for beginners. In the long run, having a deeper folder depth is going to create some hurdles whenever we add new features. Moreover, we know that we can do better than this and that is a good enough motivation for doing this refactoring. # There are many packages. It is difficult to keep in mind what a package does. If the package name can give a brief summary of the task performed in that package, it would definitely improve the readability.  Please refer to the sub-tasks for more details.  ></description> </Issue>

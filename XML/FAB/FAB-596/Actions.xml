<Action id="19130" issue="12898" author="bcbrock" type="comment" body="busywork (fabric/tools/busywork) could be used to partially address this issue. I have not pushed for this in the past due to inherent unreliability of the fabric, e.g., busywork tests do not pass in the Vagrant VM because the fabric consistently and silently drops transactions in this resource-constrained environment. However if the node(s) running the benchmarks are beefy enough you should be able to push the fabric to the limits of its (correct) performance with busywork." created="2016-10-05 16:42:26.0" updateauthor="bcbrock" updated="2016-10-05 16:42:26.0"/>

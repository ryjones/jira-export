CDATA As part of the upgrade task (FAB-183) we need to check if the version of the chaincode matches the version in LSCC for the transaction. To this end every endorsed proposal response shoud contain the version of the chaincode.  Note that we could have used the Version field in the ChaincodeID in the Proposal and insisted user sets that version. Given we only support the "latest" version, the current model of user needs to only set the chaincode name. Requiring a version in proposal reeks of implementation leakage.  ></description> </Issue>

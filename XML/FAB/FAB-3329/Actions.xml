CDATA  ~muralisr  Please elaborate on this issue. Are we saying that the proposal shouldn't require the cc version? And that we should use the latest version from LSCC bc we only support 1 version at a time per channel?  If so, this is code clean up, or you could say usability bug.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~binhn  this is part of the upgrade work (or bug as it blocks the FAB-198 which is a bug). As mentioned in FAB-198, the endorser will set chaincode version and the committer will validate the version in the proposal response against the version in LSCC for the chaincode for the channel.  The Proposal already has a ChaincodeID so we *could* just have a Version field in the ProposalResponse's ChaincodeAction. However we use ChaincodeID as it contains more information and can be used for other purposes in future (we may have a ChaincodeAction for each CC-2-CC call in the request).   Also moved this to a Bug as its a task for bug FAB-198  ></body> </Action>

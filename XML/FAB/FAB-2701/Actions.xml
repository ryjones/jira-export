CDATA  ~kim@letkeman.net   ~denyeart  yes, we should expose the timestamp to the chaincode. The {{Tx}} in the {{GetTxTimestamp}} makes it clear we are referring to the Proposal timestamp (Proposal.Header.ChannelHeader.Timestamp field).  If/when we expose a timestamp exposed by the system, we could create a new {{GetSystemTimestamp}} API.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="21477" issue="15269" author="kletkeman" type="comment" body="Yes, the tx timestamp has been used by our chaincode ever since Binh put the function into the stub. But in v1, the changes in protocol caused someone to toss that code, although the stub interface stayed. The proposal timestamp is presumably going to be used for all copies of the transaction in the chain, so it is perfect for this use case." created="2017-03-12 21:18:55.0" updateauthor="kletkeman" updated="2017-03-12 21:18:55.0"/>

CDATA we must NOT resubmit it if we still have v1.0.x orderer in the cluster, as they couldn't differentiate the resubmission and original tx. Therefore, we should add a switch {{Compatibility.Resubmission}} to turn on/off resubmission. Upgrade path should be: - Partial OSNs are upgraded to v1.1, {{Resubmission}} is off be default - v1.1 OSNs behave exactly the same as v1.0.x (still double-validate every tx, and no resubmission) - Upgrade remaining v1.0.x OSNs to v1.1 - Re-configure the channel to turn on {{Resubmission}}  The switch {{Resubmission}} is added as part of {{channelconfig.Orderer}} interface and used in Kafka orderer. However, it's *hardcoded* to return {{false}} at the moment, and this story is to capture the remaining work, which is to have it return *real* value parsed.  ></description> </Issue>

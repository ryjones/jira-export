CDATA We will need some client we can use to drive a second workload against the CouchDB database.  This client should run continuous JSON queries on the CouchDB endpoint with a filter on both field1 and field2. Filtering on both fields will ensure the queries are always hitting an index regardless of the which field or fields are currently indexed.  This client workload will be driven for the entire duration of the test.  ></description> </Issue>

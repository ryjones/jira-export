CDATA The RSCC config tree needs to be specified at channel creation and passed on the peers at Join time. This task is for implementing how the config transported on the channel configuration.  From  ~jyellick    {code:java} It is "transient" because it appears only in the _next_ config block. If the system is reconfigured, the data will not appear in the config due to the reconfiguration. IE, there is no need to keep the RSCC seed data around for the later config blocks, because it would be out of date, because it may be modified by normal endorser transactions {code}   ></description> </Issue>

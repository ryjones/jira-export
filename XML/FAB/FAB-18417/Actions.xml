CDATA Your problem is not with CORE_PEER_FILESYSTEMPATH, it is with CORE_LEDGER_SNAPSHOTS_ROOTDIR. This is a new snapshot directory added in v2.3.x that you need to override if you don't want to use default location of /var/hyperledger/production/snapshots.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-2.3/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L703   Let's use this issue to update docs to include mention of CORE_LEDGER_SNAPSHOTS_ROOTDIR everywhere CORE_PEER_FILESYSTEMPATH is mentioned.  ></body> </Action>

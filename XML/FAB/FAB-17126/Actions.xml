CDATA Labels cannot have spaces in them. Please use one of the acceptable symbols as noted by the error message: {code:java} .+-_{code}  edit: Ah, I see. We aren't doing any validation on the label when packaging. The error is only returned when attempting to install the package with the invalid label.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA -I'm not sure that we actually want to add this validation in the CLI. The peer returns the expected error while attempting to install the package with an invalid label. I don't see any similar validation logic in other CLI calls (beyond ensuring strings aren't empty).-  ~sykesm -, what do you think?-  Discussed with Matt. Since this step is purely local (no server interaction) we should perform the label validation in the CLI while packaging the chaincode.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A decision to be made:  etcd retains several (5 by default) stale wal/snap files, so that if the latest one is corrupted, it can read older ones.  Should we do the same?

(effectively with less height and need to catch up with other nodes) {quote}  pls chime in  ~yacovm   ~kchristidis   ></description> </Issue>

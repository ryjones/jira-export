CDATA Most of the time the caller code just wants to get access to the current user context for signing stuff, yet this call is currently asynchronous (returning a Promise) due to its support for edge cases where the calling code either wants to switch to a different user or is recovering from crashes.  To make the mainstream usage of this method more straightforward, change the implementation to return synchronously by default but can be made Promise-based if both a "name" and "checkPersistence" are passed in.  ></description> </Issue>

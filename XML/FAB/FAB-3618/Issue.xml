CDATA  ~binhn  in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3548 defines error codes in the 400-500 range to follow HTTP codes. Some examples from that * BadRequest = "400"  	// Invalid inputs on API calls * Forbidden = "403" // Forbidden due to access control issues * NotFound = "404" // Not Found (eg chaincode not found)  (there are more).  These would be useful for chaincode developers too. In all these cases we likely don't want to endorse and allow a transaction to be created by default. ie, extend non-endorsing errors to >= 400 (from >= 500).   We should have considered this earlier but need to fix this - if agreed to - before we 1.0.  Also noting that  ~sanchezl  did already make this point while doing Java CC implementation. Whatever we decide here we need to make sure Java CC maintains parity with GO CC.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The {{configtxgen}} tool has enhancements to print the org definition in JSON format to make editing channel configs easier.  It would also be helpful for it to print the value definition for policies defined in the global policy section as well.  A very similar syntax to the {{-printOrg}} could be used, simply naming a policy rather than an org name.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to use a fit-for-purpose library that can modify an existing channel configuration to remove an orderer endpoint from an orderer org's config group.  Acceptance: Starting with an existing Config block/transaction, I can call a function that removes an orderer endpoint from the configuration. After performing that operation, I can compute a ConfigUpdate transaction that is ready for a signature workflow. An appropriate example should also be added to the example test that demonstrates this behavior.  ></description> </Issue>

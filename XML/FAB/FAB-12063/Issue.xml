CDATA The Java Chaincode integration suite includes two tests where one appears to be a complete superset of the other. This unnecessarily elongates the execution time of the tests.  {quote} sykesm 1:56 PM Why do we need two java cc tests? Isn't the pvtdata test a superset of the other?  gennadyl 1:24 PM If you look this way - you are right. This is only historical - I wrote first test before private data for java shim was added and I needed test to check if the shim works. After that I added one for private data, to make sure shim works ok with private data. {quote}  The redundant test should be removed to shave several seconds off of the integration tests.  ></description> </Issue>

A subledger is a private ledger shared by a subset of network participants, often times just two trading partners in the network having their own subledger, and perhaps a regulator as a 3rd member of the private subledger.  In large networks, there could be thousands of subledgers that the regulator would be involved in, and therefore the regulator&apos;s CouchDB instance may have thousands of databases within it.  So we need to determine if this would cause problems on a single machine.  Basically, how much memory and other overhead is there per database.  Is it feasible to have thousands of databases?

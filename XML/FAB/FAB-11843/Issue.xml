CDATA I'd like to replace map and Mutex in MSP mgmt code with sync.map and RWMutex for better performance. sync.map is a thread-safe version of map, and become available from Go 1.9.   Originally this patch was included in the change for  FAB-11321  (MSP cache optimization), but the original patch includes code that are not directly related to MSP cache.  Based on a review comment in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/24797/4/msp/mgmt/mgmt.go I split the original patch into two parts, and this JIRA issue is about the remaining part.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are a few items that need to be done when branching fabric-test to v1.3. * update the PTE version in the following files (may be done before branching): ** tools/ATD/vars/1channel.yml (tag: "1.3.0") ** tools/ATD/vars/FAB12135.yml (tag: "1.3.0") * change .gitmodules ** add "branch = release-1.3" to each of the repos *minus* cello (until cello releases supporting versions) * change Makefile ** "git-latest" target needs to explicitly pull from the set branch ** fabric replace "master" with "release-1.3" ** ca replace "master" with "release-1.3" ** fabric-chaincode-java replace "master" with "release-1.3" ** (Once we are pulling images successfully for the test runs, we also need to ensure that pullDockerImages.sh pulls the correct images from dockerhub) * feature/package.json ** change "unstable" to "1.3.0" * tools/PTE/package.json ** change "unstable" to "1.3.0" * tools/PTE/README.md ** change "master" to "1.3.0" * tools/PTE/CITest/README.md ** change "master" to "1.3.0"  ></description> </Issue>

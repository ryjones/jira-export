CDATA Currently, peers do not forward membership information of peers that have no external endpoint to outside of their organization. However, identities, and stateInfo messages are still relayed.  It makes no sense that a peer of an outside organization would know about a peer's identity, and ledger height (of channels) but the only thing it will not know is its internal address.  Therefore, we should take care that *any* information about a peer that has no external endpoint is not relayed to other orgs.   ></description> </Issue>

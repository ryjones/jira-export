CDATA It is convenient to run individual tests using "go test", so defining these tests will enable users to run the tests easily. However, keep in mind the go tests are usually written to unit-test the go program code itself (not to run functional tests) and to contribute to code coverage numbers. Therefore, when creating "go test's for system or functional test purposes, you may wish to list the directory in the exclusions list in .../fabric/unit-tests/run.sh  A nice tool exists to easily translate the "go test" output to xml for reports. This is useful for automated test suites that are automatically executed from Jenkins by Continuous Improvement processes, which posts summary reports.  go get github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report  An example how to use to generate xml output which can be used by Jenkins to generate reports, to run all "go tests" in the current directory (in files named *_test.go, all function names that start with string "Test_" and contain string "CI"):  go test -v -timeout 30m -run CI | go-junit-report > ote_report.xml   ></body> </Action>

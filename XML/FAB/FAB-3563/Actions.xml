CDATA Ratnakar, can you please:  # List _the exact commands_ you used for every step # Do a "docker logs -f orderer0 2>&1" and paste the output here (in a separate file, as an attachment) # Confirm whether the E2E CLI (sans cryptogen) passes locally # Confirm whether `bootstrap.feature` passes locally  I suspect that the MSPs are not set up correctly.  ></body> </Action>

This is same as e2e_cli , all the scripts are captured  here (https://github.com/ratnakar-asara/fabric_e2e_cli/) This can run with the below command {panel}                       ./network_setup restart {panel}  2. Attached the latest orderer logs. 3. This problem is seen when I used e2e_cli to verify 4. I haven't tried BDD.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~Ratnakar  We have to post process configtxgen's output to copy the signcert to the admincert folder to give the signet Admin ROLE. There was was directory structure mixup in this manual process. Worked once corrected.  It does bring up the question if the cryptogen should copy peer's signcerts automatically into admincerts...or is there an alternate approach to using the cryptogen outputs  ~mastersingh24  ?    ></body> </Action>

CDATA The current cryptogen actually creates admin users for every peer org and includes them in the MSP for the org (which is what is used as the input in configtx.yaml)  So instead of using the peer identity, you can point to the admin identity for the org which is located in the users directory for each org.  You can also set the AdminPrincipal to Role.MEMBER in the configtx.yaml  as well (which is what the current e2e_cli uses as I recall)  ></body> </Action>

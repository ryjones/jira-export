CDATA The SCC instances are currently declared as structs, and initialized via the SCC {{Init}} function.  This is an abuse of the {{Init}} function which behaves differently from that of a regular chaincode (namely, running once per peer execution, rather than once per network initialization of the chaincode).  Additionally, these {{Init}} functions reach into the assorted peer singletons making development and test difficult.  Thus, the SCCs should be converted to construction via proper constructors, rather than {{Init}}.  ></description> </Issue>

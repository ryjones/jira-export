CDATA Some low level ledger errors get returned to higher levels with no context. For example if connection to CouchDB cannot be established, higher level APIs return an error like:   {code:java} Get http://127.0.0.1:5984/mychannel__lifecycle/namespaces%2Fmetadata%2Fmarblesp?attachments=true: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5984: connect: connection refused {code}   Need to provide some context back up the stack so that people troubleshooting know what was going on when the error was hit.  If the lowest level annotated the error with stack trace upon hitting the error, and the highest level printed the stack trace, this would be sufficient context in many scenarios.  ></description> </Issue>

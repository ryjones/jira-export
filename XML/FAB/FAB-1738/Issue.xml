CDATA Currently, a user with a tls cert may consume all events from the fabric. We need to restrict access to chains that the user is allowed to ingest events from.  as step #1, require signed event. use local MSP in the event registration's target peer to validate the Creator identity. After successfully validating the Creator, verify the signature.  // TODO: ideally this should also check each channel's "Readers" policy to ensure the identity satisfies // each channel's access control policy. This step is necessary because the registered listener is going // to get read access to all channels by receiving Block events from all channels. // However, this is not being done for v1.0 due to complexity concerns and the need to complex a stable, // minimally viable release. Eventually events will be made channel-specific, at which point this method // should be revisited   ></description> </Issue>

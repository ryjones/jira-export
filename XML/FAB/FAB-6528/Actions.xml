CDATA  ~MShakeri  I have verified this command works given the sample below...  CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=peerOrg0 CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/var/hyperledger/bddtests/volumes/peer/$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME/pe er0/localMspConfig peer channel fetch config b.block -c com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.channel1 -o 172.18.0.2:7050 --tls --cafile /var/hyperledger/bddtests/volumes/orderer/$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME/orderer0/localMspConfig/cacerts/ordererO rg0.pem --logging-level DEBUG --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer0  Can you verify you are passing the parameters correctly.  You do not need the 'true' after --tls as well.  Will close this early next week unless you wish to keep open.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you  ~jeffgarratt  for your comment.  I upgraded to Fabric 1.0.3 and now I get FORBIDDEN error for "testchainid".  And if I use my created channel id (As you have in your example) then it works.  I was following  Fabric documentation |http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configtxlator.html which looks like out of sync with source code. Or am I missing something? This testchainid is a bit annoying to understand what is really going on.     ps: You can close this issue.  ></body> </Action>

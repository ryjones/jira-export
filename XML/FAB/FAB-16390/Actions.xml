CDATA  ~varunagarwal  The change looks important and correct.   You can contribute the change to Gerrit, see the contribution instructions here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html  We'd like to get this change into release-1.4 branch as soon as possible, so if you need help maybe the author  ~chris.elder  could help to push it quickly.  I also see some other updates that could be made in this code location.  Right above it, 'Block timestamp is not defined' should really be 'Transaction timestamp is not defined'.  Right below it, the 'break' should probably be 'continue'.  wdyt  ~chris.elder     ></body> </Action>
<Action id="63245" issue="41984" author="varunagarwal" type="comment" body="Thank you  ~denyeart  and  ~chris.elder . Just going through the tutorial and should push it this weekend. In the code after a transaction is found valid, it iterates through all the `actions` followed by the `rwsets` in each one. It is my understanding that for a transaction all the `actions` should have the same `rwsets` for the endorsement to go through. In this  sample block explorer|https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/app/platform/fabric/sync/SyncService.js#L519-#L534  only the `action 0 ` is taken for capturing the new `rwset`. Should I make a similar change here?" created="2019-08-24 08:15:05.0" updateauthor="varunagarwal" updated="2019-08-24 08:15:05.0"/>

Please push a fix to fabric-samples release-1.4 branch first since we'd like this to go into the v1.4.3 tagged release early in the week, then we can show you how to cherry pick to master branch.  To work a CR in release-1.4 branch, here's what I do:  {code:java} git checkout -b release-1.4 origin/release-1.4 git checkout -b my_local_branch <make code changes> git add <file changed> git commit -s <edit commit message> git push origin HEAD:refs/for/release-1.4 {code}  Concerning your question - In current Fabric every transaction will have one and only one action, therefore you can use action 0 , or to make it future proof if Fabric adds support for multiple actions in a transaction in the future, you could iterate through the actions, knowing that for now there will only be one action in the loop.  Note, even if there are N endorsements for a transaction, there will only be one action with one rwset in the transaction (the client picks one of the endorser's rwsets to include). The transaction will include all N endorser signatures.  Then at validation/commit time, each Fabric peer ensures that the N signatures match the data, and that the number of endorsers meets the endorsement policy for the chaincode.  You can ping me (dave.enyeart) on rocketchat if you have any doubts this weekend.  ></body> </Action>

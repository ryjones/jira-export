CDATA Hi,  ~yacovm , thanks! What you are saying looks reasonable.  Two comments:   - One would likely need to extend the MSP interface with a function to return the expiration time for a certificate (or as result of validateIdentity(?) though not standard)   - For the Fabric MSP (the one V1.0 supports) this is straight forward extraction of the NOT_AFTER field of the X.509 certificate, for the Idemix MSP this may be trickier in the future; however for as long as we ask Idemix certificates to carry their expiration time in the clear, i believe we are good. Adding  ~dubovitskaya  and  ~mdr  to the discussion.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA {quote}One would likely need to extend the MSP interface with a function to return the expiration time for a certificate (or as result of validateIdentity though not standard){quote}  So, first of all - I don't think there is a reason to change the ValidateIdentity behavior or function signature. Knowing the expiration time isn't something useful to any component in the system (at the moment) but gossip, and changing the signature to return also the expiration time is in my opinion a too intrusive change and isn't cost-effective. Second - I think that since Fabric only supports x509 certificates, and IdMix certificates won't have expiration in the short term ( is that correct? )- it'd make sense to not extend the MSP interface for v1.1, and instead - extend the MessageCryptoService and post v1.1 - extend the MSP and replace the code in the MessageCryptoService implementation with a call to the MSP.  What do you think?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="29861" issue="20154" author="dubovitskaya" type="comment" body="Indeed, it is also possible to add the “expiration date” attribute to an Idemix credential. Then there is a choice – one can either reveal that attribute in the clear (might compromise a bit the privacy – depends how exact the date is) or prove in zero-knowledge that the value of  the “expiration date” attribute is bigger than the current date (prove the validity without revealing the attribute value in the clear). The second option is computationally more expensive though." created="2017-08-15 16:10:01.0" updateauthor="dubovitskaya" updated="2017-08-15 16:10:01.0"/>

CDATA Just looking into this. The x.509 v3 dates are pretty precise/exact. Let's dive down a bit into the details/specifics:  What's the structure of the Idemix credential ( ~dubovitskaya  can you post a reference to the/a doc), and ( ~elli-androulaki ) what will need to change in the MSP interface to accommodate?  Thanks, J  ></body> </Action>

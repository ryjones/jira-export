CDATA This will be the first step in sending transactions into the hyperledger network. In the v1.0 architecture, a small group of peer nodes will be designated as endorsers by the application (per knowledge acquired out-of-band on a per-chaincode basis). A transaction proposal is packaged by the SDK and sent to the list of endorsers.  The API should take a list of peers as endorsers and send the proposal to each under the cover, and collect proposal-responses from each of the endorsers and return a set object of the responses to the application.  The server-side process on the endorser for this is going to be synchronous (double check with  ~muralisr  again before proceeding).  Accordingly the return value of the API is a Promise that resolves with a set object containing proposal-responses.  Internal implementation note: Use a Promise.allSettled() (or equivalent) to collect responses before returning the set via Promise.resolve().  ></description> </Issue>

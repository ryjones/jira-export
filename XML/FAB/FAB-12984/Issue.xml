CDATA This task focuses mainly on the broadcast phase of the orderer. That is, from reception of a config-update-tx, its processing by the chain specific broadcast handler, until it goes into ordering by kafka.   This task extends the orderer config proto-buff in the following way:  * In the orderer configuration proto-buff definition, extend ConsensusType to include: ** enum "Migration State" to command & record the state of the migration per channel ** uint64 "Migration Context" to correlate the system-channel config-update-tx with the following standard-channel config-update-tx(s)  ></description> </Issue>

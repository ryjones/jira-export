CDATA With FAB-15708 and FAB-15709 implemented, an orderer can start without any genesis method, or any channels defined, but does nothing.    We need an API to be able to:  * Join this OSN to a new or an existing channel, * Remove this OSN from an existing channel, * List the channels this OSN is a member of.  This story is dedicated to the detailed design and implementation of the REST API of this feature, with the underlying behavior described in epic FAB-17712 and associated RFC. The REST API implementation will accept the queries defined and will transfer them to an abstract interface of the underlying implementation.  The first product of this task is a design document.  The REST API design is  HERE|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kYoicS_Z59gNvmuuB7VFZ6WsOL31C34dWMeOFQiIygA/edit?usp=sharing .  ></description> </Issue>

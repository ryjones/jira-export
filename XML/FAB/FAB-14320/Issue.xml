CDATA Currently where there is an error... for example if the chaincode is already installed on the peer or if the policy isn't allowing user to submit a transaction, etc because if insufficient signatures... we get a sting with a reason. But the issue is that string keeps changing between different versions. We can't reliably look for the response and give the user a proper error message. This is also an issue with translation.  Â   If could be good to get a list of error codes and what they mean so that we can use that reliably.  ></description> </Issue>

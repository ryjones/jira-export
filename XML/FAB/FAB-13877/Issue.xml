CDATA  ~mastersingh24  implemented the gRPC health check service in the peer as part of  FAB-12909 (Add HealthCheck service to GRPCServer). This provides a way for a gRPC client to determine a server is available and, for registered services, whether or not they're active.  Then, on top of that, a HealthChecker was implemented in the peer that would use the gRPC healcheck client to loopback dial the gRPC server for health checks. While, in concept a good thing, in practice there are a number of ways that this could be problematic.  We should either remove the health check client that is registered with the server or introduce configuration mechanisms that allow us to determine if we want it on or off.  ></description> </Issue>

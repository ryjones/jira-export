CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to call Set functions for setting values on the updated config. Currently the Add functions check that the existing config does not already have the value being added. Let's convert this behavior to just override whatever config value the consumer is intending to set. Let's also rename the UpdateXXX functions to use the Set prefix for consistency purposes.  Â   *Acceptance*  All AddXXX and UpdateXXX functions in the configtx package have been updated to SetXXX and support replacing the value being added. These functions should not error if the value being set already exists and should instead replace them. Use careful discretion when applying this behavior to slices (ie. SetAnchorPeer) as the struct is not a map. The goal is a duplicate is not added in these cases where an existing AnchorPeer may already exist in the slice. The examples should be updated where applicable to use the new SetXXX functions. The GoDoc should also be updated to properly reflect existing values will be overwritten where applicable.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This requires: * some PTE code development to pass in the collection name from the user testcase, if provided * writing a testcase to similar to FAB-10581 that sends the service-discovery requests repeatedly to the fabric - but this one requests layouts WITH private collection name(s).  Refer to FAB-5108 SideDB Reconciliation feature for more info. FABN-843 provides the new functionality in the node sdk.  Once this is in place in PTE, we can proceed with writing service discovery testcases with sidedb using named collection(s).  ></description> </Issue>

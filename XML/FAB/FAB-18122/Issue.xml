CDATA If the `cluster.BlockPuller` receives a set of endpoint to which it cannot connect (ever), and then `PullBlock()` is called, the calling thread will go into an endless loop. The `tryFetchBlock` will try to connect to some endpoint and will fail every time, sleep, and try again without limit.   see here |https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/cb1a062f9a37310c967b70528c718d25c6b95881/orderer/common/cluster/deliver.go#L117  for the loop.   This prevents the follower chain from implementing an exponential backoff and listening to the stop signal. This means that this chain cannot be `Halt()` in order to remove the follower.Chain when necessary, or stop it in tests.  It is better to return nil after a present number of retries rather than get stuck in that loop for ever.      https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/0227bd2c-c4f6-478f-be00-ee519f115180/_apis/build/builds/19160/logs/66         ></description> </Issue>

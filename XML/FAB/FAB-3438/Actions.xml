CDATA This particular issue was resolved for me on my windows machine when using the "release" from here: https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-verify-x86_64/28/  I found the link from here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2986  However, with this release, I am seeing an error when instantiating chaincode: {quote}Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = 2 desc = open /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/mychaincode.1.0: no such file or directory{quote}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The original error reference in this JIRA occurs because configtxgen cannot find the config file.  This is likely due to the fact that *FABRIC_CFG_PATH* is not being set properly.  Not sure if the docs were wrong at the time, but the current getting started does say to set *FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD*.  Closing this.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA in module mode, go will often access remote VCS repositories to validate pinned versions are valid with respect to expectations at the time the go.sum file was written. Alternatively, if a go.sum is not written, the repositories will be accessed to check for version information and tags. This is expensive.  To reduce the cost, go can be configured to point to a proxy that hosts indexes for packages and calculated sums. The google go team hosts proxy.golang.org for publicly accessible repositories.  Acceptance: During build and test, if I have {{$GOPROXY}} configured, it uses my configuration. This includes containerized chaincode builds. If the proxy is not explicitly configured, it should be conditionally set to  https://proxy.golang.org|https://proxy.golang.org/ .  In addition to inheriting and honoring the calling environment, this should allow end-users to provide their own proxy configuration when using private repositories.  The environment variable only *needs* to be set for the golang platform. Integration test configuration should whitelist GOPROXY.  ></description> </Issue>

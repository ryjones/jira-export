CDATA There is odd behavior, persisted from v0.5/v0.6 in which, if a series of 3 transactions queries/invokes for a chaincode arrives, and the chaincode is not running, then, the first transaction starts the chaincode and the second and third transactions immediately fail.  This is unintuitive for a number of reasons, but also makes the life of application developers much harder, as they must handle errors which may be transient or not, depending on the state of the chaincode.  Thanks to the refactor done on the chaincode package, it is now a fairly simple thing to do, to change this behavior so that all callers wait for the chaincode container to start.  ></description> </Issue>

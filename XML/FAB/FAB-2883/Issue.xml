CDATA In order to support PKCS11,   3rd party package|https://github.com/miekg/pkcs11  which has a dependency on libtool was added.  This complicates things when trying to build native binaries locally as you now have to install a dependency (which may or may not be easily available / installable on all platforms).  Conveniently, Go supports the notion of build tags for "conditional" compilation.  In order to optionally support building without PKCS11 support, we'll add the build tag {{nopkcs11}} to the bccsp factory package and then add a GO_TAGS flag to our makefile as well as adding {{-nopkcs11}} targets for the peer and orderer.  The {{configtxgen}} target will be modified to always build without PKCS11 support since it is not required.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA All consenters read several of their config settings (think sharedconfig) from the genesis block that is generated by a bootstrapper. The only bootstrapper available so far is the static one. However, when testing we need to be able to modify several of these config values on the fly.  Therefore the bootstrapper should be able to read a config object (which is itself created by reading the orderer.yaml file and -if set- its associated ENV vars).  An example of that would be the KafkaBrokers value. For unit tests the "right" value is "127.0.0.1:9092", whereas for the current Docker Compose-based BDD tests the right value is "kafka0:9092".  Since this bootstrapper is no longer static, renaming the package seems appropriate.  For production we will need to introduce file-based bootstrapper that reads the genesis block created by the genesis block tool.  ></description> </Issue>

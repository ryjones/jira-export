CDATA When we expand the root TLS CA in the channel config, after Raft membership has expanded with an OSN that is issed a certificate by a new TLS CA, the TLS client handshake uses the old root CA pool and as a result the added orderer cannot be reached by the existing ones, because their dialers reject its certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

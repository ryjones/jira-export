<Issue id="45820" key="FAB-18157" number="18157" project="10002" reporter="ptippett" creator="ptippett" type="10001" summary="When instantiating chaincode with indices, peer should log if they already exist." priority="3" status="10000" created="2020-08-13 18:17:25.0" updated="2020-11-02 15:00:08.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="59723" archived="N"> <description><! CDATA Currently if a user instantiates a chaincode that specifies couch indices, the peer logs the following message:  ```  2020-08-13T13:34:15.582571949Z  34m2020-08-13 13:34:15.582 UTC  couchdb  CreateIndex -> INFO f69d1 0m Created CouchDB index  indexOwner  in state database  dummy_marbles  using design document  _design/indexOwnerDoc  ```  Â   However, if upgrading or instantiating new chaincode that uses the same index/indices, nothing is logged.Â  This has caused confusion as to whether the index already existed or there was some issue and it didn't get created at all.  Â   The request is for a similar log message saying something like "index  IndexOwner  in state database  dummy_marbles  already exists."Â  I suppose in the case where it already exists but has been modified, a similar "modifying" message would be nice.  Â   Not high priority, but I think it would help.Â  I didn't turn on debug logs, so maybe this does get logged at other logging levels?Â  If so, it's infrequent enough that I think moving it to info would be OK.

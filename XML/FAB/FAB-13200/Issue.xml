CDATA When running the etcdraft tests, ginkgo highlights that many of the the tests take longer than 5 seconds to complete. This is generally an indication of test pattern issues where test assets are not properly used, fake clocks need to be employed, timeouts are too long, or polling / notifications are not effectively.  The tests should be examined and adjusted to reduce their execution time to milliseconds instead of seconds.  /cc  ~kchristidis    ></description> </Issue>

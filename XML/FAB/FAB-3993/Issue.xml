CDATA Currently, the sample clients for the orderer are working without MSP signer and TLS features. This improvement would provide a new sample client with these two features.  The original client deliver_stdout assumes no TLS dial option and the payload was not signed with any certificate. A new client extended deliver_stdout was created to include   1. TLS dial option which requires the user to specify the CA file for TLS;  2. MSP signing the payload which requires the user to specify msp directory which contains folder signcerts, keystores, admincerts and cacerts.

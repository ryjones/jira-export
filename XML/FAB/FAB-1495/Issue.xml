CDATA cchecker was introduced to test chaincode under concurrent invokes in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1475. In addition to sending load concurrently, it also allows chaincode to be tested for consistency and correctness (did the ledger commits match expected state values ?) using a "shadow" CC validator (typically written by the chaincode developer or a tester). This helps to fix chaincode issues before production.  This story is for doing the following tasks to move the chaincode checker to the top level  * add logging support * add UT for the ccchecker * add documentation   ></description> </Issue>

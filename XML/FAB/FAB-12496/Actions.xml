CDATA So my only pushback on what you say is that this is a default install.  A *lot* of people will take our default install and spin it up and think they are good to go.  We specifically point out that bug reports against the default install are valid security concerns.  Maybe the solution is to add more in the documentation in the form of a warning that ZK security needs to be hardened or that the ZK instance needs to be behind a firewall to prevent unauthorized access?  If we need to do a documentation change, I'll make this a low priority security bug and pay out a small bounty.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The e2e_cli is not actually the sample or tutorial we put in our docs and we actually removed the e2e_cli in the current master branch and we'll cut a 1.4 release from there.  e2e_cli was use for "poor man's" integration testing in earlier releases.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Gari's right in that the E2E CLI is no longer in master, nor was it meant to be a reference guide.  I see David's point however. Would this one-line warning on making sure the Kafka/ZK clusters are secure work?Â https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/27938/  ></body> </Action>

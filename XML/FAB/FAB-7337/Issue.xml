CDATA The current peer code contains a check for compliance of the proposal against the `aclmgmt.LSCC_GETDEPSPEC` policy that is executed before a chaincode invocation is executed. This check is there because  * if cc lifecycle is in LSCC, LSCC is invoked to retrieve the deployment spec, and the check is inlined in the LSCC invocation * if cc lifecycle is in the config tree, the check was introduced to mirror the legacy code path.  The purpose of this JIRA is twofold: # remove the invocation of aclmgmt.LSCC_GETDEPSPEC if the cc lifecycle is in the config tree # remove the invocation of aclmgmt.LSCC_GETDEPSPEC if the cc lifecycle is managed through LSCC   ~yacovm   ></description> </Issue>

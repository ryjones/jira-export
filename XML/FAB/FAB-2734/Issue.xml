CDATA There is a gRPC logger that is silenced by default because it logs messages when peers disconnect: {quote}2017/03/10 20:01:22 grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: grpc: the connection is closing 2017/03/10 20:01:22 grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: grpc: the connection is closing 2017/03/10 20:01:22 grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: grpc: the connection is closing{quote}  The silencing line is found in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/gossip/util/logging.go#L57  Sometimes, however- this information is useful for debugging issues.

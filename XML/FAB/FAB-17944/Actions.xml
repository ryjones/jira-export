CDATA This is a much larger problem than I first realized:  So essentially the non-release tags of Fabric NPM Packages have a floating dependency tag. So if you pull the 2.0.0-unstable tag of fabric-client, its package.json has the `unstable` tag for its dependencies, not the `2.0.0-unstable` tag. So while you are using the `2.0.0-unstable` tag, its dependencies are resolved to `2.1.1-unstable.407` since that is the latest unstable tag. This is really bad versioning in the Node projects.  The only solution is to pull a release version that had everything we need in it, and the only thing available is the `2.0.0-beta.2` version. I recommend we pin on this until we can rewrite PTE to handle these problems.  ></body> </Action>

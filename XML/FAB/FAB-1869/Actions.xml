CDATA ------------ This conception (above) of architecture is the draft that I wrote. All diagrams are pending design team.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6113/1/docs/architecture.md The reason for the before and after difference in Gerrit (my version is the after) b/c an architecture.md file already existed. To resolve.  Here are the specific docs that we have in the build currently for architecture. Will post to the Issues:   http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ/architecture_FAQ/   6:17    http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/   6:18    http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch-deep-dive/   6:18    I didn't write any of those. Why are they at the bottom of the TOC? don't know.  What I did write on architecture is this; it's higher level than the others. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6113/1/docs/architecture.md    ></body> </Action>

CDATA When the peer receives a configuration transaction, as defined in FAB-496, it needs to call the Configuration System Chaincode (CSCC) which performs the following: # map the changes into the correct read-write-set for the ledger to store # process the configuration changes if applicable;  ex, removing a member CA from the chain, calling gossip # commit the transaction to ledger  CSCC will provide the following functions: # process "join channel" for the peer to start receiving transactions on the specified channel # process transaction on commit # process "queries" to return configuration data on channel (status, members, crypto)  For now, we will not require any endorsement of the transaction though this may be added in the future.   ></description> </Issue>

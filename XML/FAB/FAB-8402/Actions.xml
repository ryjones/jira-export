Currently, people can go look at the peer, orderer logs and figure out the failure.  However, that isn't possible in the production world where the enduser using the peer cli only has the cli logs.

CDATA Just wanted to follow up on this: I've recently finished setting up a Fabric network with TLS enabled on different components.

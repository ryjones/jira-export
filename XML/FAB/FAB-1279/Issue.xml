CDATA Because every consensus type (Kafka, SBFT, Solo) will need to handle chain creation and management, it makes sense to write this as a layer outside of the actual consensus implementation.  This should include intercepting chain creation requests and routing them to the ordering system channel, and invoking the constructors for the backing resources once the request has been ordered.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When missing pvtData reconciler asks for missing data info, it is necessary to pass the missing pvtdata info associated with the most recent block so that missing pvtdata in the state db can be fixed sooner to reduce the "pvtdata does not match with hashed data" error during endorserment. In order to give priority to missing pvtData in the most recent block, we use reverse order-preserving encoding/decoding. This simplifies the implementation of GetMissingPvtDataInfoForMostRecentBlocks().  Â   Currently, this encoding/decoding is present in the core/ledger/util. Given that it is used only in pvtdatastorage package and we need to keep such code close to the consumer, we move the endcoding/decoding util to pvtdatastorage package itself.  ></description> </Issue>

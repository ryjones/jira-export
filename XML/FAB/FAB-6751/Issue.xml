CDATA The new encryption library provides two different capabilities that are called in two different ways:  1) Ability to directly Encrypt() and Decrypt() in chaincode  2) Ability to call PutState()/GetState() with a encshim to put/get encrypted values, for example:  es.With(ent).PutState(args 0 , b)     Then encshim wrapper is confusing and unnecessary in my opinion, I prefer to directly expose Encrypt() and Decrypt() only.  This will be more intuitive for chaincode developers, and less for Fabric to maintain.  I would suggest to remove encshim and update the example to demonstrate direct Encrypt() and Decrypt().    One chaincode data pattern is to encrypt certain fields in JSON but not others (for queryability of non-confidential fields).  Again, the explicit Encrypt() will provide the chaincode author with full control and flexibility to do these types of things, while encshim will not.  ></description> </Issue>

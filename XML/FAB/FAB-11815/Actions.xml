CDATA Impact - High  This issue is visible during onboarding organization resulting into new channel since couch database are not created by peer until the first data appear in it. Data would appear only if endorsement is successful and endorsement is successful only if index is available for use and to create index manually (approach used in v1.0.x), there is a need to have database available. This is catch-22.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Multi channel Deploy fails if user doesn't have both latest and snapshot tags of hyperledger/fabric-ccenv image  *Issue Description:* While deploying chaincode using multi channel execution commands, observed deploy is failing in the following scenarios.  *Scenario1:*  Deploy fails from node sdk, If user doesn't have hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest *Scenario2*: , Deploy fails from CLI commands, If user doesn't have hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:<snapshot> tag  This works as expected when user builds images (*make docker*)and spinup the network using docker-compose files but deploy fails to the users who don't want to build images manually. You can consider the scenario like developers participating in hackthons or hackfest. They just spinup the network using docker-compose which will pull all the required images(Using Docker-compose file we can pull any one specified tag like "latest" or "snapshot")  *Workaround:* workaround for this mentioned here from Lines 7 to 19 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/sfhackfest/docker-compose-gettingstarted.yml#L7.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~swetharepakula   ~yukkyhira   We are going to delete this script. It has been broken since we dropped the `stable` from our Docker image tags. I spoke with Dave Enyeart, this is a convenience script for users, and has no practical purpose in fabric and we have historically had trouble keeping up with the maintenance on it. Given that no one has raised an issue with parts of it being broken for months now, we are just going to delete it. I will open a separate Jira to do that, we can close this one.  ></body> </Action>

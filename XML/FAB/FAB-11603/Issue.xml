CDATA Setting up a production level fabric network lab for running everlasting longruns with multiple combinations of organizations in multiple channels, multiple chaincodes running in the channels using different traffic patterns.  Â   Setup a cluster on IKS  Setup Block Storage to use for storing data  Launch the fabric network keeping the lab current with stable images from fabric master branch  Create multiple channels and join peers to channels  Install and instantiate different chaincodes on channels  Different long running traffic patterns using different chaincodes (samplecc, samplejs, marbles02, marbles02 with private data) using separate PTE clients  ></description> </Issue>

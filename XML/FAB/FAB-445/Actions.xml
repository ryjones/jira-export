CDATA If a transaction contains multiple read-write sets as a result of including different simulations results in a single transaction, the validation should also check for read conflicts between the read-write sets in addition to the read conflicts check with preceding transactions.  For instance, if a transaction contains two independently prepared read-write sets. One of them may transfer $10 from account A to account B and other may transfer $10 from account A to account C. Independently, both of the read-write sets may pass the version check and if committed - will amount to double spending.  So, from the validation point of view, both should be treated as if these were independent transactions (for covering the special case of conflicts between the read-write sets enclosed with in a single transaction). However, commit needs to understand the relation between these two read-write sets and make sure that non of these two gets committed when either of these two are marked as invalidated.  ></body> </Action>

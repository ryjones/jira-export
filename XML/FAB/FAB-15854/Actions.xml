CDATA We could change gen_CfgInputs.sh script (if not too complicated), or we could modify the input files channel/chaincode names for those selected tests that we want to be able to use either as they are (standalone) or with gen_CfgInputs.sh.  The fact that gen_CfgInputs.sh does not use same naming format as the existing 100+ testcases seems like a bug. Not exactly, but this does block the easier way (using gen_CfgInputs.sh for some of the steps) to add more tests to the system test suite - so it might be worth doing this now if it is not too much work, so we could quickly add some more tests to the k8s system test suite.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The 60 second delay is based on config option *peer.gossip.pvtData.pullRetryThreshold* default of 60s.  This is being documented already and can be configured lower as desired. The default is intentionally long to draw attention to the network misconfiguration, rather than allowing many blocks to get committed with missing private data before the misconfiguration is noticed.  I think the right time to improve the behavior is when the private data 'reconcilliation' feature comes in FAB-5093, expected to be in v1.4 timeframe. At that point it will be possible to proceed with missing private data quicker, and then resolve the missing data via reconcilliation.  Until reconcilliation function exists, it is most important to draw attention to the misconfiguration.  I will link this to the reconcilliation feature FAB-5093 and return for now.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Things work well with Reconciliation feature. Accepting the Dev team description of behavior. Workarounds exist for observed behavior; we could add anchor peers or change the config parameter.  ></body> </Action>

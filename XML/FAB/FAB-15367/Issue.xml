CDATA The {{MockStub}} implementation in chaincode/shim is incomplete, poorly documented, and incorrectly placed into a production package.  In particular, the following are unimplemented:  {code} GetPrivateDataHash DelPrivateData GetPrivateDataByRange GetPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey GetPrivateDataueryResult GetQueryResult GetHistoryForKey GetTransient GetBinding GetArgsSlice {code}  We should move it out of the chaincode/shim package to make it clear it is not part of the production code. We should further clearly document that we intend to remove it in the future. Developers can use their own mock/fake tools to generate mocks that are more appropriate for their needs.  ></description> </Issue>

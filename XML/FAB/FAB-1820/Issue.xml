CDATA We currently bake the "peer's" TLS key in during the creation of a deployment payload, which is much too early and thus almost assuredly incorrect.  Today, this deployment payload is formed by the client/CLI, and thus it is in no position to actually know what peer will be on the other end of a connection with the chaincode.  Rather than baking the peers certificate in during deployment, each peer should inject the certificate just-in-time using something like a docker bind mount.  This will ensure each chaincode runs in with the proper context.   ></description> </Issue>

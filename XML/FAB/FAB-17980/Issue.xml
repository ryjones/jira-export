CDATA To achieve more consistent results on the barebones test scenarios, the tests should be migrated from docker, to kubernetes running on dedicated VM's.  Set KUBE_CONFIG to execute on Kubernetes  go run main.go -k $KUBE_CONFIG  Use ibmcloud CLI to login to the cluster and get the kubeconfig  The client will also need to be on a dedicated VM. They exist in the `Fabric System Test` pool.  We need to clean up the directory at the end of the test.  Acceptance criteria: Performance tests are executed on kubernetes.  ></description> </Issue>

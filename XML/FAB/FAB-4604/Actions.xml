CDATA The SDK icon looks more like a settings icon.  Here are a few alternatives that might be interesting to pull pieces from: *  https://imagga-com-assets.azureedge.net/static/images/api-icon.svg  *  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-api/media/index/app-service-api.svg   Maybe combine the two and replacing the plug ends in the first with the interface symbol in the second.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~tkuhrt  would a more blueish-green/aqua color work better?  Also, can you explain why specifically you're not a fan of the green? For instance, would a different type of green work better in your mind.  We chose green to get a way from blue- which is predominantly used in corporate branding.    ~SarahMills  - nice job. feedback for the icons:  *SDK* - Think of the SDK as a box of goodies or set of tools that are at your disposal to build apps with. A toolbox, a kit of some kind could be a better alternative.   *Wallet*- have the right fasten wrap around to give the sense it's secure.   *Transaction* - tx is too small to read when it's reduced in size. Have TX larger to be the dominant part of the icon.   *peer*- this is tricky because the original Hyperledger logo was meant to be a lot of different things, including peers communicating with one another. But a peer can also have multiple runtimes working together on a single machine- hence another type of network. Anyhow, I suggest representing a physical machine that is connected like in Andrea's V1 motion graphic animation.   *lock privacy*- to me it doesn't look enough like a lock.   *car/truck*- we give dimension inconsistently in the icons. e.g. the wallet has dimension but these don't. I would suggest giving all the icons a sense of depth and/or dimension to be consistent. i think that would help to evoke a sense of tangibility as well.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~tkuhrt  Thanks for sharing. From what I understand from the Marketing Committee, each project will have unique qualities (e.g. colors) to help viewers and users identify with. Therefore, I don't think reusing the exact same palette as the Hyperledger Project is the correct way to go. A possible solutions is we use the grays with the green (or a different green) to help align but at the same time distinguish.    ~gtewallace  I know you're coming close to determining guidelines, but let me know if you disagree with my assertion.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~tkuhrt  the logos + color palette that is chosen for Fabric will influence the colors of the icons and the design of documentation.  Our intention for supplying svg files was so that anyone in the community could go to a tool like this:  http://editor.method.ac/ , drag and drop the svg, and change the color to whatever they need (or their project's branding colors) without losing image quality. They could also add or remove vector information and re-upload for others to use.  ></body> </Action>

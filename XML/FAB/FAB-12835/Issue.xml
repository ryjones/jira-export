CDATA Restart peers being used for endorsements, repeatedly. Minimum 12 hours; run longer if testbed can handle it.  Create a network with 2 orgs, 2 peers per org. Require endorsements from two peers including one peer in each org. Use service discovery.  Use private data, with all 4 peers inside the collection, and PULL all private data at validation time.   Send a good load of traffic using multiple threads.  In org1: restart each peer, and soon after it recovers, restart the other peer in org1; bounce back and forth between them continuously.  In org2: stop a peer, and delay several minutes, then start it back up. Soon after it recovers, do the other peer in org2; bounce back and forth between them continuously.  ></description> </Issue>

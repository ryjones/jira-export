CDATA After joining a channel with only one consenter but two orderer endpoints via the channel participation API, the orderer returns a status of 200 and the following channel info: {noformat} Status: 200 { 	"name": "participation-trophy", 	"url": "/participation/v1/channels/participation-trophy", 	"clusterRelation": "follower", 	"status": "onboarding", 	"height": 0 } {noformat} However, attempts to remove this channel hangs the channel participation API and no further requests will succeed (unclear on its impact on the other functions of the orderer).  ></description> </Issue>

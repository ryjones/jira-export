CDATA The marbles chaincodes have been removed from fabric/examples/. These are some versions of marbles that are available. One option, used in some of the behave tests: since marbles02 is a subset of marbles02_private, we could simply use the marbles02_private (go) chaincode in fabric-test for any tests that require marbles02 or marbles02_private.    * fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02/go * fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02/node * fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02_private/go    * fabric-test/chaincodes/marbles/node * fabric-test/chaincodes/marbles02_private    //go version only     First thought, at a high level, the objective is to change all the scripts and test files in the fabric-test/tools/ (NL or PTE or whatever directories) to change from using marbles or marbles02_private in the fabric/examples/ directory  * fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02 (or any relative references to marbles02) * fabric/examples/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/  to * fabric-test/chaincodes/marbles02_private        NOTE: the couchdb index tests must use the marbles02* chaincodes in fabric-samples, since they contain the required folder for meta information .../go/META_INF/ : * fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02/go/ , or,  * fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/  {quote} PTE/CITest/scenarios/FAB-8251.sh  PTE/CITest/scenarios/FAB-8252.sh  PTE/CITest/README.md (only _some_ of the changes here)  and other dependencies too:  PTE/CITest/scenarios/FAB-8694-4i  PTE/CITest/scenarios/FAB-9575-4i  PTE/CITest/scenarios/FAB-6813-4i {quote}  *Or better yet*: the  META_INF directory with index files could be copied into fabric-test/chaincodes/marbles02_private/ , so marbles02_private can be used for every test, and so the indexing files will be used for every test. (Note it is a different directory structure under marbles02/go/ than under marbles02_private/go/, so the paths used in the marbles02 tests should be changed too if consolidating with marbles02_private).   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Decided NOT to update and move all chaincodes into fabric-test/chaincodes from fabric/examples and fabric-samples/chaincode. That can be done with another jira task, if necessary. Instead, I decided to fix the chaincodePath as painlessly as possible. Most were moved from fabric/examples to fabric-samples, so that is the update we will make for marbles chaincodes. I also found some example02 paths that needed changing for rarely-run test files in fabric-test, so I fixed them too.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/31016/  ></body> </Action>

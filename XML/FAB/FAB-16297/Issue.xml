CDATA The private data feature became stable from v1.2 onwards. To allow the initiation of pvtdata store with non-zero block height (mainly during a rolling upgrade from an existing v1.1 network to v1.2), we introduced pvtdata Init() function which would take the height of block store and set it as a height of pvtdataStore.Â   We can remove the pvtdataStore Init() function in v2.0  ></description> </Issue>

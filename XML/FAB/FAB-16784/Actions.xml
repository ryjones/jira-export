CDATA  ~bh4rtp  what version of fabric are you building? I can't recreate this on 1.4 or master. I checked the make process and it builds the binaries locally and then does an explicit copy  {code:java} COPY payload/peer /usr/local/bin {code}  not the entire payload directory, so I don't see a path to ending up with multiple binaries in the image.  ></body> </Action>

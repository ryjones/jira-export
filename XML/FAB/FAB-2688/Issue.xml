CDATA Currently delivery service client pulls blocks from the ordering service and gossip them to other peer without actually validating them. Exactly same issue exists also in in gossip state transfer layer, where anti entropy procedure receives blocks via peer-to-peer communication and commits them directly into the ledger without actually verifying them.  Need to add blocks verification in both of these cases leveraging MessageCryptoService implementation, VerifyBlock API.  ></description> </Issue>

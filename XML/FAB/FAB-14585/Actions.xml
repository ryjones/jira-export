CDATA There are several important functions within core/peer for usage by certain filters and SCC plugins.   Some of these functions are providing access to package-level objects. In particular "var chains"  (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/peer/peer.go#L199) accessed by using:  * GetLedger (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/peer/peer.go#L479) * GetChannelConfig(L5012) * GetStableChannelConfig (L490) * GetPolicyManager (L512) * Various wrappers of the above, etc.  As with my comment in FAB-14583, I'm also curious about the roadmap of these refactoring tickets and how it might impact a possible future where we could have a more module-based build of a peer (allowing for customized/extended peers from a common base).  ></body> </Action>

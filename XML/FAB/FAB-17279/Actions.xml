CDATA This shouldn't be too hard, as discovery simply relies on a one method interface: {code} type chaincodeMetadataFetcher interface { 	// ChaincodeMetadata returns the metadata of the chaincode as appears in the ledger, 	// or nil if the channel doesn't exist, or the chaincode isn't found in the ledger 	Metadata(channel string, cc string, loadCollections bool) *chaincode.Metadata } {code}  To retrieve the endorsement policy and the collection config.  If we extend it to have a collection (or an empty string if no collection) parameter as well which puts in the endorsement policy in the Metadata the EP according to whether the collection level EP is set or not, then things should work, as long as the current code works properly.   I'll try this approach and see where it gets us.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Now, if a chaincode installs on a target peer, we just can get the installed chaincode info with name, path, ver, escc, vscc, etc. Not including the source code, like something in the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec.  I found it has a function, named "GetChaincodeFromLocalStorage", which can get the target chaincode's ccpack. So, why the lscc doesn't provide a method like "getLocalCCData" to return the chaincode data?Â   ></description> </Issue>

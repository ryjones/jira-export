CDATA While there are targets to make binaries for some packages, we need a more uniform way of creating the binaries we want to publish.  We currently have 3 build platforms -  linux-amd64, ppc64le and s390x - but we don't have build environments for windows-amd64 or darwin-amd64 (macos).  Go has the ability to cross-compile so we'll add release targets for all platforms and can choose to cross-compile for Windows / macos in the CI for linux-amd64  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA dave.enyeart 2:57 AM   @cbf I’ve run through the complete Build Your First Network. A few minor issues: 1) The network name issue - already being worked:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10913   2) The  byfn.sh|http://byfn.sh/  assumes /bin is in a peer directory to /first-network, while the manual instructions assume that /bin is in a subdirectory of /first-network. Which one is correct? 3) The Using CouchDB section uses marbles02 chaincode (JSON based), however the marbles02 chaincode is not available as an example within /first-network. Do we want to copy marbles02 into fabric-samples? (I don’t like having multiple copies in source, ‘fabric' and 'fabric-samples', due to dual maintenance concerns. I assume we’ll eventually remove them from ‘fabric’?) 4) In the doc the manual instructions still reference -p during chaincode instantiate. -p has been removed. This causes an error. 5) In the doc there are some old section name references, which do not exist after the doc refactor - can be fixed together with (4)  ></description> </Issue>

I guess you can extend the channel config with the public keys of all peers, and then use a custom endorsement plugin that instead of putting the endorsements as they are, you just put the ring signatures without the corresponding certificates.  You'll also need a matching, custom validation plugin, that - uses the ring signature verification using the channel config.  For a research project I believe it's not a bad idea, but i don't think you can do this in Fabric, because endorsement policies and ring signatures don't work very well.  When you evaluate an endorsement policy you have to know the principals of peers, namely - their organizational association.  If you make this information anonymous then you rule out all use cases based on endorsement policies that have ANDs of more than a single organization.  Unless you can "prove" at time of validation that the transaction was signed by peers that satisfy the endorsement policy.  Another thing to consider is, that in the future you might be able to have anonymous endorsements using idemix, and idemix is already part of Fabric.  Lastly - it's not a very good idea to be done in Fabric because if a peer's public key is compromised you need to remove its public key from the channel config. Since peers communicate with each other, if you remove the peer's public key from the channel config, the other peers in the channel might somehow link between the long term removal of the peer from the network, and the removal of its public certificate from the channel config and thus link the peer's organization to the public key, and de-anonymize backwards all transactions, no?

CDATA  ~yacovm  I did not get this point "if you remove the peer's public key from the channel config, the other peers in the channel might somehow link between the long term removal of the peer from the network, and the removal of its public certificate from the channel config and thus link the peer's organization to the public key, and de-anonymize backwards all transactions, no?" ... how can it get linked ?  The endorsement policy to be used is just t-out-of-N , any t endorser can choose to vote. One need not specify who has to endorse. I am not making it generic for AND or OR policy.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~yacovm  The case you have stated is a special one I presume. It will be true for one peer remaining alive and rest dropping out. For other cases, one cannot trace back the identity of the peer whose certificate has been revoked because we are treating both the public key as well the private key as the secret information. The construction done and the correctness proof of the signature proof of knowledge shows that an adversary can trace the actual endorser with probability no more than half.  For the case you have stated,  these certificates will be present in the certificate revoked list or CRL..I agree some gaps are still there but these checks can be inserted..as in if a peer has been revoked then it is not supposed to endorse any more...since the "AccumulatPubKey" and "GeneratePubKeyWitness" function is executed just once during setup phase and not repeated further...so a revoked peer may continue to endorse ...so a periodic cleanup is needed over here   ></body> </Action>

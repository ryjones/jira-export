CDATA State databases (e.g. goleveldb, CouchDB) currently implement the VersionedDB interface.  However this requires compiling state database implementations into Fabric itself.  It would be more clean to use the new go plugin architecture to support truly pluggable state databases that do not need to be compiled into Fabric.  This will make it easier to implement and support additional state databases, outside of the Fabric build.  Please see the design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdxPWdxUwEDwRAKY8tewgjqh2qTZCm6RZ6tU9ccm4dM/edit?usp=sharing  ></description> </Issue>

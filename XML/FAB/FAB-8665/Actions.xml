<Action id="49379" issue="28230" author="binhn" type="comment" body="We could make CouchDB the first plugin and run all the existing tests against it. If all pass, a good sign. Or the other way around if we think CouchDB should be the default. I don&apos;t really have an opinion 1 way or the other, just that we shouldn&apos;t have 2 DBs in the base code." created="2018-08-25 20:10:30.0" updateauthor="binhn" updated="2018-08-25 20:10:30.0"/>

<Action id="49391" issue="28230" author="senthil1" type="comment" body=" ~binhn  Most solutions are already using CouchDB as the StateDB. Hence, i am not sure whether it is good to make it as a plugin now. We anyway need a simple embedded KV store (irrespective of the stateDB) to keep metadata info (like purge entries, history index etc...)." created="2018-08-27 06:27:47.0" updateauthor="senthil1" updated="2018-08-27 06:27:47.0"/>

CDATA It has been passed since your last comment. Is there any changes for this issue?  I wanna use mongodb as statedb because of the poor performance of couchdb - especially on write action.  In my lab, I changed statedb to mongodb plugin( with official mongodb driver) and I can get almost almost same TPS with goleveldb.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA Go plugins have proven to be very problematic  ... we are moving away from Go plugins as external plug points. We could consider using a plugin architecture assuming we actually build the plugins with the Fabric tree as part of a release.  But building and maintaining them outside the tree is no longer the direction we are going.    ></body> </Action>

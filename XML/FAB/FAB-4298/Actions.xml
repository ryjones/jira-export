CDATA lSuggestion:  Add a README file to the containing directory of these files to define what a 'configuration' even means... what can I accomplish with these .yaml files?  What do each of the files accomplish?    All the files should contain definitions of terms (from the glossary, of course, but repeat it here) - what is a configuration?  what is a consortium?  what is a genesis block / blocks?  I think you can assume we know what an orderer is, but what is the significance of it's relationship to thw consortium?    e.g. i read this  Different configuration profiles may be encoded here to be specified as parameters to the configtxgen tool.  I just spent a day with "getting started" and ran this tool yesterday, but I now need to remember what it does — right, it generates crytographic gorp for spinning up a blockchain network without a Certificate Authority?    Are consortium members the same as org member names?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA It would be very helpful to just have the structure of each of the sections defined... I might be old fashioned, but some BNF grammar would be useful here...  I read  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configtxgen.html?highlight=configtxgen|http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configtxgen.html?highlight=configtxgen,   and I'm still confused as if this file would every really be used for a real deployment?  The definition of the "Profiles" indicates it is just sample, not that it is where you put the real definitios of your topology  ></body> </Action>

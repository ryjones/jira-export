The retry will therefore fail due to revision number conflict.  The peer will think it failed, when in fact it succeeded.  Peer panics when it can&apos;t process the block to completion, since subsequent blocks should not be processed. Need to fix retry logic to account for this scenario, potentially by introducing a higher level retry that could get the new revision number for a final attempt." priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-05-06 02:22:50.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:12:36.0" resolutiondate="2017-06-01 11:37:30.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="38356"/>

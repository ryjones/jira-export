CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like to be able to retrieve the entire channel configuration without manually parsing the config transaction. Now that we have the supporting functions in place for retrieving all dependent fields, we should be able to support retrieval of the entire channel configuration.     *Acceptance*  I should be able to call a function for retrieving channel configuration that returns a config.Channel.  ></description> </Issue>

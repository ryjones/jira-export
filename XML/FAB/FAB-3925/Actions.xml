CDATA We tried multiple options to publish fabric-binaries to nexus snapshots/releases/staging url's but not much help.. With the recent changes (adding permissions) to staging-deploy plugin we are unable to publish tar files with the existing configuration and never succeeded after that.  We are still trying to make it work with below options 1) with pom.xml 2) without pom.xml.. As a workaround we can look into the below option.  will ask users to download platform specific tar file from the below link (Not final url, this is a test url from sandbox)   https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/logs/sandbox/fabric-binary/    |https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/logs/sandbox/fabric-binary/ or we can provide `curl` commands to download tar files.   Once the patch is merged ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8939/)  the production link looks like this  https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/logs/jobbuilder/fabric-binary/..|https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/logs/sandbox/fabric-binary/   Once we cut alpha2 binaries will not touch this job and make sure binaries are available all the time. Have to check with  ~ryjones  on this.  ></body> </Action>

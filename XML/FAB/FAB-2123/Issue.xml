CDATA @all @mastersingh24 @lehors and I were just discussing a few things and the subject of the alpha release came up (what a surprise!) clearly there is a lot of interest on the part of people coming to the project to have v1.0 images that they can use and explore yet, as we have discussed, we aren't really ready for alpha one compromise we discussed, which I think the three of us agreed would be worth considering, was to take the images we created for the hackfest last week, and publish those to dockerhub/u/hyperledger as fabric-xxx:v1.0-preview images - update the docs accordingly so that they gettingstarted.md points to these images and promote it as ready for developer preview. basically, we would not release these from a build (there's some additional bootstrap cruft that makes this intenable just yet)  ></description> </Issue>

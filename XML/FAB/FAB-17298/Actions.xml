CDATA I would be against adding too much more information about cryptogen to the docs (other than clarifying a necessary step for launching a network, as in your Windows example), other perhaps than to reiterate that it's not only not for production, but that even in development environments it obscures processes that are vital to understand. Over and over again we see people having issues with their certificates. It makes us wonder how much of that is due to the desire to spin networks up quickly using a tool like cryptogen that glosses over the first few steps in network building.  If all you're interested in is developing smart contracts, then cryptogen is a valid tool to use to help spin up a network. But if that's all you need your network for — as a tool for testing your smart contract — why do you need to learn more about cryptogen?  This isn't necessarily a door we should be opening and explaining, even if we're just going to shut it again.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When peer starts up, it uses the retry strategy as mentioned in your first bullet.  This is configurable here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L571-L572   Also implemented in 1.0.x release branch.  The time between each retry is doubled, to ensure a fast startup for most scenarios, but ability to wait increasingly longer times if couchdb doesn't respond quickly.  In your peer logs, you can often see that it takes one or two retries before the peer resumes startup.  Marking as Done.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Since block sequence numbers modeled with uint64 golang type and if committer returns current ledger height equals to zero the gossip metastate will be initialized with -1, which will caused by overflow and will lead anti entropy to request large amount of missing blocks to transfer.  Need to make sure state transfer will not be initialized with ledger of height zero.  ></description> </Issue>

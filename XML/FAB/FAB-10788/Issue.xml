CDATA In endorser.go the tx simulation result is produced by calling _txsim.GetTxSimulationResults()_ (#L294)|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/endorser/endorser.go#L294  followed by _txsim.Done_ before the result is serialized.  This leads to the problem that `simResult` does not contain any `RangeQueryInfo` items, as they are added when _txsim.Done_ is invoked. In other words, this bug causes that there are no range query reads in the read/write set.   Seems  FAB-9817|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9817  is related to this bug. In particular, it removes s.Done from GetTxSimulationResults.  ></description> </Issue>

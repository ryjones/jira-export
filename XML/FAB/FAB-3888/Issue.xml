CDATA Currently, the cryptogen's APIs are not able to generate intermediate CA certificates and revocation lists. These two features are useful in general, and in particular to generate MSP configurations to test bad paths.  I have already submitted a change-set at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9275/. It modifies the CA struct to add additional methods to cover the needs described above.   ></description> </Issue>

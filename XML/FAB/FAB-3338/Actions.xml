CDATA  ~davidkhala  - So the issue is that by default, overlay networks created when using Swarm mode do not allow non-Swarm containers to join the network.  You can use the *--attachable* property when using the *network create* command or you can set this in your compose file:   {noformat} networks: mynetwork: driver: overlay attachable: true {noformat}   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Is the goal of this JIRA to run the the services as scalable tasks (for example, define the {{peer}} task, which can then be instantiated {{x}} times on the swarm)?  The comments and attachments so far do not indicate this, but I am asking to clarify, as that is one of the major features of using swarm mode. It seems that we are happy with creating (for example) specific peer tasks (e.g. {{peer1}} , {{peer2}}, {{peer3}}, etc.. ) that are only instantiated only once and hence are never actually scaled automatically by the swarm.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24  thanks for your comment and it does help.  Now my project works as running fabric in swarm mode.  most significant difference is about docker volume, in swarm mode, I take efforts on how to share,distributes crypto-material(MSP, key, cert file) and genesis block files  Finally I use NFS server-client structure, manually create local volume in each nfs-client machine with same name and same content (take mount folder in client machine as content) to support docker service everywhere.  ></body> </Action>

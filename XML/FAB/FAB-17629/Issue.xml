CDATA When running a local build: {code} grep: ./.build/docker/gotools/obj/src/github.com/golang/dep/internal/fs/testdata/symlinks/invalid-symlink: No such file or directory grep: ./.build/docker/gotools/obj/src/github.com/golang/dep/internal/fs/testdata/symlinks/windows-file-symlink: No such file or directory {code}  This implies that the script is traversing hidden directories and the build directory.  The script is also looking explicitly for integration test packages that include {{RunSpecs}} in them. This implies we're looking for ginkgo tests. While ginkgo tests are the majority, they are not the only integration tests. (e.g. common/tools/protolator/integration/integration_test.go) The implication is that there are integration tests excluded by the unit test script that do not execute in the integration test phase.  - The script should not examine hidden directories or the build directory - The script should be looking for integration test packages, not RunSpecs  /cc  ~btl5037   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are 2 solutions to this problem:  1) Instead of using hyperledger/fabric-test-resources, move back to using hyperledger/fabric  This seems to be the cleanest option since we can avoid having to deal with 2 different repos.  2) Modify the chaincode in fabric-test-resources to work with master rather than the convergence branch  This fixes master but then breaks convergence  I am going to go with option 1 because as I have said in other conversations somebody need to solve the chaincode versioning problem if we are going to break the chaincode interface on different releases / branches  ></body> </Action>

CDATA well just for posterity, I realized the obvious error in choosing option 1 - it won't actually appear to be remote code outside of the actual build tree.  So looks like we need to use a different repo (hence the use of fabric-test-resources in the first place), but now we are back to conflict between master and convergence branches.  so looks like we need to minimally have different folders for different example resources for this to work  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24  Create two versions of chaincode_example01 and have TestHTTPExecuteDeployTransaction in the two branches to point to the appropriate one ? That's all we need right ?  On a different note, one thing I don't get.

CDATA  ~muralisr   You are correct in that in the end what we need are different versions of the chaincode implementing the interface(s) appropriate for their branch.   But we REALLY need to come up with a method / convention for how we are going to do this so that these things don't slip through the cracks.    And I will continue to reiterate that we can't keep changing the interface without proper tagging / versioning / etc or creating a template chaincode project which vendors dependencies.   This CONTINUES to be a problem with our lack of releases, tags, etc and what I conider willy / nilly changes (without documenting why in a JIRA entry) to the interface(s) in the first place    ></body> </Action>

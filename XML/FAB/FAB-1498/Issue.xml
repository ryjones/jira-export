CDATA I pulled the latest code of hyperledger and tried to build the peer binary, then following error was met:   	vagrant@hyperledger-devenv:v0.0.10-e3b2d3f:/hyperledger$ make peer  	/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/committer/txvalidator/validator.go:20:2: cannot find package "context" in any of: 		/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/context (vendor tree) 		/opt/go/src/context (from $GOROOT) 		/opt/gopath/src/context (from $GOPATH) 	make: ***  build/bin/peer  Error 1  This is because the Go version fabric depends on is 1.7 and later. Also I found thisin fabric-baseimage, the Golang has been moved to v1.7.3. I met this problem because my local fabric base-image is not updated.  but the dev environment setup guide(fabric/docs/dev-setup/devenv.md) is not updated, which confuses me.  	Prerequisites 	*  Git client (https://git-scm.com/downloads) 	*  Go (https://golang.org/) - 1.6 or later   I suggest update the Go version in devenv.md.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA SatisfiesPrincipal is a function of the MSP that checks if an identity satisifes a given principal.  Principals among other things can be also identity-based, in which case the function should accept if the identity in question matches the msp principal' s identity.  However, for the check to actually make sense one needs to ensure that the identity in the principal is valid under the MSP of the identity of that principal. This is currently not checked.  ></description> </Issue>

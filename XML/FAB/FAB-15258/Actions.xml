CDATA Hi Nilesh - I'm working through the sdk backlogs with the maintainers and came across this. I'm not sure this is a user story, more of a question - have you considered asking on the Hyperledger RocketChat forums? What SDK are you hoping will provide you with this functionality? We think that service discovery will help you, docs here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-overview.html#how-service-discovery-works-in-fabric  ></body> </Action>

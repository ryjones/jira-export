CDATA  ~jyellick  i had a high throughput integration test during development, to ensure that orderer behaves (stop-recover, reconfig, etc) correctly under stress. It is also used for benchmarking purpose.  Although, it was thought to fall into system test bucket, therefore not merged (now abandoned). I personally still think it's valuable test, as normal integration test never actually put orderer under stress (multiple in-flight blocks), *nor did svt tests*. And we actually discovered bug running those tests.  So, IMO we should find a home, if not integration tests suite, for both stress-style integration tests and benchmark tests.  ></body> </Action>

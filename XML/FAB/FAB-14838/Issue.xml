CDATA Recent commit to fix FAB-14735 added an integration end to end test, which doesn't properly treat resources cleanup in case of test failure. Meaning if some of the tests assertion fails it doesn't reaches the code which takes care to stop peers and orderers processes.  These treatment has to be done with {{BeforeEach}} and {{AfterEach}} sections.  ></description> </Issue>

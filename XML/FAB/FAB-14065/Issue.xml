CDATA if {{SnapshotInterval}} is unset, it's default to 0, which means snapshotting is disabled. And raft memory storage will keep growing till OOM.  We should enforce a default value in this case, say 100 or 500 (open for suggestions on actual value)  And ideally, {{SnapshotInterval}} should be the size of accumulated data, instead of number of blocks, as captured in FAB-13656  ></description> </Issue>

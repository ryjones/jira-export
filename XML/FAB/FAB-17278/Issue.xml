CDATA Hi,     Can someone please point me to sample code that will enable me to add a new organization to an existing network/channel using the Node API?  We followed the example fabric-samples org1 and org2. We also followed the  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/channel_update_tutorial.html  to add Org 3.      Now, what we want to know is what are the Fabric Node APIs we can use to accomplish this without having to bring down the network, unlike the example which I have quoted in the link above, which requires a stop and restart.     Thank you  ></description> </Issue>

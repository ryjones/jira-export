CDATA  ~zhangyijie  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6/Setup/TLSSetup.html is all there is in the docs. I suggest either upgrading to v1.0.0-alpha release or inquiring on rocket chat (https://chat.hyperledger.org).   As for any prospect of updating the v0.6 documents, that release has been deprecated so that the community can focus on getting v1.0 released and solid as a rock. Sorry.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To make sure the orderer is properly communicating with the Kakfa cluster, set up debug logging as explained here:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/MAINTAINERS.html  In terms of setting of the Kafka container for logging, you'll need to consult the Kafka product documentation for how to configure the log4j logging provided by Kafka.  I'd also advise that you move to 1.4.2 and Raft rather than using Kafka.  ></body> </Action>

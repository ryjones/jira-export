CDATA I have set up a fabric netowork consisting of 1org: 1CA, 1peer, 1orderer, couchdb.  Now, my approach for setting up kafka-based ordering service was: In the configtx file 1. I made orderer type to kafka. 2. Added a single orderer address (orderer.example.com) 3. Added 4 kafka brokers(kafka0.example.com:9092...)  Then I generated the genesis and channel config files using the above set up in the configtx.  Then I Updated my docker-compose.yaml file to include the kafka and zookeeper containers.  Finally brought up the entire network usingÂ {{docker-compose -f ... up -d}}  The problem is when I submit transactions, I see the orderer logs updating, but no change or update in the kafka logs. Although the orderer shows some kafka related logs like  kafka/consensus .... The kafka logs only update when the kafka broker starts and channel is created etc.  I am confused whether my kafka based ordering is working or is it just working like a solo orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

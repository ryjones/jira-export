<Action id="68728" issue="44712" author="btl5037" type="comment" body="This isn&apos;t a bug, we are aware of this (we were waiting to finish work around the test-network), but as the current `master` branch is going to be tagged as `v2.0.0` the failure doesn&apos;t have any side effects. When it fails you are left on the current master and everything works completely as expected since master will become v2.0.0, this is an error you can ignore in this scenario." created="2020-04-05 02:24:15.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2020-04-05 02:24:27.0"/>

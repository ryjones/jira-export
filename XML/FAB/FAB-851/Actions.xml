CDATA  ~mastersingh24 : We have a sdk-node job to test node-sdk changes only on v0.6 branch from Fabric repository. I have submitted patch to disable sdk-node tests from CI-pipeline. later I realized your request is only to disable node sdk tests on master branch.  Do you want me to disable node-sdk jobs completely from fabric repo or only on master.  FYI: We have a new job created and operational to test fabric-node-sdk changes from fabric-node-sdk repository.    ></body> </Action>

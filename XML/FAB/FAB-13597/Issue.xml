CDATA This is where add all system verification tests (SVT) involving the etcd/raft-based ordering service.  A few guidelines:  # We'll be adding a sub-task per test. # We'll use the "Description" field in the sub-task to describe the test's setup, inputs, and expected outputs in detail. # We'll avoid acronyms as much as possible, and go with descriptions in plain english. # We'll keep logs of both successful and unsuccessful runs around.  Anything that applies to all system verification tests should be recorded in _this_ story.  ></description> </Issue>

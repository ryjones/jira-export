CDATA There is quite a bit of historical context, but originally, channel config was supposed to be specified by some non-existent tool, and so the components were developed under the assumption that this tool would exist.  As the tool did not materialize, these components started hacking more and more pieces together for testing without the tool.  Finally, when it became apparent that there was no tool inbound, {{configtxgen}} was created in its stead, by cobbling together the assorted pieces of testing code from different packages to form a coherent configuration generation binary.  Unfortunately, this evolution of the configtxgen tool means that much of this code is spread throughout the fabric codebase, and in packages which really have nothing to do with bootstrapping or generating new configuration.  Additionally, the underlying configuration structures have changed so much since much of the code was written, that there are unneeded and unhelpful abstractions (like the configuration template concept) which serve only to obfuscate the way configuration is generated.  This story should encompass moving the bits of code from other packages like {{configtx}} and {{channelconfig}} under the  {{configtxgen}} package.  Additionally, the {{provisional}} package should be rewritten to mirror the more recent configuration parsing code, which directly operates on config groups.  ></description> </Issue>

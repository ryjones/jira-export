CDATA The end to end scenarios make use of docker networks for communication between containers but the current version of the client used in master does not contain that level of support.  It appears (from references in our doc) that we're now requiring docker-ce 17.06. That engine version corresponds to API version 1.30.  The v1.0.0 version of the fsouza docker client corresponds with API version 1.23 and contains the support needed for networking.  ></description> </Issue>

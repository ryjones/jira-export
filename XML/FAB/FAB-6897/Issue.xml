CDATA Although we have an implied list of supported OS/platforms it is not documented anywhere. There actually are two lists we should have: the list of target OSes (i.e., images we support) and the list of OSes on which development is supported.  We currently produce images for: Win64, MacOS, Linux x86_64, Linux ppc64le, and Linux s390x  We currently support development on MacOS, and Linux, plus Vagrant over Windows (and Mac?) to a degree.  It would make sense to agree on the actual lists and document them.  ></description> </Issue>

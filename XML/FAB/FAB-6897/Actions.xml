CDATA I should point out that beyond simply setting up the right expectation for the user community out there this should also be communicated to the developer community so that they take that into account when writing code.  Indeed, Go provides system independent functionality for dealing with filesystems and environment variables like PATH that should be consistently used if we want to support Windows as a development platform. Currently parts of the code are clearly written with only Unix in mind, referring to "/tmp" instead of os.TempDir() for instance.  ></body> </Action>

Unfortunately that's definitely not the case. Long gone are the days when vagrant was the preferred development environment. Because most of the core developers aren't using it more and more is done in ways that break on vagrant and I have found it to be a very unreliable platform.  I try to keep an eye and patch what I can when things break but this doesn't appear to be important to the maintainers and this is an ongoing battle.  So, I would not recommend anyone depends on vagrant at this point.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Some thoughts on the key three sections below:  1. For supported OSs.  We need to be explicit that is for building the component binaries -- orderer, peer, ca 2. Development env.    Are developer's still using vagrant? Is this still the direction to take new developers? 3. For Platform specific binaries.  Should we be more explicit and state this is utilities and tooling? (different than component/node binaries)  Should we mention all the docker images we publish daily and for releases? This seems to be more of our direction.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~pandrejko  The Vagrant rationale and decision to use pre-dates my time, I agree we need to settle it.  I've posted in fabric-maintainers to help move this forward.  I'll copy here as well to gather any other feedback:    As we've discussed previously, our documented guidance around using Vagrant or not is inconsistent. We need to clarify the docs once and for all, I think the choices are: 1) recommend to use vagrant 2) recommend not to use vagrant, except in certain scenarios (and still maintain it) 3) recommend not to use vagrant at all (and potentially remove the support) 4) state that it is developer choice and highlight the pros/cons of using vagrant (what are they?) Personally, I’ve just always used vagrant as that was the recommendation when I started, and I’ve had a decent experience with it. Does anybody have strong opinions?       ></body> </Action>

CDATA It is good to document on the prereq and download topics that the server runtimes (peer, orderer, CA) can be run as native binaries (supported platforms mentioned in comments above), but the primary recommendation for Fabric consumers (as opposed to developers) should still be to use docker containers.  As mentioned at  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html#download-platform-specific-binaries  , the docker images are automatically downloaded as part of the download script. Docker images are available for x86-64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.  The correct architecture is automatically detected and downloaded.  Just didn't want the new binary support text to obscure this... most people run the server runtimes as docker containers, but run the other utilities as native binaries (cryptogen, configtxgen, configtxlator, peer CLI, fabric-ca-client).     ></body> </Action>

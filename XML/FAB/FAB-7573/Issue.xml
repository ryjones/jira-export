CDATA Allowing concurrent access to invokes and init in 1.0 allowed all the 0.6 separation of Query, Invoke and Init to be vastly simplified (in 0.6 Queries were allowed concurrent access but not others).   This also implied that the FSM can be removed completely which was done in FAB-5424. This task completes the work with the following * change names of functions to not have "FSM" flavor (they now have "handler" flavor) in core/chaincode/handler.go * chaincode and peer calls driven by function handlers * comment and sundry cleanup  This was tested as follows * peer and shim chaincode UT * destructive testing by killing peer and chaincode at different points of the lifecycle * running against a java chaincode to prove the two sides are independent and shims can be worked upon independent of peer chaincode support side  ></description> </Issue>

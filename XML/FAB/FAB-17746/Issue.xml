CDATA As a consumer of the fabric API, I would like to reference msp related types in a separate namespace from configtx. Currently a consumer would pass a configtx.MSP type which has configtx.CryptoConfig, configtx.NodeOUs, etc properties. The subproperty types should be moved to a separate membership package within the configtx library such that they can be referenced as membership.CryptoConfig, membership.NodeOUs, etc. Note this story is only for namespacing the types, no functions should be moved unless deemed necessary/more appropriate to live in the membership subpackage.  Â   *Acceptance*  I can find a new membership folder/package within the configtx package that contains the msp related types for SigningIdentityInfo, OUIdentifier, CryptoConfig, NodeOUs,. The new Orderer package should be well documented/have a well formed GoDoc.  ></description> </Issue>

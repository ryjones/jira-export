CDATA Currently, the validator behaves very poorly when it comes to unmarshalling: the same field is unmarshalled multiple times in the same code path leading to code that is inefficient and hard to maintain.   This JIRA tracks the work required to unmarshal once all the struct out of a block and then pass around to all validating functions a reference to a struct with appropriate getters.  ></description> </Issue>

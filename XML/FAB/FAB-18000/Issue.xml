CDATA The operator tool should have the ability to send Invokes directly to the peer using the GoSDK and should not have to cede control to the Node.js implementation of PTE.  Implement an event listener, this should be registered on the transaction and is used to determine how many transactions were successful, as well as a gate for determining when to send the next transaction.  The logic should support the ability to send transactions in two manners: * Load ** This should send transactions as fast as possible * Constant ** This should accept a duration in milliseconds, which is the time between sending successive transactions ** It should also accept a "deviation" value, which is the range of the first standard deviation from the duration mentioned above. The transactions will be sent at some interval in this range randomly.  We should also support the following targets for execution: * All ** Submit transactions to all peers * Target ** Send to a predefined list of peers * Org ** Send to all peers in an org * Anchor ** Send to the first peer in each org in the connection profile (which has been configured by the operator as the anchor peer) * Service Discovery ** Enable service discovery for submitting transactions  ></description> </Issue>

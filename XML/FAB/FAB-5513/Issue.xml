CDATA Firstly, We yet to evaluate Hyperledger v1.0  Before that, in the v0.6, any version changes to the golang chain-code generates the new chain-code id and creates an another network ledger.  Due to that, our application querying on the ledger, couldn't find the references of the existing data in new ledger.  Don't know, how to handle these versioning of chain-code.  Is there any provision to append the older data to the new ledger/ to the underlying DB to query?  Â   Thanks,  Mahendran..  ></description> </Issue>

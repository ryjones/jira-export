CDATA The goal of this track of work is to produce a consumable API/library that can be imported and used for modifying existing config transactions and generating a config update. An example use case could be a consumer building a CLI for translating desired config parameter updates passed via flags to the imported library, something along the lines of {{configtx update current_config.pb --addAnchorPeer host1:123 --org Org1}} which could pass the desired anchor peer down to the config library's AddAnchorPeer function to add the new anchor peer and then call ComputeConfigUpdate to generate the config update envelope returned via the CLI.  Currently users need to follow steps similar to those found in  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/config_update.html#editing-a-config  which largely revolves around having the user decode the channel transaction to JSON and then manually updating properties prior to re-encoding and then submitting the update. This library is intended to be lightweight and only use minimal dependencies.  ></description> </Issue>

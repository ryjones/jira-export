CDATA Snapshot the blockchain state so that peers can join a channel from a checkpointed state, and reduce the amount of space and time required to maintain a ledger.     *Motivations* * Ability to join a peer to a channel from a checkpointed state rather than from genesis block, so that latest channel configuration can be used (e.g. latest orderer endpoints and org MSP certificates). * Reduce the amount of time to join a new peer to a channel * Reduce the amount of storage space required for a channel * Ensure that peer state databases are in sync     Note, this Epic is independent but related to 'pruning' a channel's blocks.   That is, once a channel has been snapshotted and peers can bootstrap from the snapshot, it would be safe to prune blocks prior to the snapshot.  ></description> </Issue>

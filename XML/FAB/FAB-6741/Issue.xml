CDATA The gossip channel metadata serializes a uint64 that specifies the ledger height. It's not extensible since it's not proto or anything of the sort.'  In v1.1 we extended the stateInfo message with a new field called properties which is a proto field and is extensible.   Now, for v1.2 it is time to deprecate the old metadata and use only the Properties.  As a result, peers in v1.0 won't be able to speak in channel context with peers in v1.2 onwards.  ></description> </Issue>

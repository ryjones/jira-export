<Action id="30704" issue="20025" author="shanlusun" type="comment" body="This is a really important issue now, we got problems on remote peers(Other organizations) which lose connection to Orderer many times. We always need to restart the broken peers again and again to rejoin channel and connect to Orderer. Without a stable network, we can&apos;t release a real production. Please help to fix this as soon as possible." created="2017-09-11 02:35:48.0" updateauthor="shanlusun" updated="2017-09-11 02:35:48.0"/>

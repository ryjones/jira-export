CDATA Docker container are by default created or launched to use UTC timezone. Peer and Orderer timezone can be controlled by volume mounting to use the host timezone.      volumes:       - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro  Other option can be the docker-environment variable TZ however our understanding this requires package upgrade for both host and docker-image.  Using the volume mount option, we were able to change the timezone of the Peer however whenever the chaincode container is spin-off, this still runs on the UTC timezone.  Use Case: Our system is all configured with the reference data (time component) to a particular timezone (not UTC).  ></description> </Issue>

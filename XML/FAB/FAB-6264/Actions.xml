CDATA hi  ~manxiaqu ,  ~baohua  do you guys think this PR is ready to use? we where following this ticket because we wanted mongoDB because it has better geospatial support then couchDB. So it would be really cool if we could start using this and maybe help improving it ... what do you guys think?  Will the querying work the same as for couchDB?  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="34608" issue="20957" author="manxiaqu" type="comment" body="hi,  #Daan Poron , up to now, the mongo statedb have been test for its&apos; all function and performance using 1 orderer, 1 peer, 1 cli and 1 mongodb(docker). And the mongodb container of docker down for some times when the amount of data is near 5,000,000. And It will work again when you start the container of mongodb. The reason haven&apos;t been found yet(also happened when using other statedb). The normal situation for using it, I think is ok. But there is still some place need to optimization like retry and so on. So maybe it&apos;s better using it in a real project after review." created="2017-11-14 06:59:36.0" updateauthor="manxiaqu" updated="2017-11-14 06:59:36.0"/>

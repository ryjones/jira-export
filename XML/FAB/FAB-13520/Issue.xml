CDATA The ledger was updated to rather than directly interrogate collections definitions from the lscc table, to instead delegate to an injected dependency which returns collection information based on changes to the world state.  This story is to have the existing lifecycle implement this interface so that it can be used (in time) to provide collection information to the ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I'm using 2.0 fabric in which plugins feature is disabled. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15338  I cloned fabric, added my scc to pkg/core/scc/mycc and registered it in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/internal/peer/node/start.go#L730 and whitelisted in core.yaml. I see peer accepted it and deployed. When I try to call it using go sdk I get `returned error: lscc's state for  mycc  not found` in peer's logs and invalid transaction.  1.4 validator is used. My first thoughts were that it tries to Invoke system cc using standard lscc lifecycle, not system one. which is not right.  Also, I found this issue, maybe this is related somehow, but there are a lot of changes from 1.0 to 2.0 https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5671  importsysccs.go is not there anymore. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/350/files this documentation is not clear.   https://pastebin.com/DsJ5G8k5 logs from the peer  Mycc is very similar to _lifecycle in a way that I stores votes(approvals) for channel governance  ></description> </Issue>

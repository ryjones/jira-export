CDATA If a node is disconnected from cluster, every failed RPC call (in particular, {{Step}} for heartbeats) produces an error message, which pollute logs on both connected & disconnected nodes. We probably should devise a mechanism to log once for all.  Another case should be taken care of is that when a new node is catching up with the others, RPC calls to a channel created during its absence also produce fairly amount of logs, because this channel is missing on this newly connected node, until it applies the channel creation config block.  ></description> </Issue>

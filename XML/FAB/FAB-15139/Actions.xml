CDATA Is there something to enable on the build to run on fixed packages, to keep them fixed? I'd be willing to make the cleanup happen if we can enforce it to stay cleaned up.     There's a lot of ` error strings should not be capitalized (ST1005)` which makes me think it's a very common 'mistake' but hardly something that could be considered a hard error.     On master dd8961c95bba5161cda63e208f4f10770ef44212  $ staticcheck ./... > staticcheck.txt  $ wc -l staticcheck.txt 1077 staticcheck.txt  $ grep 'error strings should not be capitalized (ST1005)' staticcheck.txt | wc -l 429    About 40% are capitalization issues. Probably masking deeper issues.  ></body> </Action>

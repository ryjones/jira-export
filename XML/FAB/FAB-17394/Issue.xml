CDATA Currently each fabric implementation aims to meet the same schema although the tests they run use schemas located locally to them and there is no means of ensuring the schemas are in sync. This test would ensure they are.  The test will check the metadata produced matches the schema and perform basic checks. Since the implementations won't perform the exact same output (e.g. Go won't create parameter names) the exact output won't be checked.  ></description> </Issue>

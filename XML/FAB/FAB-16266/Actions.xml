CDATA The NODE in the testcase titles refers to the chaincode language. These tests use fabric-samples/chaincode/marbles02/node. Looking in that repo now, it appears that cc no longer exists at that location.  The same test scenarios are also executed with golang chaincode. The cc language is not important, so we can disable these tests that are trying to use node version of marbles02.  ></body> </Action>

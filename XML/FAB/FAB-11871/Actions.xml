<Action id="50165" issue="33510" author="manish-sethi" type="comment" body="As far as ledger code is concerned, the response should not matter as long as correct ledger instance (for the channel) is used and the correct chaincode name is passed. My wild guess would be that somewhere in chaincode-&gt;chaincode call on different channels, one of the names being passed down may be incorrect. To verify his hypothesis further,  ~Rachit_gaur  can you attach the debug logs for both the scenarios (the scenario that works for you when both the chainocdes are on same channel and the scenario that does not work for you when both the chaincodes are on different channels)?" created="2018-09-10 15:18:31.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2018-09-10 15:18:46.0"/>

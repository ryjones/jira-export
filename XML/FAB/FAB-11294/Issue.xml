CDATA *Acceptance*: A fabric client can be built to submit a “list tokens” query to a peer. Peer considers the current ledger state and returns the tokens owned by the  creator of the query; if the creator of the query does not have permission to read the channel’s data, the request is rejected; if the creator of the query does not own any tokens the peer would return an empty list. The client can observe the correctness of successive “list my tokens” queries in correlation with the content of the ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

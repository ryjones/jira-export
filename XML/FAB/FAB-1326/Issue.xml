CDATA This epic includes two groups of issues mainly given that a BCCSP factory has already been built in nodejs:  1) building a BCCSP for PKCS11 (leveraging the nodejs P11 bindings) 2) ensuring that crypto calls within the client infrastrucure are all routed through the BCCSP  Item (2) we can do in two steps:  2.1) refactor the code in the client to expose an application MSP interface as the one defined in FAB- ..., and 2.2.) enforce that the refactored code's crypto operations leverage BCCSP      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Following code review, it was decided to move the "follower" package from orderer/consensus/follower to orderer/common/follower.  The follower.Chain no longer implements consenus.Chain and is not treated as a consensus plug-in.  Instead of a consensus.Consenter implemeting `JoinChain`, the registrar creates a follower.Chain and saves it in a separate map from consensus.Chain implementations. Since the follower is not in the chains map of the registrar, it is not found by broadcast requests until it turns into an etcdraft.Chain.  Interface consensus.Consenter now defines a new interface `IsChannelMember` that allows the registrar to detect whether a join-block implies the orderer is a member or follower of the channel.  ></description> </Issue>

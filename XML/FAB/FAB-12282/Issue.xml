For e.g., if the CouchDB is used as the stateDB, we would end up storing all system state in the CouchDB. As a result, the performance is significantly affected as the CouchDB is accessed over HTTPS. If we use GoLevelDB to store the system state and reduce the usage of external store such as CouchDB, the performance could be improved." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-10-03 12:06:17.0" updated="2020-01-22 22:31:10.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:31:10.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="45716"/>

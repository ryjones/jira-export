CDATA  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/31417/   Final refactor. Redid the entire lockbasedtxmgr package to reuse the same DB. One container vs. more than 30. Going to look at how much further I can reduce the number of couch instances we use by package. Increasing the timeout won't effect us as much anymore, as we only need to wait for one container now, instead of 30, so if we do have a timeout on the Couch startup, we will get it up front, rather than on the 30th startup.  Side effect unit tests go from 400 seconds to complete in the package, to 100 seconds total  ></body> </Action>

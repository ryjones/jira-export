CDATA  ~C0rWin  ~binhn  ~ellaki  ~ales  To consolidate such things, we need: 1. Identify where the hash is used, 2. Decide what it means to have that specific hash function there.   This is important to understand where the configuration is taken from. We cannot use the same hash function everywhere because it depends on the context.  For example, hash functions are used for the ledger, for the endorsement, to compute digest to be signed and so. Let's consider the case of signing a message. If we use ECDSA with curve P256 we cannot use SHA-128 or SHA-384, we have to use SHA-256. This should be taken care by the local MSP configuration, for example.  I think we need a call here to clarify these aspects :)     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Much of what is in fabric/core/peer are functions that rely on package level state that effectively becomes a singleton. This prevents explicit configuration and instantiation of peer as a dependency of other objects in the system.  The first step to addressing this is to create an interface that represents Peer and create an implementation that delegates to the existing package level functions. This instance will then be wired in to satisfy external component dependencies. When the wiring is complete. the peer will be refactored to support configuration, instantiation, and test without the use of package level variables.  ></description> </Issue>

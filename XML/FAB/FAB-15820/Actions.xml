CDATA I won't pretend to know much about the SDK implementation, so definitely double-check and keep me honest here.  From looking at that CR, it looks like QueryChaincodeDefinition (singular) and GetInstalledChaincodePackage haven't been implemented yet.   As far as the additional info returned in queries, I guess the SDK just returns the entire response that it receives from the server? If that's the case, then the other changes should be covered now that the lifecycle protos are current.  ></body> </Action>

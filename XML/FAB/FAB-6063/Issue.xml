CDATA In gossip, we only increment the logical timestamp of stateInfo messages (channel metadata broadcast) when a change occurs (i.e ledger height increased).  Because of this - we cannot expire (on a timely basis) a StateInfo message of another peer as long as it's in the membership view, else if the channel doesn't have any activity - all peers would expire all other peer's channel metadata and no peer would recognize other peers as being in the channel.  To implement a leave channel capability, we need to add a flag that makes the peer actively ignore the given StateInfo message.     ~C0rWin   ></description> </Issue>

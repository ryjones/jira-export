CDATA The PEM certificate of an anchor peer that is serialized into a configuration block is converted to a serialized identity by using the raw bytes of the PEM but also a default string that represents the MSP ID.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5123/ is going to replace the local MSP's id which is always DEFAULT to a string configured in core.yaml.  Therefore, in order for peers to be able to validate certificates of anchor peers, we need to add the MSP-ID (will be called in the CLI "organization ID" to conform with the most common use-case) into the anchor peers and also into the CLI command that generates the genesis block.  ></description> </Issue>

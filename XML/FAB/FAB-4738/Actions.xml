CDATA I actually don't think you have to set GOROOT, if I'm right, it's auto discovered. In fact, mine is blank:  Marks:fabric mark$ echo $GOROOT  Marks:fabric mark$   ~jeffgarratt  is this something special / different for behave?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Right if you install Go in the standard location (e.g. /usr/local/go for the binary distribution in golang.org).  I thought we still have to set GOROOT because (1) one might install Go in a different location from the standard one (2) behave fails as reported above  While now I think (2) is due to some bug in the peer code which should be addressed (I opened FAB-4819), I still think it needs to be set because of (1).   ></body> </Action>

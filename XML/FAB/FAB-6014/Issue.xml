CDATA    CUSTOM, a new chaincode spec which cannot be packaged or installed remotely. And can only be installed manually by admin inside peer.   Admin will package this chaincode spec by using own custom packager and will place the deployment spec directly in chaincode path inside peer in ‘<CHAINCODE NAME>.<VERSION>’ format.  Running ‘peer chaincode instantiate’ after that on peer will initialize the chaincode.   peer chaincode instantiate -n example-custom-cc -v 0 -c '\{"Args": "a","10" }' -C mychannel     Any attempt to install/package remotely will not produce deployment spec with code package and peer is always forced to check chaincode path for code package during instantiation.   _+For Admins:+_ Code package inside deployment spec should be tar of files which will be placed directly inside chaincode container without any compilation or processing in between.           ></description> </Issue>

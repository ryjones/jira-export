CDATA I have created network with two organizations Org1 and Org2 with 3 orderers.  Fabric Version v2.2.1  used statedb as couchdb:3.1  Each organization is having two peers and all 4 peers of two organizations has joined in common channel(test-channel)  After performing transactions on test-channel, peer1 org1 couchdb has less number of records when compared with peer2 org1 couchdb. This is creating major issue while querying records from peer1org1.     Kindly help in resolving the issue.  I tried resyncing the peer1org1 by removing persistent data. still i am unable to sync all the records to couchdb.  NOTE: The ledger height on all 4 peers are same.     ></description> </Issue>

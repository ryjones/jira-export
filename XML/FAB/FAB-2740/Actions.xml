CDATA This actually does end up being "atomic" :  1) Chaincode execution only simulates the result and then produces a read/write set which is returned to the client in the proposal response  2) The client then sends the endorsed proposal as a transaction to the ordering service  3) Ordering service delivers the transaction (in a batch) to the peer(s)  4) Peers run validation logic and then commit the entire transaction (i.e. the write set)  Therefore since both "writes" are part of the same transaction this is effectively "atomic"  Going to mark as DONE.   ~mdozturk  Please add any additional comments / questions if I am misunderstanding what you are asking  ></body> </Action>

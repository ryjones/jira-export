CDATA example02 imitates a payment, where the app decreses A's value and increases B's value by the same amount. Invoke does some error checking, loads A, loads B, decreases A by X and increases B by X. Saves A. Saves B.  The problem with the current code is that the two save actions are not atomic: save to A could succeed and the save to B could fail. The code should be updated to make the save atomic, either they both happen or neither happens.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Actually, assuming * that the validator/committer code path validates block signatures (sequentially, after the previous block was validated and committed); and * that we are running with a CFT orderer then I believe there is no attack. The gossip layer may also validate block signatures factoring in reconfigurations as Yacov suggests, but as long as the validator/committer does it, we're good.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Agreed, blocks should/must be validated only after all previous blocks have been validated (and if a config block, committed).  This solves the problem for all cases.  As a side note, I think this would also be a good time to validate the blocks chain.  Since the orderers sign blocks, and will not sign an incorrect block, validating the hash chain is redundant.  However, it's still a good idea to ensure that there's not been some fork due to an error in ordering.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Images such as couchdb, zookeeper, and kafka were moved to the fabric-baseimage repo.  However, the "make docker-thirdparty" target still utilizes DOCKER_NS rather than BASE_DOCKER_NS.  This works fine with defaults, but breaks if the user tries to work with hyperledger using non-standard namespaces.  The solution is that docker-thirdparty should use BASE_DOCKER_NS so that they correctly track the rest of baseimage base images.  ></description> </Issue>

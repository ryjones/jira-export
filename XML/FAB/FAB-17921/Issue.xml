CDATA Currently there is a non-deterministic db name collision between metadataDB and namespaceDB with namespace="".Â  * When channel name is not truncated, metadataDB and namespaceDB with namespace="" have the same db name. * When channel name is truncated, these two DBs have different db names.  Ideally metadataDB and namespaceDB should not have same name. In a future release, we may rename metadataDB and migrate the content to avoid the name collision.  ></description> </Issue>

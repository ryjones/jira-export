CDATA The same should actually hold true for all config files used by the system.   Of course eventually certain parts of the config should probably be stored on the blockchain itself (via some type of system chaincode)    ></body> </Action>

CDATA It's possible to specify *peer* config file path by means of environment variable "PEER_CFG_PATH". We could take same approach for membersrvc or it might be better just to use a flag instead  I've also found it necesary in order to remove test users from base yaml file and let them be specified within the scope of behave tests.  I could implement this minor feature if that's ok  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jeroiraz  Yes, I think this minor improvement will be major for FAB-110. Let's pair on this, if you like. I promised/planned to finish/submit it today.   ~grapebaba  Wanted to help with separating the test data FAB-15. Yes, we would like the tests to specify the configuration file (as part of the tests), happy to split these (mainly because it takes forever to run these tests!)  Happy to take the pragmatic approach that  ~mastersingh24  suggests and have a quick improvement round, get to the clean the conf files first, and then revisit later if needed.  ></body> </Action>

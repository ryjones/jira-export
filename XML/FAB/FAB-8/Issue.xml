CDATA Currently, when the {{membersrvc}} binary is called, it expects a/the hardcoded `membersrvc.yaml` file.  I believe that it will be a lot easier both for *deployments* but certainly for *development* and *testing* if one is able to specify (dynamically, when executing/running/launching {{membersrvc}}) a location for the YAML file to use.  I can also see how this can help others when *reporting issues* (as one can simply upload the configuration file as part of the information needed for reproducing an issue/bug).    ></description> </Issue>

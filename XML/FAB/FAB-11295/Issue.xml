CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client submits a query providing the transfer request’s details (i.e., identifiers of tokens to be issued, and expected recipients). The peer is to consult the  current state of the ledger to retrieve the details of the tokens that are to be transferred, and  assess if they exist, have not been spent, and  if the inputs match the quantity of the intended  outputs, i.e., suffice for accommodating the full set of tokens transferred to all the specified  recipients. If any of these conditions is not met, the peer rejects; otherwise it returns to the  client a transfer proof.  The peer responds with a transfer proof  that matches the requester’s parameters.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently a fabric-cli plugin is defined as an executable which is wrapped by a cobra command. This has its limitations in that custom flags for the command are ignored and long descriptions and examples cannot be provided.  The fabric-cli plugin mechanism should also recognize commands that are defined using Go plugins. A Go plugin can return a full cobra sub-command which provides all of the features mentioned above.  ></description> </Issue>

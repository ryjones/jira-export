CDATA Repeat FAB-13856, with these differences:  In SETUP section, create two channels, each with 10,000 blocks, instead of just one.  In the INPUTS section, Step 3:  * After starting up orderer4: watch as it pulls the blocks for one channel. It could take more than 2 minutes to complete that, and then start pulling blocks for the other application channel (before it finally does the systemchannel). * After about 3 minutes, AFTER it completes the first channel AND WHILE still pulling blocks for second channel: ## Stop and restart the new orderer4 ## After it appears the orderer completes the onboarding process (by looking at logs and metrics), send transactions on both channels to confirm functionality.  Variation: Repeat the test, but this time start traffic running on both channels (submitting transactions to the existing orderers - not the onboarding orderer) before/during/after restarting the onboarding orderer. (Refer also to similar testcase FAB-13702 for dynamic onboarding with traffic, and FAB-14047 for dynamic onboarding with traffic plus restart.)  ></description> </Issue>

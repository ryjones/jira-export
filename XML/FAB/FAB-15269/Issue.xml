CDATA Due to the way the lscc's ccprovider package parses installed chaincodes (simply splitting the name at the first period and then attempting to unmarshal the file into a ChaincodeDeploymentSpec), the call to list all installed chaincodes will fail when lscc and _lifecycle chaincode install packages exist in the folder on the peer.  Since we cannot change the location of the lscc installed chaincodes due to compatibility issues, we should store _lifecycle chaincodes in a new folder. The current thought is to use {code:java} <peer.fileSystemPath>/lifecycle/chaincodes {code}  ></description> </Issue>

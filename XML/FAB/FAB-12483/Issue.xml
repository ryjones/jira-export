CDATA This task is a place holder for cleaning up ledger code The intention is to create sub-tasks for each specific item. Some of the high level items include the following...  1. Remove ledgermgmt singleton - FAB-15755 2. For tests, take root folder from a central place that returns the folder based in the package name 3. Move integration tests from txmgmt package to kvledger/tests 4. Move integration tests from validation package to kvledger/tests 5. Move pvtdata batch preparation outside validation package 6. Rework update batches in privacyenabled state for a better coherency between three types of batches 7. Rework query iterators to return concrete type 8. Cleanup initialization of ledger and passing down dependencies 9. Define types that are used all over at some common place (e.g., composite key) 10. Get rid of ledgerconfig module - DONE IN FAB-15086  ></description> </Issue>

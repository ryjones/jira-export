CDATA Hi  ~ChristopherFerris ,  So it was classified by us indeed as a bug, but a security bug to be more precise.  The reason for this check is to always ensure that the instantiation policy of an instantiated chaincode on the chain is respected. This check is already done when a chaincode is invoked directly by a proposal, and needs to be extended for the chaincode to chaincode case. In this sense the change is not that invasive.  We believe this bug needs to be addressed, otherwise an attacker could bypass the instantiation policy of a chaincode.   If you still think we should classify it as an improvement I could change the issue's type.   ></body> </Action>

As the previous item (3156) this may look like an enhancement but is actually a fix of a design flaw that leads to a security vulnerability.   ></body> </Action>

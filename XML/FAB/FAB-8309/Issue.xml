CDATA When two config updates (with same conditions such as changing batch size in both) are sent to the orderer at the same time using orderer org admin, the cli logs show no error message even though one of the transactions gets discarded by the orderer. The error can be seen in the orderer logs as: Discarding bad config message: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: attempt to set key  Value   /Channel/Orderer/BatchSize to version 1, but key is at version 1  The same test scenario if done with different conditions such as changing batch size and changing batch timeout passes successfully and two config blocks are created.  This might create a confusion that both the config updates passed successfully.  Please refer to the attached screenshots to see the command that was used to send in the config update and the the error message in the orderer logs.  ></description> </Issue>

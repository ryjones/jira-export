CDATA The current configtx scheme is a collection of signed configuration items.  This has the benefit of being very flexible, allowing a submitter to collect signatures from one set of parties for one set of items, a second set of signatures from a second set of parties for a second set of items, and then glue them together, and submit a valid reconfiguration.  However, this flexibility comes at the expense of requiring more signatures, and the added complexity does not seem worth the added flexibility.  This CR moves the signatures to the envelope level, but maintains the per item policy evaluation.  ></description> </Issue>

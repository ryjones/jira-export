CDATA Currently, the indexes are created using the CURL command to couch-db and this becomes not easy to scale where the channel count can shoot to hundreds.  There is need to have SHIM interface that can create index in user-chain-code. This needs to be thought how more indexes can be added (should it be done by user-chain code upgrade?).      ></description> </Issue>

I want to know if there is any way to constantly check the readiness of nodes. Right after they&apos;re ready to accept transactions, I want to create a channel and join peers. I checked orderers&apos; logs but I can&apos;t find a way to automate the process. I also looked at Prometheus metrics. Apparently in Fabric v2.0 there is a way to check active nodes in the channel by reading consensus_etcdraft_active_nodes info from orderer&apos;s exporter but this isn&apos;t the case in Fabric v1.4.6.Â " priority="1" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2020-04-13 15:26:44.0" updated="2021-08-31 05:11:46.0" resolutiondate="2021-04-16 19:24:22.0" votes="1" watches="6" workflowId="58764" archived="N"/>

CDATA This is not a consistent failure (or passing) of this test. At this point, it is every other test that passes and fails (i.e. Job#26:passed; #27:failed; #28:passed; #29:failed...)  !Screen Shot 2019-01-17 at 5.07.49 PM.png|thumbnail!   The execution time of this specific test is 4 min, 39 seconds.  !Screen Shot 2019-01-17 at 5.08.26 PM.png|thumbnail!   It's also worth noting for triage purposes that this error occurs with the java SDK/node chaincode combination. The other chaincode shims seem to work pretty consistently with the JavaSDK.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm also keen to see a fix for this. If you use docker run to look inside the fabric-ccenv image and go to "/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/" you can see the shim directory is there but lib is not. If anyone has suggestions for a workaround that would be great.        ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is actually by design. The cid pkg is provided as a convenience today and is intended to be vendored by chaincode. We are adding additional identity types (e.g. Identity Mixer credentials) and have not yet come up with the final set of APIs we would consider including natively within chaincode  ></body> </Action>

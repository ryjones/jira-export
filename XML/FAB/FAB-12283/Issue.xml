CDATA For every Get/Put call from the chaincode, we do need to a GRPC call between the client and peer and then between the peer and stateDB. These operations becomes costlier especially when CouchDB is used as the stateDB. We should add new chaincode APIs such as GetMultipleStates() and PutMultipleStates() so that we can utilize the CouchDB bulk read/write operations.   Both stateDBs already implement GetMultipleKeys() and SetMultipleKeys(). However, the couchDB implementation does not use bulk read API in GetMultipleKeys().   ></description> </Issue>

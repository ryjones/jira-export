CDATA create a network with 3 OSNs, Start 2 and create a channel, push a few normal transactions, do a config change as well to make the last config block.number>0. Start the 3rd OSN (to create the filerepo). Shut it down.  Emulating a failure in the 3rd OSN Join sequence:  Scenario 1: failure after the join block is is written to the filerepo but before block pulling starts. Put the the last config block taken from OSN1 in the filerepo/joinblock folder of OSN3. Restart OSN3 and check onboarding proceeds as expected.  Scenario 2: failure after the join block is is written to the filerepo, ledger folder created, but before block pulling starts. Put the the last config block taken from OSN1 in the filerepo/joinblock folder of OSN3. Create the channel folder in the ledger. Restart OSN3 and check onboarding proceeds as expected.  Scenario 3: failure after the block puling starts, but before reaching the join-block. Put the the last config block taken from OSN1 in the filerepo/joinblock folder of OSN3. Create the ledger and place the genesis block in it. Restart OSN3 and check onboarding proceeds as expected.     ></description> </Issue>

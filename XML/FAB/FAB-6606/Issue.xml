CDATA In balance-transfer, a function call “getOrgAdmin(org)” outputs incorrect user name in error message.  The following functions are executed by Admin due to access control. - createChannel - JoinChannel - installChaincode - instantiateChaincode - getInstalledChaincodes  In these functions, helper.getOrgAdmin(org) is called to get enrollment for Admins. However, non-admin user name is printed out in error messages if getOrgAdmin(org) fails. Error messages should be modified to show that enrolling Admin fails.  This is an example. {code:java} return helper.getOrgAdmin(org).then((user) => { // read the config block from the orderer for the channel // and initialize the verify MSPs based on the participating // organizations return channel.initialize(); }, (err) => { logger.error('Failed to enroll user \'' + username + '\'. ' + err); throw new Error('Failed to enroll user \'' + username + '\'. ' + err); {code}  In addition, an arg "username" is not used in functions above because caller name is assigned base on org name. To make it easy to understand the code structure, the arg "username" should be removed.   ></description> </Issue>

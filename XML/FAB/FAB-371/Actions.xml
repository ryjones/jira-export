CDATA I worked with the sarama mocks package today and stubbed our the mocks for all of the relevant structures in the kafka-orderer package. I did some refactoring to allow for easier testing. As a result of today's rewriting, the code _should_ be testable at any level.  To clarify what this means: Imagine that at the top level you have a Server struct, which carries a Broadcaster and a Deliverer. On the second level, the Broadcaster encompasses a Producer, and the Deliverer encompasses multiple Client-Deliverers  (as the name implies, we have one per client.) On the third level, the Client-Deliverer encompasses a Consumer.  If you want to test the Deliverer's functionality, you can call MockNewDeliverer() and you'll get an object of type Deliverer that you can test out. If you want to dive deeper, you can test out  a Client-Deliverer by calling MockNewClientDeliverer(), etc.  ></body> </Action>

It slows things down and this is probably what caused the failure.  ~wlahti  Any idea why? I thought you did that change back then that makes all our logs in CI run with WARN?  ></body> </Action>

I see the call to gossip&apos;s util.SetupTestLogging() but it definitely appears to be using DEBUG instead of WARNING.

CDATA I tried pushing a CR with a gossip/election test change that always fails in order to simulate the behavior and to look at the log level, but it's definitely WARNING. I'm not sure what may have caused this but I don't see the issue in any recent CRs.   ~aambati  Can you take a look and consider marking this item complete if you agree that the issue no longer exists?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The answer to what's causing it to use the DEBUG log level is easy. Check out the first lines of code in TestLeaderElectionWithRealGossip: {code:java} logging.SetLevel(logging.DEBUG, util.LoggingElectionModule) logging.SetLevel(logging.DEBUG, util.LoggingServiceModule){code} It was added via:  FAB-2576  Fix LE and gossip integration test  ></body> </Action>

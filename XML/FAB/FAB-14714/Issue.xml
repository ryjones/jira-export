CDATA It is currently unsafe to remove node from 2-node cluster. Because if the node being removed is leader, Raft protocol requires it to remain connected and coordinate the commitment of this config change, even after restart. However, in current etcdraft implementation, Chain won't start if it cannot find itself among consenters. For more details, see Raft thesis 4.2.2  This requires orderer bootstrap logic to be changed considerably and we could defer it to v2  ></description> </Issue>

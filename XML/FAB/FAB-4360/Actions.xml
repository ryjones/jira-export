CDATA I think the problem is actually here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/generateArtifacts.sh#L66  since it checks to see if configtxgen actually exists and if it does it will not try to (re)build it.  There is a make target called *release-clean* but it does not get called by the *clean* target.  So how do we want to proceed here?   Perhaps we should simple add *release-clean* to *clean* ?   ~yacovm  - what do you think?     ></body> </Action>

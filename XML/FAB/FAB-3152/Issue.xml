CDATA h1. Issue I've seen this issue in versions from the v1.0.0-alpha to the latest master code: launching the peer in production mode in the Vagrant VM, it can't find the orderer. I get errors like this:  bq. 2017-04-13 19:04:31.566 UTC  ConnProducer  NewConnection -> ERRO 038 Failed connecting to orderer:7050 , error: grpc: timed out when dialing bq. 2017-04-13 19:04:31.566 UTC  deliveryClient  connect -> ERRO 039 Failed obtaining connection: Could not connect to any of the endpoints:  orderer:7050   It seems that it's using the host name "orderer" which isn't set up in the VM; once I add it to the VM's /etc/hosts pointing to 127.0.0.1 the error goes away.  (solution found on this StackOverflow post:  http://stackoverflow.com/a/42971813|http://stackoverflow.com/a/42971813 )  This affects the peer's deployment of chaincode.  h1. Reproduction * Download the latest code * Start the VM, and inside: * Compile the peer with `make` -- the behave target always fails for me * Run the orderer in one terminal * Run  `peer node start` in another terminal  Observe the error(s) in the peer's output.  ></description> </Issue>

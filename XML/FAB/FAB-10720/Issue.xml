CDATA As part of the new lifecycle work, there is a new chaincode package format as defined via FAB-10719.  In order for the new life cycle to use this new package format, it needs a way to persist these code packages.  The existing persistence is done through the ccprovider package, however, because of the legacy and problematic nature of this code (package scoped state and functions), and the irrelevant details like instantiation policy, extending the existing mechanisms is likely to be more work than simply creating a new persistence system.  This new persistence should take as a parameter a name, a version, and a set of bytes.  This set of bytes is a marshaled form of the the new message from FAB-10719.  The persistence should use the existing configurable chaincode storage directory to store chaincodes, but instead of storing them as '<name>.<version>' as the current code does, it should store the marshaled package and the package name/version as {{<hash_of_chaincode_install_package>.bin}} and {{<hash_of_chaincode_install_package>.json}} respectively.  The implementation should be careful not to expose these details to the user.  The implementer should evaluate whether creating a new file in the ccprovider package, or simply creating a new package is more sensible for this work.  ></description> </Issue>

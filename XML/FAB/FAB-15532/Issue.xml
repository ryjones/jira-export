CDATA In orderer IT, we often need to broadcast *normal* transactions to Orderer. This is currently done by performing a full Fabric tx flow, which requires heavy dependencies, esp. building/starting chiancode, and it significantly slows down the overall runtime.  Instead, we should create in-proc Orderer clients to broadcast mock TXs and remove peers from Orderer-specific tests.  ></description> </Issue>

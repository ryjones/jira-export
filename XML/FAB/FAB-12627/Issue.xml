CDATA The answer is there is no limit.     The transaction file limitation by default is 64Mbyte. And the file name is like: blockfile_XXXXXX (it starts 000000 and probably ends with 999999). So  it would see m that the transaction log limitation is 64Mbyte x 999999 = 61Tbyte and  we are limited to 1 million of these files, but in fact  it is not the case at all.   See: https://play.golang.org/p/3084Se2oTyf The zero padding  on the filename is simply to make the files ordered when viewing on file system, it is not a limit. There have been enough questions and incorrect assumptions in this area, that it is worth documenting in the ledger topic.     Other suggested locations would be to * create an FAQ around transactions and include this. * add a sentence in the Blockchain network key concept indicating that there is no limit to the number of transaction files. * Update ledger architecture topic * Add sentence to new transaction key concept topic.     ></description> </Issue>

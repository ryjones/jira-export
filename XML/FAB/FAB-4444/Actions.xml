CDATA From rday in hyperledger e-mail: We should prioritize Principal. | | | |*what exactly is a "principal", since docs are a bit confusing*  From:  rpjday@crashcourse.ca|mailto:rpjday@crashcourse.ca?subject=Re:%20what%20exactly%20is%20a%20%22principal%22%2C%20since%20docs%20are%20a%20bit%20confusing  Date: Wed, 09 May 2018 12:26:52 UTC   from fabric docs, "What is an Identity?":  "Hyperledger Fabric uses certain properties in an actor’s identity to determine permissions, and it gives them a special name – a principal. Principals are just like userIDs or groupIDs, but a little more flexible because they can include a wide range of an actor’s identity properties."  this is a confusing definition, since it's not clear whether "principal" refers to the *actor*, or to some collective set of the actor's *properties*, and the fact that the term "principal" is singular only adds to the potential confusion.| | |  ></body> </Action>

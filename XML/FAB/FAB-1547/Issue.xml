CDATA FAB-1022 adds support for join channel.  This task makes the support usable by installing noopssingleclient for each channel. With this support multiple peers in an org can join a chain (created before hand).   This is an intermediate step pending support for multichannel from gossip.    The task will also make  a genesis block for **TEST_CHAINID** available for users to join. When "create chain" becomes available, users will be able to join arbitrary chains.  ></description> </Issue>

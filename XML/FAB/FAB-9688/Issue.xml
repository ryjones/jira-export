CDATA There is a ChainID field attached to the CCID struct.  If set, this causes the GetName() to return a unique name per channel.  However, the rest of the codebase depends on GetName() returning the same name regardless of channel.  So, setting this field actually breaks chaincode management (it would force a container to spawn per channel, not per chaincode), however there are comments which indicate it must be set for anything but chainless syscc.  ></description> </Issue>

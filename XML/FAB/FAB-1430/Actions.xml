CDATA I actually think this is something still relevant.  Right now, any malicious user can send the same transaction over and over and over again, any transaction in the past (not just his). And since we don't have support of TLS CRLs (no one implemented it...) then there is no way to block that user, except from figuring out where he/she sends the transactions from and blocking the IP.   ></body> </Action>

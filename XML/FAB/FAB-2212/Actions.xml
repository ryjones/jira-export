CDATA I have implemented some of these already (2, 3, part of 4, part of 7) in private commits. They touch many function interfaces and there is significant code refactoring.  Current plan (as of May 2017): * finish 7 (see subtask FAB-3501) * if necessary and if possible: figure out how to break up all the changes into understandable pieces so we can submit a few smaller patch-requests. * postponeÂ 1 (but still should do this enhancement) * postpone 9 (but still must do it) * postpone 4 until needed (the code functionality is mostly done; we just need to add API for user to exercise it) * abandon 5 * abandon 8 * abandon 6 (this requires a rewrite, and is not simple to do while keeping current design and functionalities)  ></body> </Action>

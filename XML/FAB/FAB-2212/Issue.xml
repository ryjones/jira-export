CDATA Add features to the OTE, in fabric/bddtests/regression/go/ote/, for additional testing capabilities. Some ideas are: # Verify the contents of last block that is received by the consumers on each channel # Allow test code to select which orderer to spy on # Allow option to defer creating and attaching masterSpy until later in the test, and a function to trigger it # Options for changing the size of the broadcast timestamp payload, fixed or dynamic # Add function for creating multiple producers per chnl per orderer # Capability to run traffic for a duration, instead of specifying number of TXs to complete # Authentication of certs of Producer TXs and Consumers invoking deliver() # Use different chaincodes to send transactions to orderer from producer (api) - this would be a big change # change Panics to return failure values, so CI can complete all go tests  ></description> </Issue>

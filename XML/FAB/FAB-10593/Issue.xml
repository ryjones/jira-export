CDATA The function that performs a bulkupload of docs to couchdbÂ  `{color:#000000}commitUpdates{color}` ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/commit_handling.go#L92)  monolithic in the sense that it retries committing the individual doc if the bulkupload fails. This makes it hard to write a test to make sure that bulkload works in a regular scenario (see related bug - FAB-10558).  This function and the code that uses this should be refactored such that a unit-test can be written to verify this.  ></description> </Issue>

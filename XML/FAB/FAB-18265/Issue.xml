CDATA 1.4.7 Fabric introduced a breaking change in BCCSP when using persistent write protected storage on Kubernetes. Prior to 1.4.7 if the user set `core.peer.bccsp.pkcs11.filekeystore` the directory was never created. In 1.4.7, a small refactoring forced the directory to start being created, despite the fact it wasn't needed. For users who use kubernetes and init containers to create the directories, this change prevents the peer startup sequence from happening due to these volumes being write protected.  A PKCS11 BCCSP provider does not require a keystore. We should remove the path that initializes a keystore and always use a dummy keystore instead.  ></description> </Issue>

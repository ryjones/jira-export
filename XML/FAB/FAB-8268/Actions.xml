CDATA Just had a conversation with  ~mastersingh24  on this. We're trying to understand the deployment flow relative to the database creation, index creation, and chaincode deploy/launch relative to the expected behavior. At a high level it seems like an issue creating the index should behave similarly to a failure to launch the chaincode.  We think there are two cases we have to deal with: 1. The index definition is invalid; it will never work. 2. The index definition is valid but creating the index encounters a transient failure  In case 1, the index definition is bad. It will never work. A new version of the chaincode needs to be deployed. In case 2, if we were able to launch the chaincode, create the index, and then stop the chaincode if either of those failed, we would implicitly get a retry.  Before implementing this style of re-processing, we should discuss options.  ></body> </Action>

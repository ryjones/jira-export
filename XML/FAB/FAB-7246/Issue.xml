CDATA Test name: Performance test: channel events, 2 channels  Component: Performance test  Description: performance events per channel with levelDB      chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_cc, instantiated      transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 10000 invokes concurrently          thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2     Network Topology: docker containers; 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with both channels  Client Driver: PTE  Results:  The test passes if      the execution completes without error      each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself      each thread does not receive any event that not associated with the channel it registered  The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

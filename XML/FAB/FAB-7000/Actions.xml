CDATA What is the level of integration testing for the new features, especially given that the SDK work is still TBD?   Also, what about documentation and sample apps? We will need much more than a single end-to-end demo. Documentation and samples is where we are getting dinged the most.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart   ~ChristopherFerris  Although the top level epic needs voting, I do think that this issue requires it as well.  Assuming that there is support for FAB-2005, the question becomes whether we wish to enable the peer and orderer support for this crypto scheme _as a non-experimental feature_ in v1.1, rather than delaying it wholesale for another release.  To my thinking, if we have confidence that the MSP implementation is sound, this strategy makes a lot of sense.  By baking non-experimental support into v1.1, the SDKs will have a stable target to develop against during the v1.2 release cycle, and, users can begin taking advantage of the new features when v1.2 is released by upgrading their SDKs without having to upgrade the rest of the fabric network.  Essentially, there is no reason we need to tie SDK support to peer/orderer support in this case.  The feature is not complete until both are merged, but, if the peer/orderer code is good to go, I see no reason not to enable it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jyellick   ~elli-androulaki   ~dubovitskaya  I agree this one makes sense as 'review-needed' so that maintainers can vote to make it a production feature of 1.1 rather than tech preview (experimental) feature of 1.1 as originally proposed in the parent FAB-2005. As Chris mentioned, getting the system test, documentation, and samples in place would be required to make this a production feature.  The SDKs can indeed lag behind, but it would be good to get at least one SDK working for end-to-end testing.  I believe Maria mentioned java SDK support is in progress.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Status update:  Code: merged. We did the playback, showed the e2e_cli demo and implemented the feedback received at the playback.  Docs: We already provided the documentation for the Idemix principles, msp, idemixgen (docs/source/idemix.rst for ---FAB-5725---, docs/source/idemixgen.rst ---FAB-5674---). We are adding the description of the e2e demo with Idemix as well (FAB-7243).   Samples: Since we provide e2e_cli tests for the Go release, we do not have samples to add to the fabric-samples repository.   SDK: java-idk is WIP, most of the code is written, integration will be finalized in 1-2 weeks. The tests use the crypto material produced by idemixgen go tool from fabric code contribution (tests pass, so the idemix crypto libraries in java and go are compatible).  Systest: code is ready to be tested (FAB-7120). In fact it is tested with the e2e_cli and sdk integration.      ></body> </Action>

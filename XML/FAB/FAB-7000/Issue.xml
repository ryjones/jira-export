CDATA We propose to include the identity mixer MVP go code (Epic FAB-2005) in 1.1 GA instead of the planned 1.1 tech preview. We think it is ready for the following reasons: the code is merged, properly tested, we don't expect further changes, and we have a working end-to-end demo.   The SDK-related parts of Idemix will be released with the corresponding SDKs as soon as they are ready (Java is expected to be ready in 1-2 weeks, the Java crypto library is tested for compatibility with the Go crypto library). Once the SDK parts are released the Idemix privacy-preserving transaction signing feature will be publicly announced.  Please discuss this proposal.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The first Jira link in the root README.md file points to   https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=FAB&rapidView=5&view=planning    There are two issues with this link   1. It is not accessible unless you're logged in. This was brought up as a usability issue at the recent maintainers meeting.  ~rjones-lf  double checked the Jira settings to confirm that there is no option for anonymous access to all pages.   2. It points to Boards -> Fabric - Membership Services once logged in instead of a higher level Fabric page.   I suggest we point the link to the Fabric Dashboard.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104   ></description> </Issue>

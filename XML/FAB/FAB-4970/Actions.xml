CDATA When performing the following to obtain the Marble history: {code} When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "getHistoryForMarble","marble1"  And I wait "10" seconds {code} I receive the following output: {code}  {"TxId":"114f15b75eb6ead73125bbcc8a40575d68cff4fb3d3334276735b0e1dde98bde", "Value":{"docType":"marble","name":"marble1","color":"red","size":35,"owner":"tom"}, "Timestamp":"2017-06-26 21:28:33.733410705 +0000 UTC", "IsDelete":"false"}  {code}  When performing the following to obtain the marble range: {code} When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "getMarblesByRange","marble1", "marble201"  And I wait "10" seconds {code} I receive the following output: {code}  {"Key":"marble1", "Record":{"docType":"marble","name":"marble1","color":"red","size":35,"owner":"tom"}}  {code}  Since you are performing "get" calls, these should be queries and not invokes. I am also modifying the framwork to allow for verification of a subset of the output. The following scenario works with this added code change. {code} Scenario: FAB-XXXX: Test marbles chaincode Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type kafka And I wait "60" seconds When a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/marbles02" with  ""  with name "mycc" And I wait "5" seconds When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "initMarble","marble1","red","35","tom"  And I wait "10" seconds When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "readMarble","marble1"  Then a user receives successful response of {"docType":"marble","name":"marble1","color":"red","size":35,"owner":"tom"} When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "initMarble","marble201","blue","6","ram"  And I wait "10" seconds # Test getHistoryForMarble When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "getHistoryForMarble","marble1"  And I wait "10" seconds Then a user receives a response containing {"docType":"marble","name":"marble1","color":"red","size":35,"owner":"tom"}, "Timestamp" from "peer0.org1.example.com" # Test getMarblesByRange When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "getMarblesByRange","marble1", "marble201"  And I wait "10" seconds Then a user receives successful response of  {"Key":"marble1", "Record":{"docType":"marble","name":"marble1","color":"red","size":35,"owner":"tom"}}  from "peer0.org1.example.com" {code}  ></body> </Action>

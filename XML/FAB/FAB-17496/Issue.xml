CDATA After speaking with Gari, the value in migrating the remaining CTE tests is essentially non-existent. We can remove the entire directory.  LTE has been incorporated into Fabric and can be removed.  envsetup and fca-sample is completely unused.  Fabric-SDK-Node is no longer used anywhere, other than a stray reference to a chaincode that no longer exists in PTE.  Fabric-CA has a reference in Doc and nowhere else. This includes the Fabric-CA images  Fabric-Samples has chaincode referenced in PTE but that chaincode is now part of Fabric-Test, so we can change the pointers  Â   ></description> </Issue>

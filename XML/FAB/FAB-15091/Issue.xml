CDATA The *first-network* sample attempts to be everything to everybody and it is going to crater soon.  *first-network* should actually just spin up the various nodes (it's ok to generate the required crypto material). It should not:   * create channels * install chaincode * instantiate chaincode * invoke / query chaincode     We can then decide how to build tutorials for performing those actions.  Doing all of these things through various scripts really does not help demonstrate how to actually perform these actions.  There actually "tutorial-like" documentation about the samples ... this just needs to be modified to actually be a real tutorial.  ></description> </Issue>

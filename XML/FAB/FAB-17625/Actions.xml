CDATA These errors indicate that your peer credentials do not match the credentials expected in the channel configuration, and is typically seen when the channel config and peers are using a mix of older credentials and newer credentials from different trial attempts. I'd suggest start with a known working sample such as test network to understand how the credentials come together: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/test_network.html  Since there is no evidence of a bug per se, let's close the bug issue. For configuration issues such as these, Rocket.Chat, Stackoverflow, and Fabric mailing list are your best bets for finding help.  ></body> </Action>

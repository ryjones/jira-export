CDATA Using BDD process, create placeholders for all the planned system performance tests as documented in testplan -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IdXCuYMKkqXr3Za0pVnFP3sP1jBcNbYnTJGV-nSkxI/edit#gid=1813008746 . Additionally, we will request the CI team to get Jenkins to execute them in its daily test run. Of course, the "dummy" tests will fail initially. Later, in other tasks, we will add all the actual test scripts one by one as they are written, and over time we should see test report summaries with increasing number of tests being executed (and hopefully passing!) as the test scripts become merged.  This submission will need to produce output in xml, so Jenkins can display them nicely. To do that, we will establish a simple python wrapper driver which can be used to call our shell scripts tests, one at a time, and search the stdout of each testcase for a unique, specified string to determine the pass/fail result for each test.  ></description> </Issue>

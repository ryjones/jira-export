CDATA Once upon a time in a kingdom not far from here, there was a problem with the vanity import machinery for {{golang.org/x/lint}} so a temporary workaround was added to use {{github.com/golang/lint/golint}}. Over time, the temporary change became permanent as code was reworked and history forgotten.  Then, a few hours ago, a commit landed in golint that included the import directive comment making the workaround break. With new found attention to the issue, the workaround is being removed so that peace can once again reign.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Update text to something like: If you want additional peers to interact with ledger, then you will need to join them to the channel, and install the same name, version and language of the chaincode source onto the appropriate peer’s filesystem. A chaincode container will be launched for each peer as soon as they try to interact with that specific chaincode. Again, be cognizant of the fact that the Node.js images will be slower to compile.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Set the chaincode endorsement policy back to OR so the tutorial will work and then explained how you can set it to AND but you need to ensure you install the chaincode on peers in both orgs.     https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/28164     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Dave E. suggested we keep this consistent with the automated script so I abandonded the previous CR and created this new one which installs the cc on the second peer: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/28167  ></body> </Action>

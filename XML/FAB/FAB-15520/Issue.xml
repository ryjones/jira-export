CDATA TestLeaderYield() starts 2 peers: p0 and p1, and waits for p0 to be  elected as leader. The problem is that there is a 50% chance that p1 will be elected. It depends on who has the lower gossip service port. The lower is the first leader. When p1 is elected first, the test waits longer  because it needs p1 to renounce its leadership and p0 to take it.  This task is about setting p0 to be the peer with the lower port in order  to speed up the test.  ></description> </Issue>

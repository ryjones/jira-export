CDATA In para 1.3,it is mentioned  " By relying on the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols that do not require costly mining."  While ideally it should read  "By relying on the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) that does not require costly mining instead of  byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols which may suit multi-party permission-less use case"  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Do we have compatibility issues with mixed sets of peers from v1.0 and v1.1?  ~C0rWin  I am under the impression (correct me please if I'm wrong) that the side DB new messages would simply be "ignored" by peers from v1.0 when they reach the  message handling|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go#L349  logic of v1.0  and the addition of fields of the side DB would simply be "invisible" to peers from v1.0  Do we still need to add a version? Perhaps we should delay this as much as possible, until we find such a need?   1 more thing that is un-clear to me: why do all components have the same protocol version? (1.1 in v1.1) I would envision each "interaction" have its own version - for example, a Deliver API that has its own version and gossip protocol has its own version.  wdyt Artem, Binh?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This has become internal to gossip now to determine whether a version is needed at handshake and no longer a requirement from the protocol.  I don't really see the need for this as we have changed how we handle compatibility in v1.1. We may need to revisit in the next release if incompatibility in gossip communication arises.Â   ></body> </Action>

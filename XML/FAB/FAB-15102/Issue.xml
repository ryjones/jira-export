CDATA In the orderer configuration proto-buff definition, extend ConsensusType to include:  migration_state enum \{NONE, START, COMMIT}  NONE is normal state  START is entry to "maintenance mode", with current consensus type.  COMMIT is in "maintenance mode", with a new consensus type.     When this state is either START | COMMIT, the orderer goes into maintenance mode, which means: - Normal transactions are rejected - Only config changes that change the ConsesusType group are allowed (and those need to be signed by an orderer admin) - Deliver requests are rejected  (these are not implemented in this task, though).     ></description> </Issue>

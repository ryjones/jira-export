CDATA The peer codebase makes extensive use of messaging protos, particularly the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec, ChaincodeInvocationSpec, and ChaincodeSpec messages, to pass state through the peer internally.  This creates a tight coupling between the external interfaces of peer and lifecycle and the internal implementations.  In order to implement a new lifecycle these tight couplings must be eliminated.  This task is making the state dependencies of various components explicit and to pass internal messages rather than external protos.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a Raft node detects its eviction, it pulls all blocks up to the last config block and then commits it using the WriteBlock method of the chain.     The problem is that this method, signs the block as well, but it means the orderer signs blocks using an identity that might not be authorized, so peers won't be able to verify it when they will pull it.     Another problem is that it doesn't update the last config (because WriteConfigBlock isn't used), so it writes a wrong last config in the metadata.     What we need to do, is to just append the block to the ledger in its raw form since it is pulled from a remote Raft node.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The cauthdsl {{policyparser.go}} provides a human readable language for specifying policy strings.  It supports syntax like {{OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.admin')}}, but per the proto specification a perfectly legal policy string would also be {{'Org1.member'}}.  Simply doing {{OR('Org1.member')}} works around the problem, but it's a bit unintuitive.  It would be nice to enhance the code to handle this case.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Acceptance*: A fabric client can be built to submit an “issue” request to a peer. The peer validates the request and checks that the request's creator has the rights to submit that request. If this is case, a mockup RequestImport object is created which is then embedded in a TokenTransaction message. This message is returned back to the client via response.  *Remarks:* access control can be performed in multiple way. Example are: # request's creator is a writer of the channel the request targets; # request's creator is a writer of the channel the request targets AND the creator is in the contacted peer's organisation;   ></description> </Issue>

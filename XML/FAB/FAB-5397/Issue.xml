CDATA The first-network sample in fabric samples creates user User1 and Admin. I wanted to understand how to use these users from Nodejs application. It creates keystore, signercerts,admincerts and cacerts. How should we use these certs to login to the network to invoke or execute the query. In the wallet folder for fabcar, we have three files but here we have the keystore which is priv key and signercerts is the public key, how should we create the other file (like PeerAdmin in fabcar/cred) or do we need that file for the Nodejs application.  It would be helpful to have documentation on how to get the node SDK to read the cryptogen identity info from disk   https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-documentation?msg=beYSWwxB82yeJgiT6   https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/User.html#setEnrollment__anchor   https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Client.html#setUserContext__anchor   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As application developer, I want an easy way to deploy and test my app by only having a single orderer process.  This refers to the 'Solo' ordering process.  This will be a simple to deploy, minimal code ordering process.  Because there is only one process, no 'consensus' need be reached between multiple processes, so this is largely as simple as having multiple clients write into a buffered channel, with a single thread reading it, and creating batches/blocks.  The deliver side is only slightly more complicated, as to allow for disconnection and reconnection, the orderer service must allow history to be discovered.  This requires implementing a simple in RAM ledger, and allowing individual clients to seek within it.   ></description> </Issue>

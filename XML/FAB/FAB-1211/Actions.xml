<Action id="19882" issue="13545" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Ramesh, I am not sure yet because I have not spoken to Barry - but I suspect that it is the overall process for the CI. I say this because he also wants slides describing the regression testing (which do not exist yet in v1.0). The assumption is that the similar things will be used in v1.0, so it will probably be presented as &quot;this is what we are doing in hyperledger fabric&quot; development. I have asked him via our slack channel for clarification tomorrow." created="2016-11-29 00:42:52.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2016-11-29 00:42:52.0"/>

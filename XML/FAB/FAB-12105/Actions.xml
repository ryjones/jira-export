CDATA Sanitizing/Validating the policy at chaincode simulation is wrong, because it forbids clients from creating a custom validation plugin that uses custom-made policies.  The other option would be to validate/sanitize at the time when the default validation logic is executed. However # this sanitization/validation can never be complete # fabric's trust model would assure that no malicious policy can be set if a transaction is properly endorsed  As a consequence, no further work is necessary.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The "peer channel fetch" and "peer chaincode install" commands currently log their success output message at the debug level. This can make certain integration/e2e tests fail unexpectedly if the log level is set to any other level.Â   It seems natural that the logged message upon success should be at the info level.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Specifics needed: * API for requesting the subchannel * API for using the subchannel * Is this subchannel only between 2 peers or can many peers be apart of the subchannel? * Can you restrict who can be allowed in a subchannel? Is this in the genesis block?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~kim@letkeman.net , Yes, this issue was written in Oct, before the idea of channel was more "baked" than it is now. Now, we use channels and there is a slightly different process that is followed for multiple peers to join a channel. In short, we no longer have the concept of "subchannels" - only channels.   ></body> </Action>

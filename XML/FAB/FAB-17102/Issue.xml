Newer Go projects are written using Go Modules meaning it is no longer necessary for the Go to be written within a Go path to be valid. It should therefore be able to handle this new style and allow me to package my Go project outside my GOPATH." priority="3" resolution="10200" status="6" created="2019-11-18 13:49:28.0" updated="2019-11-18 16:42:42.0" resolutiondate="2019-11-18 16:42:42.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="56474"/>

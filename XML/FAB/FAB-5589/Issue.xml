CDATA The policy framework currently supports the notion of an implicit meta policy.  IE, a policy which evaluates sub-policies and based on some rule, returns a policy result of its own.  These are extremely useful for default policies, as it can express things like "Any user who's cert satisfies their own org's Reader's policy may read".  The 'impliict' part of the implicit meta policy has one notable limitation.  It is only possible to make a rule based on the sub-policies of all sub-groups, not of some subset.  To address this deficiency, and make the policy framework more powerful, an explicit meta policy type should be introduced.  It should act like the implicit meta policy, referencing sub-policies, but it should be able to restrict the subset of groups to an explicit set.  Ideally, it should re-use the cauthdsl framework so that the explicit policy rules may be arbitrarily powerful.  ></description> </Issue>

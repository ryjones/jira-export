CDATA For any internal usage, it is good to have map so that lookup and comparison code can be written with lesser lines of codes. If the order of the stored entries do not matter, then slice is not needed and adds a lot of complexity during lookups.  Given above, we need to change the slice used for missingData to a map.  In the BlockAndPvtData, we have Block, BlockPvtData, and Missing. These names are not very informative and get confused with another struct named BlockPvtData. Hence, we need to use proper names for readability and avoid confusion.Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The fabric/examples/cluster organization structure (found in config/configtx.yaml) demonstrates example working organization definitions for fabric certificate generation.  This example is no longer a full example of a production-like deployment, as it does not include similar definitions for tls issucing cert organizations.  In lieu of a working example config that then generates via cryptogen or openssl the appropriate tls certs, the example should include, as part of the 'make compose-up' step, a full specification, with examples, of the required tls certificates.  Note: support for FQDN vs comman name in name field is an example of the type of question that does not appear to be addressed in any doc or code specification of tls certs  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Known work-around:  Kill/restart the chaincode after the deploy but before the invoke.  The root cause is related to chaincode FSM: Non-devmode deployment naturally disconnects the chaincode container after the deployment.  Devmode FSM is still expecting disconnect.  However, since the code is manually driven, this will not happen unless the user takes action.  Actual fix will involve updating the FSM to understand devmode realities.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We have not got the latest fabric with your changes yet.Â  However, with RC1, we are able to reproduce the defect when adding an org (org5) to an existing collection  The existing collection   ^collection-FAB-12743.json   The new collection   ^collection-FAB-12773.json   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes  ~dongming  - without the fix, this should be reproducible if you perform the following. - Submit private data transactions with original collection config (i.e., without org5 as a member in it) -  Commit at least 256 blocks and the last block (i.e., block 255) happens to contain private data - I believe that in this test anyways, all the blocks would be  containing the private data. The significance of block no. 255 is that, this is the first number whose encoding would lead to surface the bug - Upgrade to new collection config (for including org5).  ></body> </Action>

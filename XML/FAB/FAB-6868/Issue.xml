CDATA The peer resource config service needs to leverage mutual TLS in order for the query not be relayable.   For that, we need to: * Add the TLS cert hash to the channel header * Write a filter function that accepts an envelope and a gRPC context, and points out whether the TLS cert hash in the channel header matches the one computed from the gRPC context.   * This can be re-used for the channel event service   ~jyellick   ~wlahti     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA with  ~jiangyaoguo  change to FAB-1237 and FAB-1238, upgrade is hooked into the fabric and is executed by the LCCC and deployed by the endorser.  However, to complete the flow, we need to use the version to run the upgraded chaincode in a different container. This is done by using the version in the registering name of the chaincode. This is a transient name that is not saved or remembered beyond the life of the running container and is used only as a unique registration ID.  ></description> </Issue>

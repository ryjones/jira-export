CDATA The EventHub functionality was replaced by the much improved Channel Event Service in v1.1.0.Â  We've always known that the EventHub was a stop gap on the way to a channel-scoped event service.  Given this and given the number of issue that exist with the EventHub (many of which cannot really be fixed without major surgery if at all), we should remove the EventHub from the peer as well as all of the SDKs.  ></description> </Issue>

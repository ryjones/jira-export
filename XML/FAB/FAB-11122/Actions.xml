CDATA From the SDK perspective :  It seems to me we would really need to move the SDK version 2.0 to do this. This change would necessitate client to change their application code. I think there would be a lot of confusion for the SDKs to be at 2.0 and Fabric at 1.3 level.  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Let's collect the facts before we make a decision about which release event hub is removed in.  For each of the SDKs, what is the last release that used the peer's event hub?Â   ~rickr   ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   ~troyronda   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Looks like java sdk makes both the old event hub and the new event deliver service available in v1.1 and v1.2.  Java sdk release notes gave warning not to use the old event hub as of 1.1.  Looks like node sdk made both the old event hub and the new event deliver service available in v1.1 and v1.2, and used old event hub in samples until FAB-11220.   Go SDK already automatically uses delivery service based on channel capabilities.  ></body> </Action>

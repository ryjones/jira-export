CDATA As of the time of this writing (HEAD at {{acf93e75d}}), we do not have the most recent versions for the following dependencies:  https://github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient/releases (1.2.0 vs 1.1.0) https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases (0.0.2 vs 0.0.1) https://github.com/spf13/pflag/releases (1.0.1 vs 1.0.0) https://github.com/uber-go/tally/releases (3.3.3 vs 3.3.2) https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases (1.12.0 vs 1.11.3) https://github.com/cheggaaa/pb/releases (1.0.24 vs 1.0.22)  In our {{constraint}} stanzas we define versions without an operator. According to the documentation, this means that we're actually pinning the left-most non-zero digit in the version. However {{dep ensure}} on the latest master ({{acf93e75d}} does not result in any changes. Interesting.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Submitted a bunch of CRs to update dependencies. I did separate CRs for dependencies that may be problematic ({{dep ensure -update  package name }} and then one large one for everything else {{dep ensure -update}}.  As part of this exercise, I updated version specs for a couple of dependencies and pinned some transient dependencies for docker and sarama with overrides. I also had to address some fallout related to testify and protobuf changes.  ></body> </Action>

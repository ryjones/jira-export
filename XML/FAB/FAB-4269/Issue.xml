CDATA Need to restructure some of the e2e_cli content, e.g. remove end-to-end.rst in favor of Getting Started instructions, review all files, etc.  Review/Finalize automation that builds out the release e2e content.     Questions:  Should there be a step-by-step path as well as an all-in-one path?  Pre-build the relevant artifacts rather than requiring all the scripts to be run to generate the crypto and channel material?  Provide SDK client in addition to cli client going forward?     ></description> </Issue>

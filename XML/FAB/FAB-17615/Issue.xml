CDATA To support the stand up of detachable network in Kubernetes we need a pipeline that can stand up networks and cache their artifacts for consumption by other jobs.  Originally we intended to be able to reference the artifacts of this pipeline in our future pipelines but they are no longer retained indefinitely. So maybe we can store them as config maps or secrets in the clusters, or we can use IBM Object Store to store them as a tarball (this may make more sense as we can just curl the URL and get the tarball later).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA yes. folks will run the behave and unit tests themselves, and the "smoke tests" that would be run automatically as part of the merge process are simply a subset of those which are run first.   ></body> </Action>

There are a handful of tests that make sense for testing the very basic functionality before going into more extensive tests and would be great for a smoke test. Since the behave tests will be executed with every merge, there's no need to run them in a daily or 72 hour run.  At this point, the behave tests take about an hour to run through all of the feature files.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I propose to rename "local-MSP" as "org-MSP".  While channel MSP clearly signifies what it does, local-MSP provides an impression that the MSP on the peer, orderer and client/user of the same org can differ.  I found it difficult to grasp as a new user, and hence I propose to change name of "local-MSP" to "org-MSP" or something representing that local MSPs are org specific and same on the local nodes for the org.  ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="37742" key="FAB-14221" number="14221" project="10002" reporter="scottz" creator="scottz" type="10101" summary="5. Raft Quorum Tests: stop multiple orderers (some or all) to prevent consensus quorum, and then recover them, in different sequences, with traffic" description="We have covered this at some level with FAB-14220, which became a better test than originally designed, where we stopped/restarted different number of and combinations of orderers. What that test does NOT do is, after some orderers are stopped, to start (only) different subsets orderers (rather than starting all of them at once) to bring up the total number to be just enough to reestablish quorum (with different set of orderers that had been part of the most recent quorum). This is targeting functionality that is part of the raft logic, not so much our orderer code, so it does not have to be in the critical list for this fabric release but still is something we could execute to be thorough. We might also consider doing this along with FAB-14293, when we set up orderers in different clusters in distant locations." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2019-02-18 02:17:42.0" updated="2019-08-08 15:36:35.0" resolutiondate="2019-07-30 20:29:11.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="49358"/>

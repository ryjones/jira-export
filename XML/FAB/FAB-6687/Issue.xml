CDATA In the loop of sending invoke transactions, for each transaction PTE * prepares the invoke transaction proposal * sends the proposal to peer * waits for the proposal response to form a transaction * sends the transaction to orderer  The preparation and waiting proposal response consumes about 10-15 ms which prevents PTE to send transactions at a very low frequency.  Users have to use multiple processes to achieve higher sending rate. Few things to consider to optimize the process: * move the preparation out of the loop, such as prepare the transaction by another process or before the sending loop * re-construct the loop, such as process the transaction in parallel  ></description> </Issue>

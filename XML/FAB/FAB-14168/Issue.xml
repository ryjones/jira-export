CDATA Related to  FAB-14145|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14145   Given an endorsing policy with multiple signatures, e.g. 3-of, with different write sets, the debug logs of the peer shows the following line upon error:  ```  36m2019-02-12 10:32:12.474 UTC  cauthdsl  func2 -> DEBU 7aa49  0m 0xc0031a0a40 signature for identity 1 is invalid: The signature is invalid ```  My petition is to change the debug messages to something more descriptive of the reason of the invalid signature, as it now seems it is a failure in the signature itself, not the difference between the write sets of the first endorsement checked and the current one being validated.  Also, it might be a bug if indeed the peer checks all write sets against the first endorsement, instead of trying to construct a valid endorsement with the rest of endorsements that might have the same write set.   ></description> </Issue>

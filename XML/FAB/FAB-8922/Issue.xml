CDATA The current build process places a number of golang files into the build directory. These files prevent successful execution of tests directly from the fabric source tree via `go test ./...`.  By naming the directory with a period prefix, the directory is ignored by the build tooling. (A hidden _build directory would also work.)  ></description> </Issue>

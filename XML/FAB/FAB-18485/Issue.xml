CDATA Fabric orderer hardcodes client keepalives at 60s.  The leader to follower communications do not need keepalives since there is a constant Raft heartbeat.  The follower to leader communications would benefit from a configurable client keepalive however, in case there is idle time between sending transactions between follower and leader.  A good default is probably 30s (make sure the ServerMinInternal on the orderers become 25s by default too, otherwise its going to tell any keepalives to go away).  ></description> </Issue>

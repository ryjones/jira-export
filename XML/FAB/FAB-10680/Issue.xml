CDATA GetTransactionById returns the transaction including validation status.  In the rare case that the same transaction id gets submitted a second time, that submission will automatically get invalidated.  GetTransactionById will continue to return the initial valid transaction.  This can be confusing to the client that (accidentally) submitted the duplicate.  To make this more clear, it would be better to utilize a new API like GetTransactionsById which could return all the transactions and their statuses matching the transaction id.  See FAB-8557 for more context.  ></description> </Issue>

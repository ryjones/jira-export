CDATA A client sends one request to deliver blocks from a channel indefinitely.  This request is authorized before any blocks are delivered.  However, it is possible that that client's access will be revoked, in which case, the Deliver service should re-evaluate that client's ability to receive blocks, and return a 'FORBIDDEN' error, breaking the stream.  To test: # Connect a client to the peer's Deliver service, requesting blocks Newest->Max_Uint64 # Send a transaction, verify that the client gets a new block. # Send a config update which removes that client's org, or adds that client's certificate to the CRL. # Send a transaction, verify that the client does not get a new block containing this transaction, and instead gets a FORBIDDEN result.  ></description> </Issue>

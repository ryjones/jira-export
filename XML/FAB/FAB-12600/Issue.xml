CDATA This is an adjustment of TokenTxProcessor to adhere to the freshly decided interface for transaction processors in FAB-12221 accommodating at least two functions * Preprocess() (bool, error) => performs any check that can be done safely assuming read access to the ledger till the previous block, and parallel transaction processing for transactions in the same block * Process(state ledger.PublicState) (bool, error) => perform checks that are required to be done in a sequential manner for transactions in the block currently processed, assuming writes of previous transactions are visible; perform also writes  Notice that this interface may change as FAB-12221 evolves. So this item is partially blocked by FAB-12221.  This adjustment should take place for token transactions associated to transfer, issue, redeem (FAB-11144), approve, transferFrom(FAB-12267), and indirect invocations of transfer, issue, redeem (FAB-11965)) and transferFrom (FAB-12267).  ></description> </Issue>

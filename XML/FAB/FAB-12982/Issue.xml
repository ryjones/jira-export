CDATA Currently private data is disseminated randomly to collection member peers. It would be better to make a best effort attempt to distribute the private data to as many orgs as possible, before sending to same org's 2nd, 3rd, etc peers.  This would provide a higher degree of data availability, for example in case a subset of orgs went offline.  On the commit pull side, peers would consequently want to prefer peers from their same org, as these peers are more likely to be co-located. For example for pull we may want to prioritize peers as follows: 1) endorsers from same org 2) endorsers from other orgs 3) non-endorsers from same org 4) non-endorsers from other orgs  ></description> </Issue>

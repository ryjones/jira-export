CDATA I would say "No", the new node should not be considered as a part of the active quorum.  I say this for a few different reasons:  1) Assuming this is a normal case operation where the node is already online and a member of the system channel, then it could take that node up to 10 minutes to discover he's been added to a channel, meaning adding the node could result in 10 minutes of downtime, in a normal operational case. 2) Assuming this is an addition to the orderer system channel, it is in general not possible to have the node already available, so there would almost definitely be a loss of quorum. 3) If adding a node would result in loss of quorum (if the node were inactive), then cluster can/should repair or eject any faulty nodes beforehand. (ie, by adding this check, we are not preventing any recovery scenarios I can think of).  Of course, there is one special case we will have to handle, and that's the transition from a 1 node to a 2 node cluster, in this case, we'll have to accept the loss of quorum.  ></body> </Action>

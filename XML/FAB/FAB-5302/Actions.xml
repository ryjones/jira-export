CDATA FYI -  ~seanbarclay   ~lucie   ~joe-alewine   ~dlesaca  We took the advice from  ~odowdaibm  : visualizing the first app UI for users. As it's point to visually show the ledger and have simple controls to do the four different main features/functions: query all, query a car, create car and change owner. This is still an early stage of the UI/wires, we are seeking comments/feedback/questions before going any further. Thanks in advance.  Here's the rough UI/wires for the fabcar app on mural board:  https://app.mural.ly/t/ibmblockchain6461/m/ibmblockchain6461/1499806474825   And a prototype on Invision:  https://ibm.invisionapp.com/share/CMCJJ7HZP   first app_UI pdf has been attached to this ticket for a quick review.  ^first app_UI.pdf   ></body> </Action>

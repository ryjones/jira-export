CDATA With the removal of the fabric/chaincode/shim and dependencies from the v2 ccenv, chaincode packaged for previous releases can't be built with by a 2.0 peer.  It's inevitable that previously built chaincode docker images will be removed and, when that happens, the previously installed 1.x chaincode will need to be built by a 2.x peer. This will fail for go chaincode when using the 2.x version of ccenv.  To help get out of this mess, we need to verify that the peer can be successfully configured to use the hyperledger/fabric-ccenv-1.4 as the builder image.  /cc  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~jyellick   ></description> </Issue>

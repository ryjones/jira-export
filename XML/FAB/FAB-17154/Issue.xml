CDATA Steps:  Create 2 Org network. Org1 with org1peer1 and org1peer2 Org2 with org2peer1  Install marbles_private_go chaincode  Create channel and instantiate marbles_private_go chaincode and collections with both org1 and org2 msps getting marbles and marbles private collection on the channel  Set org1peer1 and org2peer1 as anchor peers  Send invokes (initMarble) only to org1peer1  Confirm that Marble and Marble private details are on org1peer1, org1peer2, org2peer1 org2peer1 gets data over gossip using anchor peers and external endpoints, as expected.  Delete Anchor peers to delete anchor peers.  Repeat step 5.  Observed that private data is still seen in org2peer1, possibly due to it fetching it via gossip.  Â org2peer1 should have failed to fetch this with no anchor peers on the channel, yet it got the private data as seen in marble and marble private details table in couchdb.  ></description> </Issue>

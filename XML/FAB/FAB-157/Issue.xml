CDATA publish ccenv and src docker images along with peer and membersrvc images after merge in gerrit.   In the current approach, we are publishing peer and membersrvc images from Jenkins after every successful merge.  ~ghaskins  suggested, we have to publish other images (ccenv and src) images to docker hub along with peer and membersrvc so that we no need to depend on baseimage.  ex: hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:v1.0.0 hyperledger/fabric-src:v1.0.0 hyperledger/fabric-peer:v1.0.0 hyperledger/fabric-membersrvc:v1.0.0   ></description> </Issue>

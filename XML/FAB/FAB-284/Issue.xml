CDATA @ghaskins and I were just discussing (lamenting) the state of the build and some of the patches that are looking to simplify and shorten the build. We started talking about https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/721/ which was attempting to eliminate unnecessary builds of the base image every time we build. We had previously discussed pulling out the build for the various base images into a separate repository and then controlling the specific version by referencing a specific tag in the fabric (and other) builds where we are explicitly calling out a bump of a version tag to push, and we are pulling a previously explicitly tagged version from atlas or dockerhub.  I like this approach as it is cleaner, and we can simplify and reduce the time to build. I would propose we pull out images/base into its own repository with the same set of maintainers and we adapt its build pipeline to include an explicit change required to push a version that is governed under 2+2 merge policy,  ></description> </Issue>

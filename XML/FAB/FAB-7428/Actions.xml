CDATA After looking at the CR for a few minutes, I'm confused. The original issue implies that secrets management did not work because of symlinks.  Prior to any changes, the code would issue a warning when readPemFIle failed but it would carry on enumerating over the rest of the directory entries. That means if we try to read from a symlink to a dir, the operation will fail but it's non-fatal.  Since ioutil.ReadDir is using os.Lstat under the covers 1 , the IsDir check done at the top of the loop will return false for links to directories. Given how the loop is coded, this means we'll attempt to read the link as a cert, fail, and create some noise, but it should still read and resolve the file.  At the end of the day, I think we're just trying to avoid the warning message.   1 : https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.9/src/os/dir_unix.go#L27  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This would also help in scenarios where you don't want to trust state database, and prefer to get the data directly from the block storage (could do it for all reads/writes and not just for large data).  If we were to do this, state reads would be less efficient, and rich query would not be possible (on couchdb). These may or may not be import considerations, depending on the specific use case.  ></description> </Issue>

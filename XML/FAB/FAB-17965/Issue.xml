CDATA Allow a network running with a system channel to migrate and start operate with out it. The flow for doing so is: * Enable the channel participation API on all OSNs (a staggered restart of all OSNs is required). * Put the system channel into maintenance mode in order to prevent channel creation when it is removed, resulting in inconsistencies across orderers. * Remove the system channel with the channel participation API. * Prevent config transactions that change orderer channel membership on app channels, to avoid triggering a transition from Inactive <-> RaftÂ  ** A simple option is to Halt all the channels, and ** Halt the InactiveChainRegistry * Removal should remove also all the channels the orderer is not a member of * Restart every chain (or restart the server), in order to recreat the chains and convert every chain and its haltCalback pointers from Raft+Inactive to Raft+Follower * Normal activity may resume  ></description> </Issue>

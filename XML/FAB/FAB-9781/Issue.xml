CDATA Currently is Org1 creates a channel, it generates a .block file like mychannel.block. If it wants Org2 to join the channel, the file has to be sent offline to Org2. Org2 then uses the block file to join its peer to the channel.  The offline mode of transporting the file can be eliminated if the Org2 peer connects to the orderer using an environment variable and fetches the genesis block of the channel.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This is a regression introduced by the changes in FAB-18208 - with a 1 org 1 peer network, service discovery no longer returns information on any chaincodes that are installed on that peer. This means that the SDKs cannot submit transactions with discovery enabled (the default) as the following error message is returned: {noformat} server returned: failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:"fabcar" >{noformat}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA SDKs: queries for who has agreed to a definition (will this be available for CLI as well?)  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I use the <NodeJS SDK/Java SDK> interface And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package on all peers  And an admin queries for who has approved to the chaincode definition  And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 When a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "invoke","a","b","10"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 990 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There as a user request on rocket-chat that the fault tolerance and failure modes of Fabric be more clearly documented.  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-orderer?msg=mhD9XJpcHaXXB2FEy  This seems like it would be a good idea. The user's suggestion was as a new section under https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/architecture.html  Some possible topics for discussion could be: # Replacing a failed peer # Replacing a failed OSN # Fault tolerance limitation of Kafka based ordering # Strategies for disaster preparedness (ie, spreading deployments over multiple datacenters)  The above is not meant to be exhaustive, but simply as a starting point.  ></description> </Issue>

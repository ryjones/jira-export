CDATA The current behavior of shim.MockStub is that it will set transaction time to be current time when shim.MockTransactionStart is called. But in some use case such as document's expiry date, it is necessary to be able to take control of transaction time to test this features.Â   My proposal is to add a new function shim.SetTxTimestamp which receive time.Time and set that time as a timestamp for transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

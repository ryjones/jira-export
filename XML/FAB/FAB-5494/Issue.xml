CDATA While using benchmark test, minor improvements could be made for better UX. This JIRA is used to keep track of them.  - On some systems, `file ledger` is the major bottleneck due to extensive disk IO. consequently, ordering performance improvement may not be observable. We should document this in the code and suggest to use `ram ledger` when interested in ordering service only.  ></description> </Issue>

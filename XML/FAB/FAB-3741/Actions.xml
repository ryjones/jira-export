I&apos;ve seen this happen when a new core.yaml parameter is introduced and the peer/testenv docker images haven&apos;t been rebuilt. I suggest running &quot;make clean&quot; followed by &quot;make docker&quot; each time you are running your tests with newly pulled code to be sure everything has been updated/rebuilt.Â " created="2017-05-09 12:09:32.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2017-05-09 12:09:32.0"/>

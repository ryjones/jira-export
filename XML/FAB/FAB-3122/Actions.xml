CDATA We have published tar balls per platform including chaincodes and e2e_cli scripts to releases url in nexus using maven. We have alpha2 tar balls are available here  https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-binary/   We are working on creating CI job to push these artifacts from production CI. Will improve renaming URL/optimizing build scripts based on the feed back. We will make sure fabric-binary release jobs are ready to publish tar balls based on the requirements.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA myself and  ~lehors  tested latest tar balls posted here for testing  https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-binary/  on latest fabric commit (including fix given by  ~lehors  today morning). Below are the test results:  tested on 4 different windows 7 64/32 bit machines with docker client version 1.12.0.. Worked on 3 and failed on my machine. Docker volumes are not working properly hence orderer and other containers are exiting.  tested this patch on darwin-amd64, linux-amd64, linux-s390x platform and observed it's working as expected.  tested this patch on old tar balls on darwin-amd64, linux-amd64 and linux-s390x and it worked as expected.  Though the fix is worked as expected,  ~lehors  concerned about using GO ARCH in bootstrap script.. Discussion in place in #fabric-releases channel.   We had discussion in #fabric-release channel to publish new set of tar balls and submit patch set to update bootstrap.sh script with new release URL. Waiting for approval..

CDATA To clarify: to work on the second Windows machine I have an additional patch to bootstrap.sh was necessary.  I've submitted a second CR for that:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9601/      ></body> </Action>

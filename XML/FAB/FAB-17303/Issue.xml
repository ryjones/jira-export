CDATA Org-specific implicit collections are used by v2.0 lifecycle, and can also be used by user chaincodes. Traditional collections allow for configuration properties such as *requiredPeerCount* and *maxPeerCount* to specify private data dissemination behavior, for example to require that private data has been disseminated for redundancy as a condition for successful endorsement.   Without an ability to configure properties on implicit private data collections in v2.0, we'll have to live with reasonable defaults. This story will update the defaults for explicitly defined collections and implicit collections to be: requiredPeerCount = 0 maxPeerCount = 1  ></description> </Issue>

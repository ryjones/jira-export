CDATA Hi.  A comment about the configuration:  - &Org0 # DefaultOrg defines the organization which is used in the sampleconfig # of the fabric.git development environment Name: Org0MSP  # ID to load the MSP definition as ID: Org0MSP    The org Name and ID need to be the same because the org names that are returned from the Organizations() method, which gossip uses is actually the Org Name above (in bold), and the MSP-IDs of the peers are the IDs of the org above.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/configvalues/api.go#L45-L48 // Application stores the common shared application config type Application interface { 	// Organizations returns a map of org ID to ApplicationOrg 	Organizations() map string ApplicationOrg }  If they are not the same, it causes problems for gossip and make the gossip layer think the peers of its own org are not in its channel, and since this configuration is probably done in the same way by all org operators - most likely the gossip layer would consider all peers not in the channel.  I suggest that we either: Delete the Name and leave the ID  Delete the ID and leave the Name Change the implementation of Application so that the keys of the map are the IDs and not the Names.   This wasn't known until yesterday, and I have made a change set in gossip that ignores such a bad join channel config and logs an error ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6513/ ) but I think it's better not to let the users/operators shoot themselves in the foot.    ~jyellick   ~binhn    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA From an operator's perspective, there are two possible solutions. # Eliminate one of the configuration environment variables (either Name or ID) in the Organization section for the PeerOrgs in conffigtx.yaml. It is silly and confusing to define two things that must be equivalent based on internal reasons. Of course, this requires cleaning up the code - and impacts test scripts and tools in and out of fabric, so doing this soon is VERY desirable before even more dependencies and scripts are written. # Leave both items in the config file. This makes sense only if they serve different purposes for the customer, in how they think and manage their network. Choosing this option means the customer can set them to different strings - which means we need to enhance the code to work when they are set to different values (which implies changing the title of this jira issue).   ></body> </Action>

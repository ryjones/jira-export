CDATA It looks like some effort has been made to this effect in that the log output format is controllable to an extent in  core.yaml|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/peer/core.yaml#L41 .  But this format isn't adhered to by all components.  As an example, I've noticed that cop doesn't follow this format and appears to be using the  cfssl|https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/fabric-cop/blob/72a87e3f385094471b4e3744c67df78be0fb701e/cli/server/auth.go#L27  logger?  Regardless of what package we use (I agree logrus is a good idea), can we make sure that logs from all components adhere to the standard in core.yaml or at least that there is a default standard across all components that is the same?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Have heard of some bugs in this area on what is actually being output, wrong log level, ie. warning is putting out debug.   ~bmos299  have you seen the errors in the logs?  ~benjsmi  and  ~mrshah  have come across some issues and opening bugs.  ></body> </Action>

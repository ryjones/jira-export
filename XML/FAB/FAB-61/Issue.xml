CDATA Story: Developers need the ability to understand what is being returned from the code and what is happening when something goes wrong, in a standardized fashion; so that they can go to consolidated location(s) to find messages and error logs. This information needs to be uniform in nature based on industry standards and best practices.  Description: * Standardized when to use certain errors such as a PANIC.  * Centralize where these errors and messages will be logged and output.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I have analyzed this issue further and it appears that the umask set by the creators of the z Systems Linux instances used for CI was set to 077.  This would prevent any access for user group users or other users.  Seeing as the Kafka and Zookeeper containers (created from the Kafka and Zookeeper images) start a script with a user other than root, the script would fail resulting in containers that will not start.  I have changed the umask to 022 (the default) for all of the z Systems Linux instances that take part in the CI process.  Now when I checkout the v1.0.0-alpha2 tag the docker-entrypoint.sh scripts have the following permissions: -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  873 Jun  1 18:14 docker-entrypoint.sh  I will also work with  ~rameshthoomu  to add an extra step in the release jobs that will ensure that containers created from the docker images work without error before being pushed up to the Docker Hub.  ></body> </Action>

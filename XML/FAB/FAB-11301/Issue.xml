CDATA reconcile missing private data on peers that are authorized to have it - gossip side: gossip should get from ledger the list of missing private data blocks, and the option to retrieve collection config history.   for each missing private data block, the peer should be able to filter out from the alive peers the list of peers which possibly have the missing block. the peer will select randomly a peer from the above list and will try to fetch the missing block.  in a successful scenario the peer will commit private data to the ledger, on failure it will retry to fetch it from a different peer, up to a configurable max amount of retries.  ></description> </Issue>

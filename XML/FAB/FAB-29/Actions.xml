CDATA Hi  ~sanchezl ,   how do you want to combine ( or not ) what's to be done for this story with what's being done for FAB-423 , FAB-430 ?  Are these duplicates or sub-tasks ?    I though that FAB-29 is for setting up how orderers can talk to each other and FAB-423 is for the additional task of determining which orderers are authorized to talk to each others ?  But does  ~corecode 's code already handle both tasks ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It looks like this issue is duplication of work done in  fab-473 ,  fab-359 ,  fab-426  and others.  Unless there are objections, I'll close this by Oct 6 midday.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I often see chaincode for transfer of ownership like hereÂ  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/b99e1b8da2bc4d17f689c152078d96e8f6428a27/chaincode/fabcar/fabcar.go#L178-L194  However, those samples do not indicate, how to control on-chain, that only the current owner can call this.  As a chaincode developer I want to see an example, how to do on chain access-control, possibly depending on the current world state or history.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Copied from the rocket chat, #fabric channel: {quote}Todd Little: I think it would be quite reasonable to create ACLs in chaincode using a library and storing the access information in the world state. Using the client identity chaincode library (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/chaincode/lib/cid) it would seem to be pretty straightforward to create a library using that library that accepts and manages an access control list maintained in the world state. {quote} This might be helpful for this kind of example  ></body> </Action>

CDATA related to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9081  seems like we should await v1.3 at least to see, how chaincode is supposed to access identity information. It will be really challenging to integrate identity mixer into it.  ></body> </Action>

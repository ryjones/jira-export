CDATA There is no reason to believe that a chaincode image built with mutual TLS auth, and injected peer certificate should fail to connect and operate with a v1.0.x peer.  However, this needs to be tested.  -----  Test case:  Procedure:  # Start a v1.1.0 peer # Deploy a chaincode (which either vendors the v1.1.0 chaincode shim, or does not vendor the shim) # Query the chaincode # Shutdown the peer # Downgrade the peer to v1.0.x (do not delete the chaincode image) # Start the peer # Query the chaincode  Expected Results:  The query should execute correctly.  ></description> </Issue>

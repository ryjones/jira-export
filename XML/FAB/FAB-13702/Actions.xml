CDATA Thanks for capturing this.  I've edited the Description a bit, please feel free to go over and re-edit anything you think might have been taken out incorrectly.  As for the variations for consideration, 1 and 3 sound good. I would only do 3 as an extension of this test for now. I would leave 1 for the week after, after we've ensured that the onboarding path sans crashes/restarts work well. Also, when you say "other orderer node(s)" you mean any of O1-O3, correct?  ></body> </Action>

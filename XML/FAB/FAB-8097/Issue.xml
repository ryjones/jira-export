CDATA In the current approach, CI jobs trigger unit & e2e jobs for a documentation patch set with .rst or .md changes. This approach is unnecessary and not required at all..  This should be restricted from CI configuration. The proposed approach is  When a patch set has .rst or .md changes, trigger fabric-rtd-verify-master CI job and don't trigger any other jobs. After the recent patches, now the fabric-rtd-verify-master triggers after .rst or .md changes in patch set but restriction is not happening. In result it's triggering all the jobs instead of only fabric-rtd-verify-master job.  ></description> </Issue>

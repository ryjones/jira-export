CDATA Dear Ramesh,   I think this change needs to be done in the fabric-verify-end-2-end-<arch> and fabric-verify-<arch> right? Not in the docs job.   These two jobs (unit and e2e) need to have a "Forbidden File: **/*.md, **/*.rst, **/*.txt and **/conf.py" path right?     Thanks!  Jess  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="41560" issue="27488" author="rameshthoomu" type="comment" body="yes... We can use forbidden file path to restrict builds on doc changes. But what happens if I have a patch set with both *.md* and *code* change (like .go file).. Will this stop triggering the above two jobs?" created="2018-03-13 22:05:23.0" updateauthor="rameshthoomu" updated="2018-03-13 22:05:23.0"/>

CDATA It should still trigger the fabric-verify ones since at least one of the paths is getting activated.   I can make to test this scenario     Thanks!  Jess  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Done with my testing after discovering that Jenkins's forbidden path feature has a small bug.      So normally the way to go was to add a forbidden file path for the triggers and select the "Disable Strict Forbidden File Verification" feature which should allow the verification getting tirggered for a change that combines code and documentation. But this was not working as stated, and then I came across this:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29028195/exact-use-of-forbidden-file-path-of-the-jenkins-gerrit-trigger-plugin      So in this case, it seems that we need to go another route described in that article which is what i have implemented in my tests.   Currently, my test works as expected.  The fabric-verify-end-2-end-<arch> and fabric-verify-<arch> gets triggered if: * the change contains any code changes * the change contains any code + documentation changes  It wont trigger if: * the change contains any doc changes in the *.*md, .rst, .txt and **/conf.py files     Working on translating this into JJB   ></body> </Action>

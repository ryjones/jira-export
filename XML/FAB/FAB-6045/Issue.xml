CDATA We are using Hyperledger Fabric to do commercial customer project in China. And we found a very severe problem that Fabric cannot run in the largest IaaS cloud platform Aliyun with CouchDB configured as statedb. We tried different OS (from centos to ubuntu) and OS version and different docker-compose version (even the one ship with composer). The crash log is attached. We can provide VM environment for testing & debugging if needed. It blocks part of our work.     Peer log is too long to place here. I uploaded it to a Box folder which can be access from  https://ibm.box.com/s/7nwrncxjztktslf9s3yx7jtffrhonv1s      ></description> </Issue>

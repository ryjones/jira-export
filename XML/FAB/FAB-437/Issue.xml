CDATA There are stories and tasks for Endorsers, Orderers etc. This story attempts to provide minimal scaffolding so we can incrementally build and test V1 flows. The "solo" orderer (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-31) will be used for this.  A beginning towards this was made with  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1057 (LCCC - lifecycle system chaincode),  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1177 (CLI driver for LCCC and Endorser)  With the above, we can send "deploy" and "invoke" proposals to an Endorser and receive a ProposalResponse back. Tasks will be attached to this story for reminder of flows * integrating with new ledger * sending transaction to orderer from CLI and behave tests * committing transaction from the solo orderer to the ledger     ></description> </Issue>

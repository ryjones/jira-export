CDATA  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html   page needs an overivew introduction. I suggest categories for readers to identifyÂ themselves in their own use-case, including users (testers, who may only want a working network to test) and users (chaincode developers who do not need to know all the details about creating a fabric network): * Are you looking to become a Fabric Developer? * Are you looking to use Fabric, to develop and test your own chaincode? * Are you looking to test Fabric?  Provide links to other appropriate readme files, or to sections further below in this page.  ></description> </Issue>

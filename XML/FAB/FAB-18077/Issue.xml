CDATA There are 3 code paths that may generate a snapshot. # after a block is committed # when a snapshot request is submitted # at peer startup to recover a missed snapshot generation (e.g., due to peer crash)  Currently, a go-routine is created to generate snapshot in each of the above cases. Any error from snapshot generation is simply logged as an error message. Need to revisit and decide what is the best way to handle this kind of error and how to let the administrator know a peer fails to generate a snapshot.     ></description> </Issue>

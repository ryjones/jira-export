CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API I would like to call a function to add a new consortium to the consortiums group. Consider any implications that may arise should the user not add any orgs to the new consortium (if that even matters) as well as for any examples (we should add orgs to the consortium after adding a new consortium in any examples).  Â   *Acceptance*  I can call a function to add a new consortium group. Examples are also updated demonstrating addition of a new consortium + orgs for that consortium.  ></description> </Issue>

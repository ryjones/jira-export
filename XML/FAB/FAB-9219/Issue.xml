In addition, even the hyphenÂ is unnecessary for most of those rules since they are all &quot;rm -rf&quot; commands which, by definition, cannot fail even if the arguments don&apos;t exist (although they can fail if permission is denied)." priority="4" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-03-29 10:20:14.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:49:55.0" resolutiondate="2018-05-18 15:54:41.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="41687"/>

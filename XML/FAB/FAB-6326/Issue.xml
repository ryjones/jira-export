<Issue id="21041" key="FAB-6326" number="6326" project="10002" reporter="tkuhrt" assignee="mastersingh24" creator="tkuhrt" type="10004" summary="README.md license text is confusing" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-09-28 11:44:02.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:14:30.0" resolutiondate="2017-10-17 20:59:22.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="40107"> <description><! CDATA At the bottom of  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric  it shows the README.md file, which states the following for license info: "This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."   Although the separate LICENSE text file contains the Apache license text, downstream users of the project who see the README file may interpret this to say that all of the Hyperledger code is released under Creative Commons Attribution -- rather than just the documentation being CC-BY-4.0, and the code being Apache 2.0. The Hyperledger fabric-chaintool repo is somewhat clearer - see  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaintool  - but could be clarified a bit further.   I'd suggest changing the README.md file for each Hyperledger repo to the following: {quote}Hyperledger Project source code files are made available under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache-2.0), located in the LICENSE file. Hyperledger Project documentation files are made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0), available at  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ .{quote}   This can be used as the license information in the top-level README.md file for fabric, fabric-chaintool and any other Hyperledger codebase. Each codebase should then also contain the Apache 2.0 text in the top-level LICENSE file, as in the fabric codebase as an example.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA More often than not, it is suggested that "this property or the other" should be handled by the higher (application?) layer. While having a secure end-to-end inter/cross-component secure transport layer is key, it seems as if users disable TLS after a few cryptic error messages when they try to setup and configure TLS correctly - which is the less recommended path.  This Epic is intended to group together a few of the main issues that should get resolved in order to make TLS in Fabric "great again". This goes all the way from cipher suit selection, certificate generation/validation, underlying crypto implementation, component configurations all the way to testing, example setups and documentation.   All, please feel free to add sub items/issues/refer to this Epic, comment, etc.    ></description> </Issue>

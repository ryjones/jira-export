This is one of the first tickets I opened, as I really wanted to highlight the importance of using TLS in fabric. Maybe it's my fault for promoting the idea in many discussions (on Slack, etc.) but not marketing this ticket as much - so probably people were not aware of it. Will work on it, thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There would be great to have an ability to use local cryptographic standarts, like russian GOST. As far as i know, the most convnient way to do it - plug through OpenSSL. Maybe there are other ways with Go, but i am not informed enough. Anyway, this feature will be a real enabler or vice versa a huge problem in promoting Fabric if not imoemented.   I didn't create a ticket right now, cause it can be a whole story to discuss and to (re-)work.   ></body> </Action>

Many other TLS-oriented JIRA items were opened (and some got closed) without referencing this Epic. We still need to so some stuff around TLS (some of it was carried out already in 1.0) - I do envision that we&apos;ll need for example the underlying FAB-2974 and others around it. Pushed to the next milestone. If we do not re-use JIRA item, e.g., in v1.1 - I will end up simply closing this.

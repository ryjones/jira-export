CDATA For all channels created by the v1.0.x orderer, the Channel group's {{mod_policy}} was leftÂ unset.  Although the channel is functional, it is not possible to add config elements to the channel level.  Although it would be nice to simply change this behavior in v1.1, unfortunately, because the v1.0 orderers validate that the config computed for the new channel is correct, based on this flawed generation scheme, v1.1 orderers would accept the config as correct, but v1.0 would not.  This could allow the same channel name when referenced on different orderers to have different backing blockchains and is not acceptable.  Therefore, this fix must be gated behind a capability flag.  It is a simple change and so is a good candidate for first user of capabilities flags.  ></description> </Issue>

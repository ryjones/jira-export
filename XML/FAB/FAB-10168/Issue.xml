CDATA Some of the Markdown files are getting overly long, and make submitting changes to them more difficult as it increases the chances of clashing with someone else's changes – case in point, peers/peers.md is now well over 500 lines long, and could easily be subdivided into logical sections.  Markdown itself apparently does not support a basic "include" directive to support this, but this can be implemented using reST, as you can see in the doc file command_ref.rst, which includes lower-level Markdown files:  .. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1  commands/peercommand.md commands/peerchaincode.md commands/peerchannel.md commands/peerversion.md commands/peerlogging.md commands/peernode.md commands/configtxgen.md commands/configtxlator.md commands/cryptogen.md commands/fabric-ca-commands        ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="45572" key="FAB-18055" number="18055" project="10002" reporter="caod" creator="caod" type="10004" summary="Investigate whether peer chaincode actually needs to parse the config for orderer addresses or tls certs" description="The peer chaincode and peer lifecycle chaincode commands call out to  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/4fdb366bb399bc5329cdeb3ccd9d793ae888332e/internal/peer/common/common.go#L175 Â if the orderer address is not passed. This function is currently broken as it only parses the config for the top level orderer addresses instead of checking org level when they exist and the capability is set. The same logic applies for tls certs as well. Given that this code path is likely broken anyways it may be better to enforce the cli properly passes these values instead of trying to parse them from the config and just remove these functions." priority="3" status="10300" created="2020-07-07 21:23:47.0" updated="2020-10-12 14:18:27.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="59474" archived="N"/>

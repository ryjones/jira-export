CDATA In chaincode instead of only GetState() , add support for GetStateMultipleKeys() which would allow for the retrieval of multiple keys from state database in one query.  This would be especially useful for CouchDB since the http roundtrip is slower.  Ledger component already implements GetStateMultipleKeys() however it simply iterates through GetState() requests. As part of this story it should be switched to use CouchDB bulk retrieve API  _all_docs?include_docs=true&attachments=true|http://localhost:15984/myc1/_all_docs?include_docs=true&attachments=true  , which can accept a list of keys as input on the body, enabling the retrieval of multiple keys in a single http roundtrip - see https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/bulk-api.html#post--db-_all_docs  ></description> </Issue>

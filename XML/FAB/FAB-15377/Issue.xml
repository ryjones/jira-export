CDATA Changes made to nwo.Components to defer building binaries that are not needed had the side effect of building needed binaries multiple times across processes.  In particular, the sync.Once for each binary will run once per parallel node as tests execute. That means when begin to run tests in parallel, we will be likely wasting a lot of cycles in the link phase for the binary.  As we don't run most of these tests in parallel right now, this is a low priority item.  /cc  ~btl5037   ></description> </Issue>

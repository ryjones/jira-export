CDATA Just to clarify, the request here is to allow rotating the orderer TLS certificate with the following flow: # update the orderer TLS certificate and key (aka Orderer.General.TLS.Certificate and Orderer.General.TLS.PrivateKey) and restart the orderer (for the new config to take effect) # update the consenters set in the channel config for each channel the orderer is a member of  fabric currently only works with the inverse of that flow.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Rotating certificates in a single node system may be done by using the same TLS key with a renewed cert in the fashion you described.  If you need to change the key, the update must be submitted before restarting the node.  In general, a single node is not supported for production.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="65246" issue="43063" author="btl5037" type="comment" body="We had just bumped from 1.12.5 to 1.13.3 the exact same day 1.13.4 was released. 1.13.3 got caught by Mac&apos;s new Gatekeeper tool requiring all software to be notarized, as it was not notarized. So we pick up that fix which hits anyone who wants to install Go 1.13 on Mac OS Catalina. Historically speaking, the cause for our slow move from Go version to version was the complexity installing it in CI. I recently pushed changes to CI that negate that complexity, so we can bump Go versions as frequently as we wish now. " created="2019-11-04 06:04:53.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2019-11-04 06:04:53.0"/>

CDATA Hi - not sure if you can answer this, but the comment above is apparently the only mention of Mac OSX Catalina in this Fabric Jira site.   I have been trying to set up Fabric release-1.4 on my newish MAC running Catalina, and seem to be getting in trouble with the upgraded Gatekeeper.  I am running with Go1.12.16 darwin/amd64.  I get an error when invoking code that invokes configtxlator/main.go (specifically around lines 44 to 52).  The error I get is  ------------  configtxlator: error: open /dev/stdout: permission denied, try --help  ----------------  Do you know if there is a patch or work-around that I could use to resolve this?  (If not I will probably switch to Ubuntu on Virtualbox).     Thanks  ></body> </Action>

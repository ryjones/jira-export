CDATA   *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client generates an "issue tokens" transaction that is submitted to the system.  Upon receiving this transaction, a committing peer redirects its processing to its  Token specific validation & commit components.  FabToken custom validation ensures that the tokens requested to be issued are of the right form (e.g., of acceptable type), and custom  commit ensures that the transaction creator is authorised to issue tokens.  Upon successful transaction validation and commit, the ledger state is updated to reflect this. The ledger APIs  can be used to retrieve the committed data.   ></description> </Issue>

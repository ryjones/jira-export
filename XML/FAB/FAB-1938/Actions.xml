Can you confirm that this also includes the ability for the peer to support connecting to a list of ordering service instances vs just a single one. The description talks about retrying when the ordering service becomes available and logic around that, but doesn't specifically mention supporting a list of possible instances.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I take we can specify an array of ordering services.  Can we also specify an algorithm for using the ordering service?  Round-robin, random, weighted ?  Timeout parms if the no response?  Thanks, Barry  ></body> </Action>

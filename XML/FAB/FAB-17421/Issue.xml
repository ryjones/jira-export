CDATA On this page https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html for this section https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#hyperledger-fabric-smart-contract-chaincode-sdks  we need to change the SDK language to refer to APIs instead..  So it would read: Hyperledger Fabric smart contract (chaincode)APIs  Hyperledger Fabric offers a number of APIs to support developing smart contracts (chaincode) in various programming languages. Smart contract APIs are available for Go, Node.js, and Java:  Go API documentation * Low-level. * High-level. Node.js API and Node.js API documentation. Java API and Java API documentation.  and the corresponding link to this section would change to: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#hyperledger-fabric-smart-contract-chaincode-apis  We need to add a sentence here that lets the reader know that a compatibility matrix is available in the documentation links.  I need to do an audit of the rest of our documentation to see if we refer to Fabric Chaincode SDK anywhere else in the documentation and update it appropriately.  ></description> </Issue>

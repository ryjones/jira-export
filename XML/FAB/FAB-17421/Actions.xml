CDATA Looks good Pam, thanks :)  1) I would recommend stepping away from referring to "high-level" and "low-level", specifically on the line about Go API documentation. An alternative could be "chaincode" and "contract-api"  2) I would recommend referring to the different language implementations as "contract-apis", so I'm thinking something like:  _Go API documentation chaincode, contract-api_ _Node.js contract API and Node.js contract API documentation._ _Java contract API and Java contract API documentation._  Extra information for clarity: when we're referring to "low-level" in reference to chaincode, we're talking about the *fabric-shim* packages. The "high-level" stuff is in the *fabric-contract-api* packages. For node and java, they live in the same repository; *fabric-chaincode-node* and f*abric-chaincode-java*. For Go, the former lives in *fabric-chaincode-go* and the latter lives in *fabric-contract-api-go*.  Â   When we want to encourage users to use the "high-level", that means we want them to make use of the apis provided by the contract-api. If we don't need to refer to fabric-chaincode-go in this section of the docs, the above could be changed to this:  _Go contract API documentation_ _Node.js contract API and Node.js contract API documentation._ _Java contract API and Java contract API documentation._  Does that make sense? I'm happy to clarify further (it's a whole other ball game for SDKs!) and provide comments/a review for a PR for this, if that's at all useful :)  ></body> </Action>

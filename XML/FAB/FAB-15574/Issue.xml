CDATA 3.0 is a major release boundary.  We have the opportunity to remove features and/or break backwards compatibility on major release boundaries.  While we don't want to overdo this, there are a number of things in the codebase which we should consider removing and/or modifying in order to reduce future technical debt.  Items linked to this epic (FAB-15574) are planned for v3.0 release. See items from v2.0 release at Epic FAB-15337.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Similar to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1141 but with HSM.  Since the bootstrapping Jeff has is in Pyton, I (VP) will likely need to provide some golang tool to generate bccsp Keys (link to self: essentially https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3679/6/cli/server/server_test.go except generate new PEM, not import existing PEM)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Just pushed https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5095/  This gets very close to complete usage for both orderer and peer networks.  Will update as soon as bootstrap is complete.

CDATA I've been playing the rebase game, hoping to save Gari some time in exchange for using mine.  (I think I found a replacement for solitaire as a time-waster -> `git rebase & git push fabric`)  Gari do we want this change? cryptogen is built with `-tags nopkcs11` so I can only assume fabric has no need for pkcs11 and we should move it to a different codebase.  ></body> </Action>

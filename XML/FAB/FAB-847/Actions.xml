CDATA # I think the description here should be revised: we will either adopt a pull model (where the orderers make a call to the bootstrap admin to get the block), or go with what Binh had suggested where the orderer admins have access to the same material as the bootstrap admin (see FAB-665) and they generate the genesis block locally. Of course, that exposes us to issues with deterministic marshaling, so the pull model is probably better. # At any rate, I am not sure why the filesystem location of the genesis block falls into the security domain. If anything, I would expect it to be a ledger-related issue.  I will move this one to the graveyard, as I think the filesystem location is the deliverable here, and it seems a bit small to stand on its own.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Subtasks cannot be moved to epics, so they cannot be moved to the graveyard.  Will mark it as done, to remove it from the view - if you disagree, we'll reinstate it.  ></body> </Action>

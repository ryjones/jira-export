CDATA  ~guoger : Thanks for reporting this, great catch.  We could inspect the last envelope in the last slice of envelopes returned by the blockcutter during the Orderer call and compare it to the just-processed transaction but that would be too expensive.  A better way to address this is to modify the blockcutter.Orderer signature so that it returns one additional boolean, indicating whether there is a non-empty pending batch or not. I am skeptical however because this change is a bit more drastic than I'd like it to be.  Is there an easier, less expensive, more obvious fix that I'm missing?  Also note that no matter how we end up fixing this, we need to backport the fix to 1.0.x as well.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Tim you need to update this issue by describing:  The configuration of the genesis block The configuration of the channel The precise sequence of steps that you followed, edited down to the bare minimum  (In StackOverflow lingo, you need to provide the MWE.)  I suspect that you are using configtxgen which defaults to an AcceptAll policy, hence the behavior that you see, while unfortunate, is justified.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="22808" issue="15704" author="timpii" type="comment" body="Yes - you are correct. We were using the configgentx. As that is the case and you have explained it is the expected behavior then we can close this JIRA item." created="2017-04-21 09:21:16.0" updateauthor="timpii" updated="2017-04-21 09:21:16.0"/>

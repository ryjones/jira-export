CDATA I think that reporting the number of peers that became online, and the number of peers that became offline, and the number of total peers known currently (all 3 metrics via gauges) is a good enough solution.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA More specifically: # Add a function *ReportMetrics(eventName string, count int)* to the  Adapter|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/gossip/gossip/channel/channel.go#L94-L127  interface, that is invoked with: ## "peers_went_online" ## "peers_went_offline" ## "total_peers_known" # Implement the method in the  adapter implementation|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/gossip/gossip/chanstate.go#L117-L188  that works in a similar fashion to the  election adapter implementation|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27708/15/gossip/election/adapter.go@96 .  	  Of course, if someone here has a better idea (Artem/Inbar) - please feel free to say so.  ></body> </Action>

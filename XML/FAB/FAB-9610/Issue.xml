CDATA There are two notable chaincode proto fields which have no actual affect and are in fact a bit nonsensical in v1.0, but we continue to appear to support.  These fields are:  ChaincodeDeploymentSpec // Controls when the chaincode becomes executable. google.protobuf.Timestamp effective_date = 2;  ChaincodeInvocationSpec string id_generation_alg = 2;  The latter is especially troublesome, as the peer CLI still exposes it as an option, with no actual effect.   ></description> </Issue>

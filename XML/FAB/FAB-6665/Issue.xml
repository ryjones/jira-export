CDATA The Jenkins CI job which runs the smoke tests in the fabric-test repo currently hardcodes the commands to setup and run behave smoke tests.  We need to be able to run other tests outside the behave framework, such as performance tests using PTE, and we need to be able to change the list of tests of the smoke test suite without modifying Jenkins jobs. This task is for creating a new regression/smoke folder and a script called runSmokeTestSuite.sh, similar to those for daily test suite. Initially, it should run the behave tests.   Next step is to change the jenkins job(s) so they call this new script instead of calling behave directly. (Or, if the fabric-test/Makefile is implemented, change that to call this new script instead of calling behave directly.), Finally, we can add more tests by adding them to be executed from this new script.  ></description> </Issue>

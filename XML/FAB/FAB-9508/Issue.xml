CDATA The current couchdb image sets the user:group to couchdb:couchdb but does not explicitly set the UID and GID.  This results in the UID and GID being chosen and can conflict with UID/GID already present on the host system.  Normally this is not a problem but in order to allow persistence you need to mount an external volume and want to make sure that you don't accidentally pick up the privileges of an existing user.  The industry seems to be moving towards using the listen port as the UID and GID so we'll do that here as well.  ></description> </Issue>

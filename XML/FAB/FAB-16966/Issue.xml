CDATA The config package in network contains the structures we use to maintain and manage yaml constructs. As long as the production code does not have a user consumable configuration package, we want these to be separate.  So, for external builders, we should actually have a struct within the integration tests instead of using the ones that are in the core/peer pacakge.  ></description> </Issue>

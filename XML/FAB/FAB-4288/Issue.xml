CDATA We want to enhance peer MSP with encryption key provision capability:  * peers identities need to be enhanced with key-material for other nodes to be possible to encrypt information for them * peers need to be able using some seed that resides/is provided to a chain and some pre-distributed key to generate key-material that would allow to encrypt/decrypt information associated to a part of the state on a given channel.  This item refers to the design of the mechanism to allow for such encryption capabilities.  ></description> </Issue>

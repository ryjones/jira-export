CDATA Doing bidirectional proto translation to/from deep JSON requires a significant amount of dynamic programming.  Having each message try to handle this work independently is a recipe for disaster, so the bulk of the reflection work needs to be centralized so that protos may be simply extended with methods which drive the proto translation framework.  This task is to cover designing and implementing this plug-able core reflection framework.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="23077" issue="15298" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Due to resource constraints (no swap space) on the vagrant environment running all the docker containers, it appears that the instantiation of chaincode1 on the 7th channel on peer 3 did succeed after awhile and we were able to query it to get a value (980), but the latest transaction had not yet been delivered to that peer. Since this test and a larger test (100 channels with 10 chaincodes each) passed successfully using vLaunch machine with more resources, we can close this issue due to test environment resource constraints." created="2017-04-27 16:34:30.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2017-04-27 16:34:30.0"/>

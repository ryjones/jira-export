CDATA Caveat: Not sure yet if this is a problem with resources on laptop testbed, or with fabric software. My vagrant ssh terminals responded to some basic commands, but hung forever when tried to clean or make. Opening bug to track and retest.  Found with fabric commit a976c50f. To reproduce, follow instructions https://github.com/ratnakar-asara/e2e to get the e2e_perf tool and execute test with 100 channels, 2 chaincodes, 4 peers: $  ./network_setup.sh  restart  testchan  100  2  4 Total execution time 2909 secs on Lenovo 540 laptop, using vagrant. Tests succeeded on channels 0-6, two chaincodes on each, all 4 peers, and then - the FIRST query on peer 3 fails, which means: - the invoke on peer 0 reduced counter to 990, and was confirmed on peer 0 (for channel 7 chaincode 1), - the invoke on peer 1 reduced counter to 980, and was confirmed on peer 1, - the invoke on peer 2 reduced counter to 970, and was confirmed on peer 2, - the first query on peer 3 (even after waiting 100 secs) still showed the value as 980.   ></description> </Issue>

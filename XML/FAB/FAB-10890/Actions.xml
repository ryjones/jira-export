CDATA Fabric has a very powerful functionality for policies. It is a challenge to make this crystal clear to Fabric architects, administrators and application developers.  I propose to prepare a use case where policies determined by the orgs of the Fabric network as well as policies imposed on the network subjects by government regulations both play a first class role. I furthermore propose to use one or more testcases that are considered relevant by decision makers.  ></body> </Action>

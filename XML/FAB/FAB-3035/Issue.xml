CDATA Just like the fabric-ca project, the fabric-orderer is individual from peer nodes in functionalities.  Using a separate project will improve maintenance with more pluggable consensus implementations, and the deployment architecture would be more clear.  I temporarily mark this to target 1.1, and we can certainly discuss if this would be included in 1.0 release.  Thanks!  ></description> </Issue>

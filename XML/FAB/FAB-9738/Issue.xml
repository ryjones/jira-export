CDATA Current output of each OTE test shows the STDOUT logs from runote.sh, as well as one (or two, when errors) other copies of the entire stdout stream (without newlines, so they are not easily readable). I think these are all coming from 3 places, and were added at different times. We should eliminate the unnecessary duplication:  1. this line in fabric-test/tools/OTE/runote.sh (when the CI picks up this after it is wrapped by python into an xml file):  {code:java} docker cp -a OTE:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE/ote.log ./logs/$\{TESTCASE}.log {code}   2 & 3. these lines in fabric-test/regression/daily/orderer_ote.py:  {code:java} print(result) logfile.write(result) self.assertIn(TEST_PASS_STRING, result) {code}     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA TheÂ install/copy to $GOPATH/bin that was in the gotools-install target was unintentionally changed. Even though the previous mechanism made broken assumptions, the current behavior is just as (if not more) disruptive.  Adding ~/go/bin to the path is not always the right thing so if that's what the docs are saying, they're making assumptions.  Barring any bikeshedding over names (that will eventually result in a change), you can indicate where to install local go tools by setting the GOTOOLS_BINDIR variable when building. {code:java} make gotools GOTOOLS_BINDIR=$HOME/bin{code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Until recently, "make gotools" automatically installed the eight executables in $(GOPATH)/bin, which is why the documentation instructed the user to make sure that directory was on their search path.  With the recent introduction of "gotools.mk", those executables are now simplyÂ placed in ./.build/gotools/bin, which I'm fairly sure is not part of the user's search path, suggesting that anything that required those to be on the search path will now fail.  As a perfect example:  *$ make spelling* *Checking changed go files for spelling errors ...* *xargs: misspell: No such file or directory* *spell checker passed*  So what's the resolution for this?  ></description> </Issue>

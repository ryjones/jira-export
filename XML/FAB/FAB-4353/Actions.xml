CDATA Add a linked list to track unreceived transaction event and event listener option to PTE:  Transaction:  PTE registers a transaction listener to receive a registered transaction event. This is the default event listener.  Block:  PTE registers a block listener to receive every block event on all channels. PTE will parse the received block event for the transactions sent.   None:  PTE will not register any event listener.   ></body> </Action>

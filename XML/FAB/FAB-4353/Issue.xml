CDATA Current PTE EventHUB (for TPS) exploitation limits TPS. We need alternative approach for PTE to capture TPS without impeding max. TPS. Dongming/Jim Zhang suggested the following approaches for consideration: * direct transaction to different peer in the same org and have an eventhub talks to one peer. * have multiple eventhubs to talk to the same peer and have the eventhub know which block is his, then each eventhub will only parse the blocks belong to him  ></description> </Issue>

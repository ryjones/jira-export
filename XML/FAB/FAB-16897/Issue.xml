CDATA The CA Test Engine (fabric-test/tools/CTE/) contains crl_test.sh and mycatest.sh, scripts to test the timings and operations of the CA. Since it only requires code in the CA repository, it belongs not in fabric-test repo but in fabric-ca repo.  The maintainers of fabric-ca may of course make final decision about whether to keep or abandon the tool and when to trigger the scripts. This proposal is to move the CTE tool to the fabric-ca repo, where it can be used by developers to catch errors immediately. We propose also to continue to execute the existing CTE daily test job until an alternative job in fabric-ca is provided to execute these tests.  On master branch AND in release-1.4: * +fabric-ca+:  Add CTE (and any useful parts of the Makefile/Readme information) to fabric-ca repo * +CI+: modify the CI daily job for CTE, to find the scripts in the fabric-ca repo., and to be triggered when appropriate. * +fabric-test+: Remove all references to CTE tool and tests from the Makefile and README and regression/daily/ and regression/smoke/. * +fabric-test+: Remove fabric-test/tools/CTE/.  Refer to the CTE test results of the daily job here:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-ca-master-x86_64/    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Using commit 29d7fc035df697a68d271d628e693c556354486f (I rebased 2/27 morning), I can still see this issue. I attached logs. This time it occurs both with and without using the default channel name, so I wonder if there is something else going on.   orderer0     | 2017-02-27 23:47:16.513 UTC  orderer/kafka  newProducer -> DEBU 078 Connecting to Kafka cluster:  127.0.0.1:9092  orderer0     | panic: Failed to create Kafka producer: kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)   ></body> </Action>

<Action id="24494" issue="14802" author="scottz" type="comment" body="@surya is fixing the OTE tool to work with latest protos and configfiles and TLS, and will rerun most of our bug scenarios maybe next week. However, this one does indeed seem like it has been tested and passes for everyone these days - it is just the process of creating a new named channel in kafka network, requiring communications to be set up correctly with the orderer and the kafka brokers. there is no special requirement to use the OTE tool for this. I think we can agree to close this one." created="2017-05-26 17:56:44.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2017-05-26 17:56:44.0"/>

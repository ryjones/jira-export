CDATA *Q:* Does "peer chaincode install" just add a pointer (link) to my chaincode source code or does it copy the code?  *A*: It grabs your code, packages it, and then puts it into the file system of the peer. In v2.0 it's a tar file of your code, wrapped inside another tar file, IIRC.  *Q:* Where is the compiling done, host system, peer container, smart contract container?  *A:* The compilation is done on demand. When the peer receives a command that is either an invoke or an init (instantiate) and a chaincode container image for the container doesn't exist, it spins another container to compile it, and then creates another chaincode container that is the real chaincode container and puts the compiled binary from the first container, into that second container.  *Q*: Which container does need which volume for accessing my code?  *A:* The chaincode container is self contained and doesn't need to access your source code.  ></body> </Action>

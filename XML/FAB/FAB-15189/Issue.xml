CDATA 1 - Create network input yaml file with all inputs that NL supports and kubernetes cluster related section  2 - Add function to NL to take network input yaml file and read in values from input file  3 - Add ability to read kubeconfig file, to specify and use k8s instead of local network  4 - Generate all config files needed to create pvc, services, yaml to launch fabric. (This and following items will be called by NL. NL already creates docker compose file and configtx yaml file, so it will be similar method to that)  5 - Create pvc and copy certs  6 - Launch network  7 - Query for health of pods (peers, orderers) before returning "success"  8 - Generate connection profile  For example: cd fabric-test/tools/NL go run networkLauncher.go -i "path of networkSpec.yaml file" -k "path of Kube config file" Â   ></description> </Issue>

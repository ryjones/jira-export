CDATA The peer CLI refuses to communicate with an ordering service node that has an expired TLS certificate; you get the following error message: {code:java} Error: failed to create deliver client for orderer: orderer client failed to connect to n23023e-orderingservicenode1-orderer.mycluster-lon02-b3c4x16-9b9c45345f2a063a838d056f9926539a-0000.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud:443: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded {code} This means that it is extremely difficult to submit a config update that updates the consenter sets with the new TLS certificates in order to resolve the problem.  There is a timeshift option in the ordering service that allows the ordering service nodes to communicate with each other, but that does not resolve this problem.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, after https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7199/ was merged, it is possible to restrict the number of channels globally in the system, in order to stop a malicious user from creating an infinite amount of channels.  However, this opens another attack- a malicious user can now create a finite amount of channels, thus preventing from anyone else from creating a channel.  I think it would be good if there could be an additional policy that limits number of channels created to the organization of the creator, so that other organizations would not be effected by the described attack.   ~jyellick   ~kchristidis   ></description> </Issue>

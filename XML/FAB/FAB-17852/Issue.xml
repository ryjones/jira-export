CDATA A blockchain is meant to be a pseudo-immutable, everlasting ledger. It is meant to run forever, without ever coming offline, and never experiencing downtime.  To that end, as System Test, we will test a network by running in a manner consistent with the expectations we have of our consumers running their networks in production. This include monitoring, alerting, scaling, upgrading, trafficking, and maintaining the network just as our consumers do. We will encounter the same issues our consumers experience, such as storage size, and deal with them in the same manner our consumers do.  The intent is that this network should never stop running. By doing this, we will be able to better understand the UX of our consumers and help drive out technical challenges they face, all while asserting that our software behaves in a manner consistent with its intended design.  Outputs of this work will include documentation for features, maintenance, etc., as well writing user stories from our experience to drive new work in Fabric UX.  ></description> </Issue>

Yes, I have been working towards the scenario of someone reading the documentation, and the illustration is placed with its respective content to clarify the concepts. This is the most accessible way as people would use a visual to make sure they are understanding what has just been said, but if that person is blind/low-vision, the concepts are not entirely dependent on graphic representation.  So yes, I was assuming that the text would refer to the image or that the image would clarify what had just been discussed in the documentation.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA see comments on the diagram here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4752?focusedCommentId=26708&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-26708      ~nickgaski   ~joe-alewine   ~markparz  i feel like we're still confusing the viewer with *SDK* (both as an icon and concept). Would *Middleware* or *Server-side* app running HF be a better fit?

CDATA Sean I completely agree.  We need server/side app+SDK and then some sort of client side apparatus to drive your application, then you have smart contracts and fabric entities on the back end.  Honestly the little diagram in the marbles repo is perfect.  Look at "Application Communication Flow"  https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles#application-communication-flow  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We need this diagram to get across concepts, not topology.  Putting in details like server side app etc comes later.  When I write my program, I have no need to know this at all.     And just for perspective, the server side nature would be on the LHS, as that's to do with the structure of the App.  SDK, Server side etc etc are all details that don't need to be mentioned on this diagram.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~odowdaibm :  The text surrounding this graphic seems very API/SDK focused:  {quote}Applications use *APIs* to invoke smart contracts (link) and receive ledger queries and updates. These smart contracts are hosted in the network and identified by name and version.  APIs are accessible with a software development kit (SDK). For purposes of this exercise, we will be using fabric-sdks, though there is also a Java SDK and CLI that can be used to develop applications.  The various components (peers, nodes, containers) of a blockchain network all have separate IP addresses and ports. Applications must know those IP addresses so they can connect to the correct components. {quote} Is that going to change? I can see that I need to make sure to have the endpoints in this one, but should the graphic not address the SDK?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Sarah,     I guess I see it a bit like saying "Program Code" inside the box marked application.  It's just not necessary detail at this point.  Every product I've ever used has an SDK - all programmers know this.  They might call it a library or SDK or service interface ... but it's just mechanics.  There's nothing conceptual.  We can introduce later, but we don't need it on this diagram.     By the same token, I'm absolutely fine having endpoints on this diagram, or deferring them.  The point is that we've got applications, users and their identities.  We've got a network with smart contracts and ledgers.  We've got 2 key interactions - run a smart contract, and get notified when the ledger changes.  That's it.          ></body> </Action>

CDATA I feel like I am missing something. If the introduction of the SDK in the text is not important enough to represent visually, I am not sure why this graphic is necessary—it is repeating the same visuals as the one above it, only with the addition of endpoints (which could just be added to the first).     My main concern is that the graphics are representing things that are not mentioned in the text (like the developer identity) and should someone not be able to see the images, they will not know this part.   ></body> </Action>

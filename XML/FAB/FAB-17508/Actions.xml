CDATA FAB-17547 added a cache to the genesisconfig and localconfig packages to prevent reloading the same configuration in test. This meant we only pay the price of EnhancedExactUnmarshal once per test package.  While this is no longer urgent, the goal of this issue is to try to get underneath why this call is so expensive when the race detector is on and to attempt to address the root cause. No formal analysis has been done to my knowledge.  Alternatively, we are trying to move away from viper so the time may be better spent focusing on that.  ></body> </Action>

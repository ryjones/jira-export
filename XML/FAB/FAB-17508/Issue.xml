CDATA While executing unit tests, each call to EnhancedExactUnmarshal with a reference to genesisconfig.TopLevel takes over 4 seconds to complete. In aggregate, over 1600s (25 minutes) in our tests is spent in this function.  Improving the efficiency of this one function would likely result in a dramatic reduction in the amount of time it takes to execute unit tests.   ^elapsed.csv   ></description> </Issue>

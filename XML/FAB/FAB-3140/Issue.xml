CDATA The GetChannels call of CSCC (Configuration System Chain Code) currently returns only the channel IDs of the channels that the peer has joined.   This call should also return the config block associated with each channel,  or at least add that as an option. This would allow clients/SDKs to efficiently get information related to channels.  ></description> </Issue>

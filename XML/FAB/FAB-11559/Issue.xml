CDATA Some of the functions of ledger depends on chaincode lifecycle. These functions include the following * Fetching collection configuration (e.g., BlockToLive for purging private data) * Maintaining collection configuration history (required by gossip to decide the eligibility of a peer to receive private data for a collection) * Ledger In ledger code many places the assumption is made about how lscc persists its data * Listening for chaincode lifecycle events to create indexes in underlying db * Checking the existence of a collection for validating a simulation request  In the current code, these functions have tight coupling with lscc storage. Now, with new lifecycle, it's better to decouple these functions from how lifecycle code decided to persist it's information in the form of key-values.  ></description> </Issue>

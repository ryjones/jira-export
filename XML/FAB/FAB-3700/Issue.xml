CDATA LSCC takes a channel name as an argument. While strictly should't be required (we need to extract it from the the proposal header) this has been there for a while and is now being exercised. SDKs need to make sure the correct channel name is being sent as LSCC argument to the instantiation.  We will also investigate removing the channel args later.  ></description> </Issue>

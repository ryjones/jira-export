CDATA A number of tests need the fabric repository in order to run successfully. There are chaincode tests that fail due to the missing "/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp" directory.   Also, one of the PTE tests employ a chaincode (sbe_cc in fabric-test/chaincodes/sbe folder) that has external dependency, and using Govendor, it needs the fabric code in the specific directory (src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/). without the fabric directory, govendor fails to do proper vendoring and marks the necessary libraries as missing, as evident when doing a "govendor list".  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently rollback pauses the endorsement til peer reaches the previously highest-ever-seen height.  In some scenarios this may not be desired. For example if orderers are restored from a backup, the peers will never reach their previously highest-ever-seen height, and therefore they must continue to endorse to avoid deadlock.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Followed byfn documentation step by step. Had all pre-reqs met except that I had previous images of v1.1.0-alpha and I did not have GO language installed (missed the step to install) executed byfn.sh script but it failed with errors (for NodeJS as well as GO) that were not helpful to indicate root cause of the failure.  Please see detailed log attached.  Proposed solution: * Check if pre-reqs are met. If not, abort the script with errors stating which pre-reqs are missing. * It would be helpful to have a recovery/cleanup/nuke option to cleanup images (if old images exist on the system) and install compatible images automatically prior to building first network. * It will be helpful if script is backwards compatible (if it's not already).           ></description> </Issue>

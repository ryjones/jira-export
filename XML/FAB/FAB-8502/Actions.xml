CDATA This is the same user scenarioas 8539. The user has previously downloaded images that do not match the version for which this particular byfn script was intended. The error in 8539 is different than the error seen here because the images in 8539 were more backward (using 1.0.x versus v1.1-alpha in this 8502).  We need to figure out a way to prevent users from shooting themselves in foot.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This problem has already been hit with this bug and FAB-8539.  I think FAB-8539 we will see over and over as it is the orderer that will have the first problem in the case of back-leveled docker images.  Here are a few thoughts, could we consider,  a) make the orderer panic have more explicit information like: 'orderer running version x.x and trying to add yyy (capabilities v1.1) b) in the script cut more messages about what version of fabric the script is running c) provide a nuke option as a byfn parm that removes the fabric* images and reloads new ones.

CDATA Let's use FAB-8539 to track this one.Â  It has a CR that does: * Check if pre-reqs are met. If not, abort the script with errors stating which pre-reqs are missing.  I will close this so that we can put all comments in FAB-8539.  ></body> </Action>

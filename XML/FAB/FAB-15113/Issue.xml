CDATA There are multiple errors. The primary one seems to be the failure of the channel creation request because the policy was not satisfied. Recently the policy code in fabric master branch was changed for v2.0, as well as the policies in the configtx.yaml files throughout fabric-test (refer to    https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30429/18/tools/NL/configtx.yaml-in ), so we may need to touch something else in OTE or NL to get this to work. Another point: the NL is used by PTE to create a network, and the PTE test passes.  The output errors from recent merge job   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-merge-x86_64/635/testReport/junit/orderer_ote/OTE_Orderer_Traffic_Engine/test_FAB7936_100tx_3ch_3ord_3kb/   include the following:  {{Creating OTE ...}}{{2019-04-04 22:15:28.418 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001#x1B 0m Endorser and orderer connections initialized Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST – error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'testorgschannel1', could not succesfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: *policy for  Value  /Channel/Capabilities not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied*}}{{ }}  {{2019-04-04 22:15:30.127 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001#x1B 0m Endorser and orderer connections initialized}}  {{Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST – error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'testorgschannel3', could not succesfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for  Value  /Channel/Capabilities not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied}}  {{github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE ./ote.go:234:9: undefined: "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/crypto".LocalSigner}}  {{runtime/cgo exec: "gcc": executable file not found in $PATH}}  {{mv: can't rename 'ote-*.log': No such file or directory}}  {{Error: No such container:path: OTE:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE/ote.log}}{{grep: ./logs/FAB-7936_100tx_3ch_3ord_3kb.log: No such file or directory}}{{./runote.sh: line 355:  : too many arguments Removing OTE ...}}     ></description> </Issue>

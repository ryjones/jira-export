CDATA  ~sambhavdutt  don't create bugs when a verify build is failed. Usually verify build may fail for any reason and if you observe the above error consistently pls file a bug but I observed this is caused by the network error. Same build got passed on the reverify.  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-s390x/515/  ></body> </Action>

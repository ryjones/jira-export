CDATA The following two conflicting CR got merged...   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26135/    https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26221/   and causing the failure of the test -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/committer/txvalidator/validator_test.go#L540.      Without the latter CR, a 'nil' metadata was being returned to the validation code but now instead an error is returned (collection not defined error) that needs to be handled properly in the validation code.  Also, I noticed that though the validation code is restructured in different packages but the code still takes the logger for "vscc" (including the statebased package) that creates problem in debugging.     For now, submitting a CR (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/26266) for skipping this failing test but this Jira can be used for fixing the real issue.     ></description> </Issue>

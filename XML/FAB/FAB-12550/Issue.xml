CDATA The block verification currently uses hash chain validation by verifying the last block and verifying the hash chain of the block batch. However - if a config block exists in among the blocks -  verifying the hash chain isn't enough.      We should therefore verify the hash chain in the following way:  Given a batch of blocks, we detect the first configuration block in the batch, and if it exists - verify that block. Then, to verify the config blocks after it - we build a bundle out of that config block, and so on and so forth.  Eventually we always need to verify the last block, but it will be with using verification rules of the last config block found in the block batch.  ></description> </Issue>

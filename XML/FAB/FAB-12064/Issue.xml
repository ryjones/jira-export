CDATA The golang.org/x/net/context package has added a type alias to the context package when compiling with go 1.9+. This means we can rewrite our imports to use the context package from the standard library.  With this move, {{go vet}} will flag cancel functions that are not called (we have a *lot* of that in our code base) which can result in a context leak.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need to stop using the "master" versions of tools; *dep*, *goimports* and *golint* are the main concerns.  # One option is to publish a "gotools" container version per release / branch. # A second option is to vendor the proper versions and build from there. # A third option is to use the the version aware form of *go get* in Go 1.11 (this approach will only work for master).  ></description> </Issue>

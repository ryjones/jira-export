CDATA Efforts to debug customer issues have uncovered a need for additional capabilities in order to support the product.  Members of our support team could use a tool to change the settings of the logging levels in any or all of the peers, on the fly in a live running network.  This would require a change to fabric code to make these values dynamic, since today an image must be rebuilt with new values for parameters such as CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL. It would also require a pulldown menu or a link on the BlueMix interface, or some sort of hidden access method or tool, to turn on or off the detailed debugging. An alternative (undesirable) would be to run in the most detailed logging mode possible, and store huge amounts of logs for every peer in every network.   ></description> </Issue>

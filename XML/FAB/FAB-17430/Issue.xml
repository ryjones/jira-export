In the new system test framework for k8s, it means changing the test input specification file. In addition, the tools and command functions must all be added. There will likely be many pieces to merge for this." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2020-01-22 21:40:56.0" updated="2020-06-10 03:29:47.0" resolutiondate="2020-06-10 03:29:47.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="58006" archived="N"/>

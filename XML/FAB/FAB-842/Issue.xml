CDATA The new model requires multiple changes to the current CLI, including: # Chaincode life-cycle  supports like deploy, invoke, query, upgrade # Additional admin commands such as logging, status of peer and orderer  We no longer technically require deploy, invoke, query transactions since all are handled by the life-cycle system chaincode, so these various transactions are just function calls on the life-cycle system chaincode.  However, for clarity at the user level, the CLI should provide explicit specification for each deploy, invoke, query, and update.  ></description> </Issue>

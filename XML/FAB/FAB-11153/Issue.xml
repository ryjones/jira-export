CDATA This is one epic from many to follow to allow for token management enablement of Fabric.  Current proposal|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzxoQYARFPTTIM-eIw8zs6tYkg6t6uRVI6fmnCQJz9I/edit?usp=sharing  for the higher level design.  This epic aims at offering a *client-side library for FabToken operations*. The FabToken client wallet library would expose a user-friendly interface to a FabToken application developer that would allow the latter to request a submission on its behalf of a transaction for _issuing or transferring tokens_, or a query for _listing tokens_ etc. To do so, the FabToken client wallet library would leverage calls to the prover peer grpc service as explained in FAB-11149 to construct the low level requests, and a component with a functionality equivalent to the one of client sdk that would integrate the response of the grpc service into a FabToken transaction and submit it to the ordering service.     Adding  ~sykesm ,  ~angelo.decaro ,  ~mathiasb303 ,  ~KaoutarEL   ~jyellick ,  ~denyeart .  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Introduce customized default couchdb local.ini configuration for the fabric-couchdb docker image.  Primary this is for security configuration, but some other configurations are also needed for performance optimizations, such as delayed_commits and compressible_types.  User security will initially be disabled in local.ini, but an example of commented out security configuration will be provided, so that consumers can easily enable security.  Corresponding changes for user security in peer tests/config will also be highlighted but commented out.  This work item simply sets the foundation for user security by introducing the local.ini default configuration. We may decide to enable user security in the default configuration in a later work item.    ></description> </Issue>

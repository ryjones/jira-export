CDATA The workflow associated with modifying configuration is as follows. # Client fetches current config. # Client modifies a copy of the current config. # Client computes an update to transition between the current, and modified config. # Client collects signatures for the update. # (Optional) Client validates that the config update will apply successfully. # Client submits update for ordering  Steps 2, 3, 4, and 6 may all be accomplished with relative ease by the SDKs or CLI. However, steps (1) and (5) require some new API support from the peer.  Two options for implementing this API have been discussed.  # Implementing as a new gRPC service with functions which take a {{common.Envelope}} as parameter. # Implementing as a function on an existing (or new) system chaincode using the existing chaincode APIs.  There has already been some extensive discussion in the parent item around which of these approaches should be used, starting with:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6042?focusedCommentId=34326&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-34326  and (hopefully) ending at:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6042?focusedCommentId=34434&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-34434  ></description> </Issue>

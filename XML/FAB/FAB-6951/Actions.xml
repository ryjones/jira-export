CDATA In typical fashion, we never really completed the vote for this one, and I know coding for this is already underway, but let the record show that I'm voting for option 2, as I'd like us to stick a message-based protocol.  I think that both the service and its API (Endorser and ProcessProposal respectively) are incorrectly named and should be renamed to something way more generic, but that is something that we can tackle later on, if there is enough agreement.  So +1 for Option 2.  ></body> </Action>

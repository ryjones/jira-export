CDATA The orderer's config   general.genesisfile was used in solo and kafka mode, as in both mode it requires a new orderer to start from the beginning genesis block.  However, in terms of the raft consensus, the bootstrap block can not only be a genesis block, but also (more popular) be a latest config block.  Hence we should use bootstrap file to replace the genesis file for avoid confusion.     There can be further revision on the genesis method, but we can consider to do it in another separate patchset if needed.  ></description> </Issue>

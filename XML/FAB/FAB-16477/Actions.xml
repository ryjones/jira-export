CDATA It's very confusing that the 'Genesis'Method of type file uses a 'Bootstrap'File config option whose default value is 'genesis'block. We've changed only one of the three names from 'genesis' to bootstrap', and now people won't be able to associate these options together. I realize that was done in a prior CR and should have mentioned there.  Also, nobody will know that the default value is 'genesisblock' since it has been removed from the yaml, and is not an intuitive default name for a 'BootstrapFile'.  I think the whole change to BootstrapFile needs to be reconsidered... if we want to proceed with the change, it should be changed consistently.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Looks like there is a Part2 Jira / CR to get to the consistent naming:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/34437/   I'm good with that, as long as we mention in release notes.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~SjirNijssen   ~EdProsser   ~mbwhite       Hello guys, Just an awareness on this topic – the tutorial for commercial paper.  I'll base it on Matthew's tutorial here:  https://github.com/ampretia/fabric-application-examples/blob/europa/docs/Running-Commercial-Paper-Contract.md      It's take a couple of patches before it's ready to review, but please feel free to add comments as necessary. Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

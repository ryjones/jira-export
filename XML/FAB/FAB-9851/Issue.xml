CDATA In v1.1, the private data feature within a channel is an experimental feature. Hence, one needs to set privateChannelData capability in channel config to enable it. In v1.2, private data feature is going to be enabled by default, i.e., non-experimental.   As a result, privateChannelData() capability API in v1.2 should return (privateChannelData || v1.2) to support rolling upgrades. In v1.3, we can remove the privateChannelData capability flag.    ></description> </Issue>

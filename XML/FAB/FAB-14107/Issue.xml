CDATA How does one know when the `init` call is complete, other than looking for the chaincode container?  With the previous workflow, it was possible to check for the instantiated chaincodes (peer chaincode list --instantiated). Since instantiation is not "a thing" with the new lifecycle this call does not work for filling this gap.   ></description> </Issue>

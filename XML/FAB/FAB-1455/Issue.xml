CDATA Parameterizing `unit-test/run.sh` to optionally pass in the package(s) you want to test rather than running unit tests for the whole fabric will make local development and test more palatable  So generally I build and test all my changes natively on my host (i.e. I just run `go test` directly on my host system)  and then when things look good I then run `make unit-tests` locally (although I do forget sometimes) before submitted by patch for review  There are of course times when `go test` runs fine locally but then when run in the context of `make unit-tests` it fails for one reason or another.   `make unit-tests` takes a while to run so this is a pain (as others have stated).  So one thing I've been doing locally is modifying `unit-test/run.sh` locally to only run the unit tests for the package(s) I've changed to quickly ensure that things work.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~denyeart  thx Dave for reporting this... that CR only solves conflicting port, but not conflicting leveldb resource. I'll dig into it and push another CR.  Although, i'm generally no a fan of mixing this integration-test-like tests with other UTs. we will likely keep building code around it to avoid conflicts, and end up with another nwo, which can be executed in parallel...  thoughts?  ~sykesm   ~yacovm   ></body> </Action>

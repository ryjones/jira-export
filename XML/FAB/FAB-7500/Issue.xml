CDATA Since new API ledger API was introduced in order to support FAB-1151, e.g.   {code} 	// CommitWithPvtData commits the block and the corresponding pvt data in an atomic operation 	CommitWithPvtData(blockAndPvtdata *BlockAndPvtData) error {code}  and production code path stopped to use previous {{Commit}} API, following code of the committer is no longer needed and could be removed:  {code} // Commit commits blcock to into the ledger // Note, it is important that this always be called serially func (lc *LedgerCommitter) Commit(block *common.Block) error { 	// Do validation and whatever needed before 	// committing new block 	if err := lc.preCommit(block); err != nil { 		return err 	}  	// Committing new block 	if err := lc.PeerLedger.CommitWithPvtData(&ledger.BlockAndPvtData{Block: block}); err != nil { 		return err 	}  	// post commit actions, such as event publishing 	lc.postCommit(block)  	return nil } {code}  As well as following {{TODO}} labels in the committed code no more relevant, since resolved:  {code} 	// TODO: Need to validate the hashes of private data with those in the block {code}  and   {code} // TODO: Need to create filter based on chaincode collections policies {code}  ></description> </Issue>

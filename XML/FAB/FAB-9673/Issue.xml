CDATA Now we have basic MSP and Idemix MSP. In the future, we may have additional types of MSP. e.g. x509 certificate processing in golang doesn't support some regional standard crypto algorithms, so another MSP need to be implemented.    To avoid code invasion, we can leverage support for Go-based plugins to implement a "plugin" MSP.  Just like  FAB-6189  Implement bccsp plugin   The plugin provider will be simple: - implement the msp interface - config will take a path to a plugin module as well as a raw map string interface\{}  The provider will load the plugin and simply call the matching exported methods.  ></description> </Issue>

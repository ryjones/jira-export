CDATA *Setup*:  Network Topology: 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels. CouchDB as StateDB, endorsement policy is 2-Org AND.  Client Driver: PTE *Test Steps*: 1) *chaincode*: each channel has one chaincode,  (EndorsementCC), instantiated 2) *100K transactions (initial phase)* 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 invokes concurrently. thread 1 and 2 to set key values only and no SBEP, thread 2 and 4 to set both value and SBEP   thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1 thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1 thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2 thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2 3) *100K transactions (test phase)* 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 invokes concurrently. All 4 threads to update the values only. *Result*: 1)hardware setup 2) TPS (invokes per second) achieved for step 3 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This actually looks fairly straightforward to implement to me.  On consenter stop, we simply need to call into {{TrackChain}} and let the normal replication stuff take over.  Note, today, the replication expects a block as input.  This is very misleading, as if the chain already exists, this block is ultimately (mostly) ignored.  The requirement is that the block containing the channel creation transaction but the input, but, instead in the idle chain case, we are passing in the genesis block (which is wrong).  The replicator API should also be fixed to accept a nil block if the chain already exists.  ></body> </Action>

The replicator API should also be fixed to accept a nil block if the chain already exists. Just to confirm i understand you correctly, do you mean {{TrackChain}} API here? and when it's nil, which implies that particular channel used to exist and the node should have its ledger, and simply skip appending genesis block.  Also, i think there's slightly more work to do. I think we should replace the etcdraft.chain in registrar with inactive.chain, so broadcast clients would get proper error {{this channel is not serviced by me}} instead of {{channel halted}}   ~jyellick   ></body> </Action>

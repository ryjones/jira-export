CDATA I ran chaincode-2-chaincode query interface test using example02, example04 on Fabric-CI Images - 4th March. 1 thing I noticed and as per https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces.go#L57 - Invoke operation containing PutState will not be recorded to the ledger (irrespective if chaincode is running on the same or different channel of the same peer). And this is what I see as expected.  However looking at the go test written for example04 at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example04/chaincode_example04_test.go#L109, the invoke operation containing PutState (transfer 10 unit from A -> B ) gets registered/committed in mock-stub implementation. This need to be corrected.  ></description> </Issue>

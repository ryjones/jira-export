CDATA On Kafka (setting the KAFKA environment variables), 1MB, 1.5MB works fine.   Kafka environment variables set to: - KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES=103809024 - KAFKA_REPLICA_FETCH_MAX_BYTES=103809024 - KAFKA_REPLICA_FETCH_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES=103809024  *2MB* has problems on the query. When looking through the peer and orderer logs, there are no errors. The error comes from the sdk during a query. The error is the same as mentioned in the above comment: {code} error:  client-utils.js : sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Received message larger than max (4195347 vs. 4194304) at /home/itpc/experims/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/grpc/src/node/src/client.js:434:17 error:  client-utils.js : sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Received message larger than max (4195347 vs. 4194304) at /home/itpc/experims/fabric-sdk-node/node_modules/grpc/src/node/src/client.js:434:17 Error: Received message larger than max (4195347 vs. 4194304) Error: Received message larger than max (4195347 vs. 4194304) {code}  What is strange is the message size reported is twice as much as the actual payload.   ></body> </Action>

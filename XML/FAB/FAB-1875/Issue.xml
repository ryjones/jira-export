CDATA There is an existing problem with syncing identity across channels.  # Application orgs cannot read the ordering system channel, so they cannot reasonably update their identity there. # Application orgs cannot determine what channels they are a member of, so cannot easily script updates to their identity.  Further, because the identity may be at different levels and will definitely have different headers, one signature must be generated per channel. # The orderer has no way to ensure that the MSP used in a channel creation request is up to date (except relative to the ordering system channel, which as already pointed out, is problematic to update). # The orderer has no centralized place to get TLS certs from. # The peer has no authoritative source for TLS certs or for local MSP data. # If an application wishes to create a channel with an org they have no other channels with, it's not obvious how to retrieve their current MSP.  There are probably other benefits as well.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Add a sample of how to use a fungible token in Chaincode. This Chaincode is a sample implementation of  ERC20 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), which is a standard interface of tokens in Ethereum.  ERC20 provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. Most of major tokens on the Ethereum are ERC20 compliant.  The functionality defined by ERC20 is also useful for Chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric. Since ERC20 is a specification of token interfaces, it can be implemented by any blockchain software. Thie sample shows the ERC20 for Hyperledger Fabric so that we can use the major token protocol.  ></description> </Issue>

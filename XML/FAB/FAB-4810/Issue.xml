(1) This will launch the network with the configuration mentioned below, starts the deliver clients first and each client will be connected to each orderer, starts broadcast clients for each orderer and starts sending the traffic to the orderers. (2) Using a separate thread, pause the first orderer, wait for 30 seconds, and then unpause it, waiting for 1 minute period, followed by pausing other orderers (3) Reconnect the broadcast clients to send the transactions and deliver clients to receive both before and after the orderer restarted *  *Artifact Locations*: fabric/test/tools/OTE * *Network Topology*: 3 orderers, 4 kafka brokers, 3 zookeepers, 2 orgs with 2 peers in each * *Client Driver*: OTE * *Input*: go test -run ORD104 -timeout 50m * *Output*: if the test ran successfully, should be able to see pass as the output  ></description> </Issue>

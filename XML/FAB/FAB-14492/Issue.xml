CDATA Acceptance:  I can drop a {{build}} script the peer's local file system next to the {{detect}} script. When the {{detect}} script  exits successfully, the {{build}} script will be called. The arguments to the build script should be the extracted contents of the chaincode package, a directory to place chaincode metadata for the peer (ie. CouchDB index files), and a directory to place assets that may be needed to launch chaincode.  If the {{build}} script exits abnormally, the build process has failed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The committer currently only works with solo to support the skeleton path. We need to generalize it with the following:  # As an object to be instantiated by the gossip to handle incoming blocks on a channel (1 committer object per channel) # Process block of transactions, where each transaction type associated with a system chaincode, call the system chaincode to process the transaction (the association is declared in the yaml system chaincode section) # For CHAINCODE type, call the chaincode's VSCC to validate the transaction # Handle invalid transactions (have a policy on whether to store or not;  default is not to store) # Commit block to ledger # Emit events if any  We probably need a queue here to hold the blocks to be processed.  ></description> </Issue>

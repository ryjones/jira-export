<Action id="51925" issue="34506" author="scottz" type="comment" body="This is not a bug. Two reasons for the additional time: I added some tests to the daily test suite a few days ago. And, quite a few tests were not being executed (all tests in the peer and orderer feature files) for a long time because of another error causing the behave daily build to fail and abort prematurely. Build 44 is when that other problem was fixed and we started executing those tests again." created="2018-10-09 14:54:57.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-10-09 14:54:57.0"/>

CDATA No bug is causing the increase in tests duration. Simply put, more tests are running now.  In coming weeks, we can reduce overall time , using another task, to replace builds with pulls.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Things to consider for this change: - pull images instead of building images - refine what tests are executed - are we already executing the tests elsewhere? - evaluate where the bottlenecks seem to be located in the tests - consider polling for when a chaincode is installed and instantiated instead of waiting for a set period of time and assuming that it is complete by then - shorten the wait time for a network to be in a ready state before considering the test a failure (currently set to 5 minutes)  ></body> </Action>

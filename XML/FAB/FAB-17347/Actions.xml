<Action id="66710" issue="43924" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Watch for signs of FAB-12204 (peer panics when trying to rebuild indexes), which we observed in 1.3. If memory serves, the panics were due to limited resources (memory and/or cpu) during the rebuild process while traffic running, and went away when run on a k8s system with more resources. Today there should be more error logs indicating the cause clearly, if observed at all." created="2020-01-15 20:36:32.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2020-01-15 20:36:32.0"/>

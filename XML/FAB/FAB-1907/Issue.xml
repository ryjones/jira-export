CDATA Standard operation of the tool code is to use one producer per orderer per channel, and one consumer per orderer per channel. That could be a lot of go threads, when we add lots of channels, especially if there are several orderers. And remember each orderer gets its own docker container too, which slows things down when testing on a single laptop. Some flexibility is desired.  1. One idea is to add a feature to allow adding a special master consumer who could connect to all channels (on any one orderer). 2. Another feature is to provide an option to create ONLY one producer and one consumer, which will connect to every channel on each orderer. This would allow testing with LOTS of channels, without creating so many go threads.  ></description> </Issue>

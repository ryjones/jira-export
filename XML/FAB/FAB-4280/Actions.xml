CDATA  ~bmos299   ~JonathanLevi   I think we'll want somebody from the test lab to prepare for (semi) automated test of release artifacts.  That is, once release artifacts are uploaded for a specific release (e.g. beta), we'll want the ability in a repeatable/semi-automated way to test the download of the artifacts, installation of the artifacts, and execution (e2e sample) of the artifacts, across all supported platforms, before we announce their availability.  Of course, this should all be tested prior to the final upload, but we'll want to have the repeatable/semi-automated process and environments in place so that we can do a quick trial of the final upload with quick turnaround. Barry, could you nominate somebody from test lab to lead this activity?  FAB-4275 is for preparation of release artifact testing.  FAB-4280 is for execution of release artifact testing for beta release.  ></body> </Action>

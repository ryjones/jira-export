CDATA We compiled upgrade documentation objectives with SVT team:  High level upgrade steps for Fabric, Fabric CA, dependency docker containers, binaries, SDKs. Required versus recommended sequencing of upgrade steps - major components, and nodes within network and orgs. Consumer friendly instructions. e.g. how exactly to upgrade capabilities? how to delete chaincode images? Compatibility matrix for all components. e.g. is any mix of 1.0 and 1.1 components supported, or are there limitations such as 1.1 SDK cannot work with 1.0 Fabric?  specific concerns:  Jeff's current kafka service upgrade is not a rolling upgrade of orderer service. We should check kafka website for recommendations, and combine with orderers upgrade process steps and rework with jeff  Jeff restarts peer after upgrading its binary, not the whole the image; it is not clear: does that include env variables setting them at runtime behind the scenes?  ></body> </Action>

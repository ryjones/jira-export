CDATA Currently, the gossip code panics if it's unable to sign a message or to marshal it bytes, because the assumption was  * If the signing failed then something is terrible wrong with the peer and it's not recoverable * If turning a message into bytes fails, it's because of something not recoverable too.   However, a user posted a stack trace in which gossip tried constructing a message that its envelope has a payload of 2GB.  In order to prevent these kind of problems, and the crash of the peer, we need to make the Signer return an error instead of panicking.  ></description> </Issue>

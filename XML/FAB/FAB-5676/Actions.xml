CDATA  ~greg.haskins   ~muralisr  I think this is related to FAB-5177 where we wanted to remove peer layer dependency. Should we pull FAB-5177 into v1.1 ?  Regarding this one,  ~denyeart , looking at the logic, during upgrade, the peer's chaincode containers will shutdown due to broken connection. When the new peer is up, it will start up cc container on demand. Since the chaincode vendors the shim, changes on chaincode won't happen unless it is upgraded.   ></body> </Action>

Perhaps a simple approach is to shut down any chaincode after a configured inactivity period. This would automatically clear out the old versions when no longer used." created="2017-08-21 13:52:19.0" updateauthor="binhn" updated="2017-08-21 13:52:19.0"/>

CDATA IMHO, there will be several thing we should consider:  1. Put a container into unresponsive status incase starting by any invocation, before operation.  2. when upgrading the shim layer, if we simply stop and delete the old images/containers, there will be some interruption delay that the peer stops work. While if we just let the shim layer loaded dynamically, e.g., using golang plugin, then the interruption time can be reduced to nearly ignore.     Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

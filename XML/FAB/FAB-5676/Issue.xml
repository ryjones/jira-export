CDATA Upon upgrade of peer, in order for shim in chaincode container to get the latest fixes and be compatible with peer, the chaincode docker image should get rebuilt based on upgraded shim code.  Otherwise you will be running an outdated shim against an upgraded peer.  - Would need to add Delete of container images. Note - could get ancestor of container to check version, and delete image accordingly. - This would fix things if you don’t vendor shim in chaincode. - If you vendor shim into chaicode, you have to upgrade chaincode regardless.  ></description> </Issue>

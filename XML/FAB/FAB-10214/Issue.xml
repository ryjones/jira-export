CDATA The idemix APIs should hide the use of protobufs in its APIs. It can do this by: a) adding XXXToBytes and XXXFromBytes functions for all XXXobjects that are returned.  This allows fabric CA to serialize/deserialize these objects over the wire or when persisting them.  An example is the IssuerKey which fabric CA needs to persist. b) not use any explicit protobuf structs in any of its function signatures, but just define types such as type IdemixIssuerKey interface{} func NewIssuerKey(...) (IdemixIssuerKey, error)  ></description> </Issue>

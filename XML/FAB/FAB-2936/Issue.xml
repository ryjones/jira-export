CDATA This is the first in a series of changesets that will allow us to quickly query the state of the Kafka cluster. This is itself needed so that we can decide whether there's a point in repeating a certain request (e.g. for the creation of a channel/partition in Kafka) or not.  We're vendoring the latest version of the sarama library because it introduces the `Brokers()` method to the `Client` interface, and this allows us to easily get the list of active brokers.  This changeset also adds a relevant (and now req'd) config setting, see: https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/issues/816 for more.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This is a lower priority item that can be detached from the parent as a separate chore if needed.  The prover peer is responsible for handling a small number of different kinds of commands requests. In support of these, each command can have its own processor that manages validation, parsing, execution, and response.  We can choose to implement this in a middleware style invocation chain or as commands that encapsulate the request and use independently tested components.

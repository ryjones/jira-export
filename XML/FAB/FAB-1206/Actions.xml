CDATA Hi  ~muralisr , I do not believe we have replay attack protection on the orderer side, but only on the committing peer side. Protecting orderers from replays is not critical since duplicate transactions will have conflicts in read/write sets and same txid sets and will not be considered for processing by committing peers. We can add this feature later, that could slightly increase the performance of ordering.   For now marking this for v1.1.  ></body> </Action>

We are still discussing what&apos;s the best way to achieve that given that the ordering service is not supposed to store the entire ledger necessarily. Therefore, we need some other mechanisms to put in place. I will keep you up-to-date on this. Thanks for the reminder, anyway." created="2017-07-28 00:45:42.0" updateauthor="angelo.decaro" updated="2017-07-28 00:45:42.0"/>

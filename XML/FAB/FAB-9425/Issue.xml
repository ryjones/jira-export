CDATA From J. Yellick  An orderer org may be part of the consortium, but as a best practices, I would suggest that they should not. Even if the same organization is running both ordering and transacting in the consortium, I would suggest it as best practice that they use different MSPs for each so that the default block validation policies and channel reader policies etc. work as expected for clients acting in a non-orderer role.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~odowdaibm  I had the same thought, but ultimately decided to create it's own JIRA since Jason requested it and we could easily track it's completion that way. If you prefer to add the comment to FAB-9338 and close this out I defer to your judgement.  Either way is fine with me.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA This one has been address in the updated MSP Key Concepts topic.   Every organization participating in a channel must have an MSP defined for it**. In fact, it is recommended that there is a one-to-one mapping between organizations and MSPs.  and   Finally, OUs could be used by different organizations in a consortium to distinguish each other. But in such cases, the different organizations have to use the same Root CAs and Intermediate CAs for their chain of trust, and assign the OU field to identify members of each organization. When every organization has the same CA or chain of trust, this makes the system more centralized than what might be desirable and therefore deserves careful consideration on a blockchain network.  ></body> </Action>

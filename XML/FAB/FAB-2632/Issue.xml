CDATA When a chaincode is instantiated on a channel, we do something like  peer chaincode instantiate -C mych -n mycc -v 1.0 -p example02 -c '{"Args": "init","a","100","b","200" }' -P "OR ('Org0MSP.member','Org1MSP.member')"  -P is optional, and so in the LCCC, we do (line 518)  		if len(args) > 3 && args 3  != nil { 			policy = args 3  		} else { 			// FIXME: temporary workaround until all SDKs provide a policy 			policy = utils.MarshalOrPanic(cauthdsl.SignedByMspMember("DEFAULT")) 		} I think that FIXME really needs to be fixed because cauthdsl.SignedByMspMember("DEFAULT") is not correct. There is no orgs with ID = DEFAULT.  What we wanted to say was "signed by any valid members of the channel".   ~ellaki  suggested that we should use the peer MSPs writers.  Note that this is not safe for production, and we should log a warning when chaincode has no endorsement policy specified. It is to make it easier for development.   ></description> </Issue>

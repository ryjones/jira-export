CDATA There's a problem with defaulting to the ChannelApplicationWriters policy. The problem is that due to the chaincode-nature of lccc, policies need to be specified as bytes. The code currently serializes a *cb.SignaturePolicyEnvelope object into bytes which is how policies are set at deploy time and stored by lccc. Later at validation time, vscc queries lccc and extracts bytes which it deserializes back to a *cb.SignaturePolicyEnvelope. So we always need policies as serialized *cb.SignaturePolicyEnvelope objects. However, ChannelApplicationWriters is a different struct and can't be serialized into a *cb.SignaturePolicyEnvelope.  The alternative solution that we propose is to default to the following policy: a signature from a member of any of the MSPs specified for the application of the channel.  ></body> </Action>

Is it required for 1.0.0?  ></body> </Action>

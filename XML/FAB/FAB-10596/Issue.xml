CDATA Currently each chaincode platform is implemented as aÂ package under {{core/chaincode/platforms}}. Each chaincode platform implements the {{Platform}} interface.  Whilst looking for the chaincode platform specific chaincode start commands, I found that this was implemented elsewhere in a big {{if}} block in {{ContainerRuntime.LaunchConfig}}.  It would be easier to find and cleaner if the chaincode start command was in the chaincode platform specific code instead!  ></description> </Issue>

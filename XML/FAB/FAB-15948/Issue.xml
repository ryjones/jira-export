CDATA Keeping with the general pattern of {{fabric-chaincode-_language_}}, create a {{fabric-chaincode-go}} repository that will hold user consumable chaincode packages.  The repostiory should be updated with the typical boilerplate license, readme, contributing, etc.  This repository should be a v0 (unversioned) go module and should include {{go.mod}} and {{go.sum}} files but should *not* contain vendored dependencies. The goal is for this code to be consumed as a library by chaincode processes and we want to provide as much flexibility as possible.  Discussion: gerrit with github mirror? If gerrit, NACR review policy using the same maintainer list as fabric.  Acceptance: 1. I can build a chaincode program outside of a GOPATH that uses the shim from {{fabric-chaincode-go}}. 2. I can build a chaincode program within a GOPATH that explicitly vendors the shim from fabric-chaincode-go.  ></description> </Issue>

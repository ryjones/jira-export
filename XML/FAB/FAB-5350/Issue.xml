CDATA The MSP Identity Identifier consists of the MSP id and the Hash of the identity's certificate.  Currently, it is computed before the certificate sanitisation. So, an attacker can still hope to present itself with two valid identities to the network.  So far, Fabric does not use the Identity Identifier to reason about access control so the above does not constitute an issue. It anyway needs to be fixed in order to allow to reason about Identity Identifiers in a safe way,   This change is required to be able to add caching mechanisms to MSP to improve performances.   ~ellaki ,  ~ales , please, have your say :)   ></description> </Issue>

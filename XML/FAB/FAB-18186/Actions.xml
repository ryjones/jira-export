CDATA Manish is correct that the strategic way will be to snapshot a good peer's channel and then re-join the channel from the good snapshot, as opposed to resetting all the bad peer's channels. However it will take some time for users to shift over to snapshot approach. Also in some situations there may be no 'good' snapshot to use as the basis.     ></body> </Action>

Can I change the Status BACKLOG to TO DO? Originally the status was BACKLOG. I changed it already, but I'm not sure that was a correct procedure.  2. To fix the  SC2207|https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2207  warning of run-integration-test.sh, we have to write codes for bash 4.x and 3.x+; Because Fabric works on both 4.x and 3.x (for example, bash version of Ubuntu Linux 14.04 is 4.3, bash version of Mac OS X is 3.x.) I think this is verbose. Do you have any idea what should I fix this warning?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA How can I run run-integration-tests.sh? I need to check run-integration-tests.sh works properly.

CDATA In regards to your questions: # Yes you can change the status from Backlog to To DO. If you are currently working on it you can also change to In Progress. # I think the approach you have the works for bash 3.x and 4.x is the best option. # Running integration tests is done as you mention `make integration-test`. What is the error message you are seeing?  ></body> </Action>

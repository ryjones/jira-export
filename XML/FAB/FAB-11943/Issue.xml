CDATA Rework TMS verifier produced in another JIRA to leverage lookups and writes to the ledger (simulator).   Here a module that offers a GetState/PutState capabilities is defined within the TMS verifier infrastructure to allow the latter to retrieve ledger state (to do certain security checks), and to perform ledger updates at commit time.

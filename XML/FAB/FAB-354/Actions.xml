CDATA For (external) doc:   Is this more precisely a Hyperledger Fabric Cryptographic Service Provider (HFCSP) than a Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP)? (Once we document externally we don't want to subsequently change names.)  Can we identify / name the specific cryptographic APIs that are supported, or example choices? And same for the Hardware Service Modules (HSMs) supported. I would imagine there are restrictions on the specific choices, at some level.  The design states that interoperability between different APIs, as they are pluggable/potentially variable by HL component, is not necessarily guaranteed; what should we say about that - the specific risks / implications.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

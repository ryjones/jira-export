CDATA  ~wlahti  We can help you here in adding integration tests in fabric CI process. But I have few questions before we start working on this.. # Do we need a new job for this? like we have in fabric build process mentioned here  http://ci-management1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_ci_process.html#build-process  # If we need a new job, do you want me to run this job parallel to smoke test job? # I have to ask LF (Linux Foundation) team to create a new label for Integration test.  Once you confirm will work on this.  ></body> </Action>

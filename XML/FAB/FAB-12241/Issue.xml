CDATA The system behave tests perform a "npm install" every time the Node SDK is used. Time can be saved and consistency ensured by performing an "npm install" once at the beginning of the test suite, then whenever the Node SDK is used, the node_modules directory is already in place.   Care must also be taken to ensure that the node_modules directory is not deleted at the end of each test run.  Performing this change will shave minutes off of the smoke and daily test runs.  ></description> </Issue>

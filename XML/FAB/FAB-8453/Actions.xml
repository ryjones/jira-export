However, not sure it makes sense to lift the "." limitation in the code, mostly cause not sure where else a "." is used as delimiter in the policy language.  Therefore, I would only add documentation on the limitations on the msp identifier and allow the error message be more accurate.  ~denyeart  what would be a good place to add such documentation?  Thanks!     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Elli, first I suggest discuss with the policy language experts and determine if dots can be supported. It seems like it should be possible to look for the role (e.g. *.member) by allowing multiple dots and picking the role off of the last segment.  As the example above illustrates, having dots in MSPIDs may be a common request.  Adding such support would likely be a 1.2 item though.    For 1.1, maybe the best thing would be to mention the current restriction in the comments in the configtx.yaml sample, I think that's where most people would see it, and would be most easy to revert if we decide to support dots in 1.2.  If we decide the restriction should be permanent, I think the right place to document the MSP naming rules is here: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/msp.html  I assume that doc will remain as-is even after the MSP conceptual doc is merged: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17505/  Finally, If we decide the restriction should be permanent, I think configtxgen needs to validate MSPIDs based on the naming rules.  I think just the configtx.yaml sample could be updated to resolve the immediate 1.1 defect, and then create follow-on Jira items for 1.2 based on the decision of whether to support dots in the future.  ></body> </Action>

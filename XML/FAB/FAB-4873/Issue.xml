CDATA FAB-4243 has shown that high concurrency environments can run into issues due to the large number of http connections between peer and CouchDB.Â  While configuration updates on the OS and CouchDB can be made to handle the large number of connections, it would also be valuable to better control and manage the connections from the peer.  Two ideas:  1) For the committer logic, since it is the most critical peer role, utilize a dedicated connection to CouchDB to reduce the chance of connection errors.  2) For the endorser logic, since it is not as critical as the committer, utilize a connection pool, so that endorsement requests for the database queue up (and eventually time out) rather than hitting connection errors immediately, when there are many concurrent requests.  ></description> </Issue>

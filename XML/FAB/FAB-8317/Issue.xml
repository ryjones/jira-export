CDATA *Problem area:* Existing Jenkins verify & merge jobs always clone the “parent commit” & GERRIT_REFSPEC from the patch set submitted by the developer not against the HEAD.   - This approach reminds maintainer to rebase the patch before merge, as it is not fetching patch set against the latest commit from the repository.  - When a build reference is changed in CI (like adding a new make target or update name of the target) or when a new file is added (ex: ci.properties), developers have to rebase all their submitted patches. This wastes build resources also this approach takes developer time to analyze the error.  *Proposed Solution:*  Every verify and merge patch clones the parent commit HEAD, fetch the GERRIT_REFSPEC & checkout to FETCH_HEAD.  *Benefit with this solution:*  Irrespective of the parent commit of the patch, the proposed approach catch the integration issues in the early stage of the patch verification and can avoid rebase issues.  saves build resources.  ></description> </Issue>

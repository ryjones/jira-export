CDATA One of the metrics we want to poll from the snapshot generation is how long it took to generate the snapshot. The output of the snapshot generation will be a success response and the time to generate.  PTE should use the Docker/Kubernetes SDK to pull the logs and monitor both the start and end times of the transaction in the logs. Once both are available and the snapshot was successful, PTE will exit with a success or failure, and if the exit was a success will report the snapshot generation time.  Acceptance Criteria: PTE reports the time to generate a snapshot when the snapshot generation was successful.  ></description> </Issue>

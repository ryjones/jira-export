CDATA This bug is to address the fact that only one pteReport.txt file is saved per test job. In the k8s test jobs, we run 3 test suites, using 3 network-spec files. Some of the tests are run in each network. The pteReport.txt file does not contain the network name, so that means the pteReport.txt file saved is only for the last test suite that includes it. The others are overwritten. We should name the files uniquely, or put all the logfiles for each test suite in separate directory, everytime we run a testsuite i.e. with a different network-spec.  Screenshot is attached with list of files generated after a test suite was executed. Observe that there is not a pteReport.txt file for all the tests, as there should be.  (Note: A test suite that runs a test twice within a single test suite using a single network-spec will only save one pteReport.txt file (and other log files) for one of them. That is a different bug.)  ></description> </Issue>

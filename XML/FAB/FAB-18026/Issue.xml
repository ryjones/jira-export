CDATA Hi, I'm seeing an issue with the Fabric 2.0 - 2.1 discovery service, in that, when an individual peer is stopped/started, the chaincodes installed/instantiated on a channel are forgotten and don't appear in the Chaincodes list. Checking on the peer itself, the chaincode is both installed, and instantiated when it comes back up, and I can invoke the chaincode normally. i.e. it works normally.  I've tested it with release-2.0.0 and tag v2.1.1  Is there a way to re-discover the instantiated chaincodes?  ></description> </Issue>

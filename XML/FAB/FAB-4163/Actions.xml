CDATA Retested and verified that this no longer generates a seg fault. The error message is now: {code:java} 2017-06-04 15:11:04.211 UTC  common/configtx/tool  main -> CRIT 009 Error on outputBlock: config does not contain an Orderers section, necessary for all config blocks, aborting{code} In this scenario, the config does in fact contain an Orderers section, but the profile selected does not, so the error is slightly misleading. A better error message would probably be "config for the selected profile does not contain an Orderers section, necessary for all orderer config blocks, aborting"  I personally view this as a nit, but I wanted to note it nonetheless.  ></body> </Action>

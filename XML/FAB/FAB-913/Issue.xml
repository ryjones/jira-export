CDATA https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-845 took a first pass into getting new protos structures into fabric and incorporating them in code path. There needs to be another level of consolidation with atomic broadcast protos so we can support config flows in addition to endorser flows.  In addition the consolidation also forces beneficial protos abstraction so both flows (and possibly others in future) can be treated generically.     ></description> </Issue>

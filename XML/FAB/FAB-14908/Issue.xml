CDATA Allow java chaincode javaenv and node chaincode baseimage to be at different version level than Fabric, by changing the javaenv and baseimage versions to 'latest' in core.yaml instead of specifying the Fabric version.  This will allow Fabric to work with different versions of chaincodes.  For example with this change Fabric v1.4.1-rc1 and v1.4.1 could work with javaenv v1.4.0. Similarly Fabric v1.4.1 could work with a newer javaenv or baseimage if there was a newer java or Node.js fixpack that was needed.  The only downside is that if a user forgets to pull the latest version of javaenv or baseimage, they could be using older versions without knowing it, and these older versions at some point may become incompatible.  Note that because the javaenv and baseimage version is defined in core.yaml, it can still be overridden with environment variables to specify an exact version.  Similar updates were made for v2.0 in FAB-11096: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27491/33/sampleconfig/core.yaml  ></description> </Issue>

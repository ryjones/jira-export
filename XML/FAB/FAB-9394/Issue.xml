CDATA Fabric-Release 1.0.6  Hyperledger Fabric Peer Docker Image can be run as a non-root user. However the chaincode container created by non-root running peer container is with root privileges.  This is logged as a security finding: {code:java} Typically, the user ID of a process running within a Docker container is the same as if it were outside the container. Should one of these processes be able to break out of the container onto the host, it would be running as the root user and would have complete control over the host.{code}  ></description> </Issue>

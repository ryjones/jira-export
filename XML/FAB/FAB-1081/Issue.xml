CDATA From a discussion with  ~muralisr . We wanted to document this here. Depending on further discussion, this task might get moved elsewhere.  Users need an editor to create/modify policies.  We do not want them to have to write a go program to generate protobufs and call the cauthdsl policy manager.  This editor can be GUI driven or CLI as long as it can guide a user through the steps needed. The output should be a blob that can be imported into hyperledger fabric.  ></description> </Issue>

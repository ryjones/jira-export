CDATA The peer CLI has always had a serious shortcoming, in that it can only collect an endorsement from a single peer when submitting a transaction.  This is a serious problem for doing any sort of meaningful testing or examples with the CLI, as an endorsement policy of "1 out of ..." is really not a good example for a system with distributed trust.  Because chaincode lifecycle will require by default endorsements from a 'majority' of organizations, for all but single-organization networks, deploying a chaincode will require obtaining a signature from at least two peers.  The design of this feature's implementation is deliberately left as an open question, to be decided with a design sub-task.  ></description> </Issue>

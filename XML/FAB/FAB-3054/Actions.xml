CDATA  ~markparz  I was not planning on listing everything. That's what the changelog is about. Known issues would be for any known significant gotchas that warrant more visibility than just sitting in JIRA. I would think that something like the absence of Java CC might warrant addition here since many were expecting it.     e.g.  Java chaincode support is disabled. It can be enabled with a code change and rebuild. We made this difficult by design to minimize any use with this release because it has not been tested and the community isn't in a position to effectively support it in its current state.  ></body> </Action>

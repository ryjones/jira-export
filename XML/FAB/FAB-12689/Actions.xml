CDATA Doesn't seem like pkcs11 tests should be running on platforms that don't have a pkcs11 library available.  Inside of github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/pkcs11/impl.go, it looks for /usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so on the mac. That version is way ancient.  Given the mac is one of the primary dev platforms, doesn't seem this should be failing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA softhsm was part of testenv image, as the image has been removed from fabric master, now the developer has to install softhsm package on his developement machine. I think we have to add these steps in fabric makefile to get it install in the dev platforms..  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.3/images/testenv/install-softhsm2.sh   Â   ></body> </Action>

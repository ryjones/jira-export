CDATA when a peer requests private data from a fellow peer, the fellow peer returns data by querying the transient store.  However - now when we're going to purge the data from the transient store upon commit, we need also to add support for obtaining the data from the private store in the ledger.  The dataRetriever object implemented in gossip_service needs a reference to the committer and it would call *GetPvtDataAndBlockByNum*    ~denyeart   ~manish-sethi   Maybe there is a more efficient way to just obtain the private data without the entire block?  Or - alternatively, just obtain the private data, that we need instead of all of the private data associated with a block?    ~C0rWin  FYI    ></description> </Issue>

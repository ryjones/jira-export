CDATA I reported the same broken doc links as FAB-11042 (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11042). The CR is also posted here. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24027/ The CR was merged to Fabricâ€™s release1.2 branch (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24059/). However, the CR has not been merged to master branch yet. I will post a comment to ask merging them to master branch. My CR was written for fabric repository. Please submit a CR for ci-management repository.   ></body> </Action>

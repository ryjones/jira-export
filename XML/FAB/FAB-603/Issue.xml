CDATA If the backlog limit is exceeded, discard all messages with Seq before the replica's hello message (we can, because we can play forward to this batch via state transfer).  If there is no hello message, we must be really slow or the replica must be byzantine.  In this case we probably should re-establish the connection.  After the connection has been re-established, we will receive a hello, and the following messages will trigger the pruning of old messages.  If this pruning lead us not to make progress, the backlog processing algorithm as lined out below will take care of starting a state transfer, using the hello message we received on reconnect.   ></description> </Issue>

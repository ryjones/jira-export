CDATA While separating config methods intended for test from the production config package, I found that this example was using the dev related config functions.  I can find no documentation (comments, README, or on the web) about this "example" other than some old issues in JIRA; the example didn't even compile as of 16 Mar 2018.  If there's value to this as an example, it needs some documentation and test. Short of that, the code should be removed or extracted to a more appropriate location - perhaps in fabric test as it seems to have originated from some work to enable concurrent execution of chaincode.   ~muralisr  - your thoughts?  ></description> </Issue>

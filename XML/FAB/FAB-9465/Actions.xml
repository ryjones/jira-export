CDATA  ~sykesm  "go build" worked on latest. Perhaps someone fixed it while fixing a dependency.   The sample does two things : provides a way to run stress tests on your chaincode and validate results of the execution by comparing with expected value.  As mentioned in  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1512 theres a CR that makes this more robust https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3623/ but have -1ed it for adding docs.  I think its got value but agree it doesn't really belong in "examples". I'll have saved off the project so I can submit a fully functional CCChecker when I get cycles.  We can use this JIRA to delete cchecker from examples if you like (I have abandoned https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3623/).   ></body> </Action>

Perhaps someone fixed it while fixing a dependency.  We addressed it as part of FAB-8923 while reducing the exclusion list in our unit test script.  >  We can use this JIRA to delete cchecker from examples if you like  I think I'm going to do that. The history is in git and JIRA and we can restore if needed. I've found that much of what we had under examples really aren't user consumable examples and believe that leads to confusion.

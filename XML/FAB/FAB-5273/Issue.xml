CDATA The {{broadcast_timestamp}}Â sample client is a good way to exercise only the {{Broadcast}} path without involving any of the other components of the fabric.  However, it was developed before MSP support had been integrated into the orderer.  Further, a single client submitting on a single stream is not a realistic stress test of the orderer, so adding multiple go routines to submit would make this stressing far more realistic.  ></description> </Issue>

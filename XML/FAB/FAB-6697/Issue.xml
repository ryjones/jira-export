CDATA The node chaincode tests are failing in the fabric-test smoke repository. As a result, no commits are passing the some tests that will allow for merging into the repo.  The issue that needs to be addressed in order for these tests to start passing again is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6689.  Once this issue is fixed, the tests may be enabled again.  Ideally, these smoke tests will also be executed when committing code in the fabric-repo as well.  ></description> </Issue>

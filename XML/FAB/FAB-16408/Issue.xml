CDATA We need to announce deprecation of the Kafka-based orderer given Raft provides the equivalent trust model, has additional features and is easier to manage and operate. Fabric 1.4.2+ has the ability to migrate from Kafka to Raft.  Personally, I'd like to actually remove Kafka support in Fabric 2.0.0 but if not, we should announce and then remove in a 2.x version.  ></description> </Issue>

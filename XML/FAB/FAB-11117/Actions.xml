CDATA Hi  ~sang ,  In regard to the original question the kafka, zookeeper, couchdb are inside fabric-baseimage/images folder. When you issue a make kafka command from the fabric-baseimage folder the image will be made for you. Same goes for zookeeper and couchdb. The easiest solution is really just to issue a make all command from the fabric-baseimage folder.   Yes, there are no official images availbale for aarch64. What you can do is use the images I have built (Using 64-bit Debian Stretch). You can find them on my Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/pesicsasa/. You have all the images you need built here for Hyperledger Fabric, and also a couchdb image.   Regarding the building process, I have also gone through some troubles with the previous version. I have built the new 1.2 images without any major issues.   Greets, SP  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~SashaPESIC , could you share how did you get to build those images? I'm on the same task, I'm using your images actually, but I need to compile tag 1.4.0, and yours are older than that.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello  ~diestrin ,   Lastly I worked with  ~ZakiAlam  to build these images ( https://hub.docker.com/u/zakialam ), and those are for HF version 1.4.1. However, i do have noted the steps needed to build the images. Note that this was last tested on HF 1.1 on my side, so these commands might need modification, but the process is the same. I attached the steps in this file ( ^steps.txt   If you have any further problems and need help do not hesitate to write on this post. I will help as much as I can. Meanwhile try running the images from  ~ZakiAlam .  Greets,  SP  ></body> </Action>

Let's skip the commit hash. If it turns out we want it, we can add it. 2. The gauge value is always 1 and is observed before returning the provider back to the caller. 3. It would be nice if the operations server configuration simply took a version string; the operations package would then declare the gauge options and populate the version label from what was provided and the go version from the runtime package. The operations package should not in any way depend on the metadata package.  Also, if this is being actively worked, please accept it.  ></body> </Action>

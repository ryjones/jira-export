CDATA `ChainSupport` interface in `chainsupport.go` is an union of `deliver.support`, `broadcast.support` and `ConsenterSupport`. Commit 16e170 introduced `SharedConfig` into `deliver.support`, which conflicts with that in `ConsenterSupport`. This is not supported by Golang due to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6977.  However, `SharedConfig` was removed in commit 6c28c8, which makes a clean union viable again. Therefore, `ChainSupport` should be cleaned up.  ></description> </Issue>

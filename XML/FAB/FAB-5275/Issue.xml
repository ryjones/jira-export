CDATA I copied the individual source snippets as I went through the  chaincode4ade.html|http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html  file.  At the end of the document, it says that we must add a main; however, it does not say anything about adding the type for SimpleAsset. Thus, it resulted in the following when I did a build:  {{$ go build --tags nopkcs11}}{{# simple-asset-chaincode}}{{./sacc.go:11: undefined: SimpleAsset}}{{./sacc.go:61:  }}{{undefined: SimpleAsset}}{{./sacc.go:82:  undefined: SimpleAsset}}  This is easy to fix, as the full source snippet has the information necessary; however, it would be nice to call out this requirement in one of the steps.  ></description> </Issue>

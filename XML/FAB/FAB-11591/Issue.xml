CDATA Acceptance criteria:  # User edits {{configtx.yaml}} so as to have a network with a single-node etcd/raft-based ordering service and a system channel that is also an application channel. Assume {{BatchSize}} is set to 1. # User launches single-node etcd/raft-based ordering service. # User invokes the Broadcast RPC to submit a channel creation request (for, say. channel {{foo}}). User immediately receives a SUCCESS response. # User invokes the Deliver RPC on channel {{foo}} and receives its genesis block. # User restarts the OSN and repeats the previous step with the same result.  ></description> </Issue>

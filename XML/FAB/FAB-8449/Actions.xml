CDATA I would strongly advise that you use a specific release... it is likely that you may hit a transient issue when running against master/latest.     I just tested against v1.1.0-alpha, and it works correctly. Please use this version of the docs to install prerequisites, etc and run the sample. You will want to re-install the fabric-samples and perform the install of binaries again per the v1.1.0-alpha docs.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Doc change here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7469  Document the following enhancement:  Once this code is published it will be possible to identify MSP administrators by using the Organizational Units they belong to without have to name them explicitly. Therefore, we need to document the how the MSP configuration can be used to specify an OU that identifies the administrators of that MSP. Namely, we propose to add the following new protobuf message: {code:java} message FabricAdminOUs { // If true then an administrators are identities by their OUs, otherwise they need // to be named one by one. bool   Enable = 1;  // OU Identifier of the clients FabricOUIdentifier adminOUIdentifier = 2; {code} to FabricMSPConfig. At setup time, if FabricAdminOUs.Enable is equal True then the MSP will enforce only identities carries the specified OU will be considered administrators of that MSP, otherwise, the previous behavior is enforced.

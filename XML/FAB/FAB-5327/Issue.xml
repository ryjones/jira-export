CDATA In the implementation of FAB-5325, when testing against Kafka, we need to manually start a kafka service at localhost:9092. Ideally we could automate this process in the code as part of test environment setup, i.e. start a kafka docker container for each test run.  To prevent each test run from reloading previous config in system chain, we use randomly generated system chain name every time, `system-chain-XXXXX`, as a workaround. Using ephemeral container could eliminate this as well.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We were alerted to a PSIRT  for our solution built on top of Fabric, based on  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7692   ,|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7692,  for vulnerable versions of the google-oauth-client (any before 1.31) It took us a while to figure out where Fabric had a copy, it is at least contained in the hyperledger/fabric-javaenv:2.2.0 Docker image, though it may be in other places.   Run the following command to see the dependency in the image: {code:java} docker run -it hyperledger/fabric-javaenv:2.2.0 bash -c 'find / -name "*google*"'{code} These dependencies should be updated to versions not affected by this PSIRT.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA FAB-17303  defaulted private data dissemination policies requiredPeerCount=0 and maxPeerCount=1 for implicit org-specific private data collections. However depending on number of peers your org has, and the amount of redundancy you desire for storing private data, you may want your peer to override these defaults with values in peer's core.yaml, for example:  {code:java} peer.gossip.pvtData.ImplicitCollectionDisseminationPolicy.requiredPeerCount peer.gossip.pvtData.ImplicitCollectionDisseminationPolicy.maxPeerCount {code}  The override will apply to all channels the peer has joined. The implication is that requiredPeerCount has to be smaller than the number of peers in a channel that has the lowest numbers of peers from the org (this should be mentioned in the doc and/or core.yaml comments).  Acceptance criteria:  If requiredPeerCount or maxPeerCount are specified locally in core.yaml, when peer endorses a proposal that writes to its OWN implicit collection,  these values override the default values of 0 and 1 for disseminating private data.  Note that FAB-17491 will ensure that peer does not disseminate private data targeted for OTHER organization's implicit collections.   ></description> </Issue>

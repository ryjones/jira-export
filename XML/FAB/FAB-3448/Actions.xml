CDATA Clayton, following an earlier suggestion from  ~ChristopherFerris  I try to assign myself to only 1-2 items at a time -- the ones that I'm currently working on.  I ask folks to assign stuff to me so that I get the notification email and categorize the JIRA appropriately if need be, and then unassign myself on purpose, per the logic above.  As long as the item is under the "fabric-consensus" component with a fix for "v1.0.0" I will tackle it, if nobody else does so in the meantime. But assigning myself to all relevant items in advance seems like the wrong strategy. Let me know if you disagree.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This has been addressed via https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3727 /  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9111/  .  Essentially, the orderer was incorrectly identifying non-system channels as system channels, so, when the orderer was started with an old broken config, it incorrectly believed that the config was valid and started anyway.  This invalid config results in the runtime crash you see here.  ></body> </Action>

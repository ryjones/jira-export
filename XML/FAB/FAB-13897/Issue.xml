CDATA GetState("") against CouchDB will attempt to query the database, but since the key is an empty string, that portion of the REST URL will go missing and CouchDB will interpret it to be a query against the key's database itself.  You end up getting a confusing error: {code:java} Failed to handle GET_STATE. error: no revision tag detected{code} Since empty string is not allowed in CouchDB (its already validated against in PutState), the GetState() request should simply return an error immediately with a good error message, rather than allow the query to go all the way to CouchDB.  ></description> </Issue>

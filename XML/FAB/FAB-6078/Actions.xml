CDATA  ~mastersingh24 , it is true that you can run crypto-gen again with another file which contains brand new orgs and their peers and orderers, the issue is after you generate a set of certs (say using crypto-config1.yml), then you set up your network using that set of certs, you run your network for a month or so, then you have new orgs want to join, when you create a new set of the certs, these certs have nothing to do with the orignal set of the certs, how will the new orgs joining in the existing network. I think that is really the issue, it is not that crypto-gen can not create a new set of certs. The current crypto-gen create self-signed root ca certs, they are not intermediate root ca certs. I have tried to run the tool and also studied the tool, I am pretty sure that it does not use a real root ca to create intermediate cas for each org. Thanks.  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA In addition to the tests included in the k8s system test suite and NL+PTE Daily test suite, identify and execute other system tests, pulling from our pte test library and experiences in previous releases.  Revise charts to show their status on v2.0 Release page ( https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=11700 ). And, improve that page: * remove the "Fabric-SVT-1.2-Must-Have" chart * keep SVT-New chart, to just show all 2.0 fixVersion items; we are creating new testtasks in v2.0 for most tests * initially, keep SVT-Regression chart; after we create new testtasks in v2.0 for the items here that we want to keep and reuse, then we may change this chart filter to show only "release test" from past releases (so it will be empty for 2.0, but then could be used in future releases as a reference) * optionally create a similar SVT-Release chart for all those "release test" plus other SVT TestTasks that are not fixVersion=v2.0 * keep the SVT-Regression-ContinuousDelivery chart for NL+PTE and k8s systests     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Presently, MakeChainCreationTransaction is a function of the channelconfig package.  Although it does seem related to the channelconfig and references many of the constants defined there, it is actually unneeded during the runtime for either the orderer or peer binaries, and is only used by CLI and tests.  Therefore, it is a better fit in the configtxgen/encoder package.  This CR also renames this method to MakeChannelCreationTransaction and switches it to use the newer underlying config group generation introduced earlier in this series.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We currently inject the peer's TLS cert when we build the chaincode container.  This can lead to fragility, for example, when the peer updates its certificate.  We can improve this by switching to a model where we inject the TLS materlal JIT.    Ideal solution would probably be a volume/secrets mount.  However, given the peer's relationship to dockerd (often times accessing remotely) volume mounts can be a challenge.  A more reliable if but more awkward solution is to use the upload-api as part of the launch sequence.  ></description> </Issue>

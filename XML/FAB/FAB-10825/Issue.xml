CDATA Many of the assorted 'utils' functions actually reach into the core/chaincode/platforms package to determine whether packages are valid.  This historically has all been done in a source-coupled way, pulling peer details into places it does not belong.  Although these 'util' functions should be refactored and removed, for the time being, we can at least make the dependency on the platforms package explicit, but requiring that an instance be passed into these util functions.  ></description> </Issue>

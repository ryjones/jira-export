CDATA This is the error I got when I tried to start from ground zero after a clean git clone  $ vagrant up Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider... ==> default: Box 'hyperledger/fabric-baseimage' could not be found. Attempting to find and install... default: Box Provider: virtualbox default: Box Version: 0.0.11 ==> default: Loading metadata for box 'hyperledger/fabric-baseimage' default: URL: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage ==> default: Adding box 'hyperledger/fabric-baseimage' (v0.0.11) for provider: virtualbox default: Downloading: {color:#d04437}https://atlas.hashicorp.com/hyperledger/boxes/fabric-baseimage/versions/0.0.11/providers/virtualbox.box{color} An error occurred while downloading the remote file. The error message, if any, is reproduced below. Please fix this error and try again.  Couldn't resolve host '{color:#d04437}binstore-test.hashicorp.com{color}'  First of all, I thought the image is to be downloaded from "atlas.hashicorp.com" why does "binstore-test.hashicorp.com" has anything to do with it?  Then I tried to test the network connectivity with port 443 given the protocol is https $ telnet binstore-test.hashicorp.com 443 Trying 52.4.205.238... Connected to prod-binstore-914876835.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. Escape character is '^ '. ^  telnet> quit Connection closed.  The connectivity seems OK, so I don't know why it gives me "Couldn't resolve host 'binstore-test.hashicorp.com'"  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Once the valid pvtData has been constructed at the kvledger, we need to pass the valid pvtData to the stateDB txmgr for further checks and commit.Â  * The txmgr needs to check for any stale pvtData (by comparing the version and hash of passed pvtData against the committed hashedKey version and hashedValue) and remove any such stale data. * Once all stale data has been removed, txmgr needs to create the update batch (for committing the data to the stateDB)  ></description> </Issue>

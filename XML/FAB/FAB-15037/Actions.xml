CDATA The confusion here is the term 'block file'.  {{configtxlator}} can decode Fabric blocks, which are binary proto-encoded, to JSON.  These Fabric blocks may be retrieved using CLI utilities like {{peer channel fetch}}, or can be retrieved via the SDKs.  What you are attempting to do is to decode the 'blockfile' off of the filesystem of a peer or orderer.  This is also a binary encoding, which embeds the proto-encoded blocks, but is not meant to be consumed directly outside of the peer or orderer binaries themselves.  {{configtxlator}} is not designed to read these blockfiles, only the blocks themselves.  ></body> </Action>

If you wish to have a tool capable of inspecting the &apos;blockfiles&apos; in the ledger directory, this would be a new feature request, not a bug." created="2020-04-23 15:04:17.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2020-04-23 15:04:17.0"/>

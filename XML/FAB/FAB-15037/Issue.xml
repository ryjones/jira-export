CDATA  https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/message/5816    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51219466/how-can-i-read-the-blcokfile-xxxx   copying email from Jason: {quote}Although configtxlator's primary purpose is to translate config blocks, assuming you're using a recent build, it should also be able to decode standard blocks as well.  If you have a standard block which cannot be decoded with the latest version, please feel free to open a bug in JIRA, including the block, as this function is expected to work.  Please include how you got the block.  Commonly, CLI utilities will include extraneous data like newlines in the output which can confuse the proto decoding.  Thanks, ~Jason {quote} we have tried using the most recent (1.4.0) build of configtxlator  ></description> </Issue>

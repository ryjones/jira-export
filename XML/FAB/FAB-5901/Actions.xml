CDATA  ~hazim-j  Not sure if you are still having issues.  You might want to try the following:  1) Use Git Bash (I think you are using Cygwin?) 2) Pull down the latest version of fabric-samples and also install the  latest binaries|http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html#download-platform-specific-binaries   We'll leave this open for a couple of days, but after that we'll close this as using the prereqs with the latest samples and binaries works fine on Windows 10  ></body> </Action>

CDATA By running the *byfn.sh*, all the required environment variables such as FABRIC_CFG_PATH is set within the script.  What was preventing the proper running of the script seems like due to different version of sed.  By using git bash instead of cygwin bash did not have any issues.  The difference there is the version of sed.  sed versions:  git sed: 5.4.2  cygwin sed: 4.4  ></body> </Action>

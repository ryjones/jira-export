CDATA An application can deploy a chaincode to a Peer by sending a Proposal to a Peer to deploy a chaincode. In particular, this Proposal is targetted at a special *system chaincode* called *Life Cycle Chaincode*. The life cycle chaincode manages all chaincodes deployed to a peer.  {quote}Fig 1provides a overview of the process as far as the interactions between the application and the Endorser goes.  The process's loop is completed when the transaction related to the proposal is fed back to the Committer (Endorser is also a committer) as shown in Fig 2 (LCCC_VSCC in the figure is the Validation System Chaincode for Lifcycle Chaincode) {quote}{quote}  !BasicDeployFlow.png|thumbnail!  *Fig 1*  !BasicDeployCommitFlow.png|thumbnail!  *Fig 2*  ></description> </Issue>

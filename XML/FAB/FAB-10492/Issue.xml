CDATA It is observed that on install chain code failure, PTE does not abort..instead it continues to instantiate chaincode steps etc. If install itself has failed, PTE should abort. In general, it will be good to have error handling implemented to abort test on critical failures such as install failure.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

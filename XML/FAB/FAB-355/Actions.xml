CDATA Hi Chris,  These changesets refer to this JIRA item, but they do not satisfy it completely. There are still some functions (related to encryption decryption) that have not been implemented. Also these changesets refer to branch 0.6. Not sure I should create a new JIRA item for the master, since this part of the code would be the same for both branches. Let me know which option would confuse contributors/reviewers the least... Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

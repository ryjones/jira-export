CDATA Our make process is essentially a number of phony targets used to generate a handful of artifacts. Further, the go toolchain already understands what packages/files should cause packages to be recompiled and binaries relinked.  When putting the two together, it doesn't make much sense for the make process to define recipes that rely on all of the go files in the project.  To simplify things and remove any assumption that we have dependency based builds, drop PROJECT_FILES from the make process.  ></description> </Issue>

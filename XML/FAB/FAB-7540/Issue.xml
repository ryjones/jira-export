CDATA The new tutorial on how to reconfigure your first network is a great addition because it fills in an important gap by answering the typical question people ask once they are done with the BYFN tutorial. However, following the new tutorial is strikingly more complex than following the BYFN tutorial. While this can be explained by the fact the process involved is indeed more complex it is also because very little help beside the documentation is provided.  We can make following the tutorial much easier by providing a script or set of scripts similar to the byfn.sh that people can use while following the tutorial and as a starting point for addressing their own specific use case.  ></description> </Issue>

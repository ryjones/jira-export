CDATA   Validation fails when you add a MSP along with consenters in a single config update. I receive  {code} consensus metadata update for channel config update is invalid: verifying tls client cert with serial number 202563322038103064295345433482878287045550471240: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority {code}. This certificate is singed by msp that is being added in this transaction.  The right way would be to compute a simulated configuration and take the root CAs from it.  ></description> </Issue>

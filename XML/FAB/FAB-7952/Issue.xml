CDATA The following error is received for different reasons: {code} Failed to deserialize creator identity, err MSP org1.example.com is unknown{code}  For example, when attempting to query on a channel that doesn't exist or a peer has not successfully joined an existing channel - this error is generated.  The error messages either should be clarified as to what the actual error is or documented as to what areas to look at during a debugging process. At the very least, if the desire is to be vague, a more generic message such as "Unable to communicate on the channel" should be used instead. I would still highly recommend documenting what areas to look at when receiving this message.   ></description> </Issue>

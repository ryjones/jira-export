CDATA h2. Steps to Reproduce:  Set up a network with 3 raft based orderers, such as the one defined in FAB-13604. Enable all logs in the orderers at DEBUG level. ('DEBUG level' is open for discussion, but certainly we expect to see no kafka logs at INFO level.) h2. Observed:  Observe logs about kafka. See attachment `kafka_logs_in_raft_orderer.txt`  which shows the kafka logs from the raft orderers of a raft network. {quote}$ grep -i kafka snapshot*scenario2.log > kafka_logs_in_raft_orderer.txt {quote} For the full logs from the orderers used in this test, refer to attachments on FAB-13604: * snapshot-OSN1-FAB-13604-scenario2.log * snapshot-OSN2new-FAB-13604-scenario2.log * snapshot-OSN3-FAB-13604-scenario2.log  h2. Expected:  We expect to see no logs about kafka in a raft orderer. We might accept some exceptions for only some DEBUG logs that display ALL environment variables (which should show kafka being disabled or show the default settings of some kafka controls).     ></description> </Issue>

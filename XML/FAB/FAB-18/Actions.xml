CDATA This is being moved over from the old github repo.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/1077 (Issue 1077)  @bksmith (Keith Smith) mentioned the following: The way in which cloud foundry handles this is that each object in the system has 3 things: 1) name, 2) type, and 3) guid. The name and type are of course provided by the object creator and the guid is generated like a hash. At any point in time, the combination must be unique, while guids are globally unique across time. So if an object with name=foo and type=bar is created, deleted, and recreated, it's 2nd instance will have a different guid even if the contents are identical. Objects can be retrieved by name & type ... or by guid. This design has worked well for cloud foundry / bluemix as it enables someone to reference a specific object in time by using it's guid as well as referencing it by name in case it is deleted and recreated, or simply updated.  I will be closing issue 1077  ></body> </Action>

To do duplication check, alias name can be saved to DB, and a chaincode sub command (eg. peer chaincode list)  to show all chaincodes in the ledger,  this command can be used by chaincode deployer to choose a new alias name.

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris  We have fixed this and users are now used to providing name when installing, instantiating and invoking chaincode.  Is "Done" more appropriate than "WONTFIX" ...or we can consider "WONTFIX" as an alternative to FIXED-ELSEWHERE.  But either works for me.  ></body> </Action>

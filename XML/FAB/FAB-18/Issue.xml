CDATA STORY: Developer wants to be able to name their chaincode to something meaningful and easy to read so that she can speed up development, debugging, upgrading and be less error prone by eliminating copy/paste required.  Human readable CC address alias  Description  What we have today is a low level unique identifier for chaincode, which is generated and returned by the fabric automatically(i.e. a hash string). This is impossible to read. It would be much better if the hash string can be mapped to a human readable alias. I'd venture to say most developers do a copy/paste currently to refer to the chaincode during development, which can be error prone.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Create Azure pipeline templates (Includes dependency package installation yaml file) keeping only PTE, LTE and Operator (our first ginkgo based tests using new launcher and other tools). Initially, we will include PTE and LTE tests as part of smoke test verification, and add Operator tests as soon as they are ready via FAB-16529.  Once the ginkgo based framework is ready, we will replace the existing python wrappers with ginkgo test drivers to run the tests and generate xml. (Refer to epicÂ FAB-16160).  Behave tests are out of scope from fabric-test CR verification POV.  ></description> </Issue>

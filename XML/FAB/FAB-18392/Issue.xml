CDATA Other than stating that it should not be used for production networks, the test network documentation does not go in to much detail about its scope and limitations...    https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html      For example, a recent stack overflow question asked why {{_./network.sh deployCC_ d}}id not work when trying to deploy chaincode on a channel with a single org. I did not think it was obvious from the current documentation that the current scripts would not support this sort of experimentation. Should they? Or should there be more explicit guidance on what the next steps should be.  I know there have been discussions about the scope of the test network, e.g. in relation to other alternatives, however I couldn't find anything specific in Jira/elsewhere.   ></description> </Issue>

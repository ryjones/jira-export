CDATA If you use v1.3.0 version of fabric-samples, basic-network's script uses latest version, currently v1.4.0.  In basic-network sample, it uses lastest version of fabric docker images, which is currently 1.4.0.     In addition to that, other samples such as fabcar uses basic-network sample.  You can aslo see the warning of v1.4.0 new logging feature, CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL, when you run ./fabcar/startFabric.sh.     ></description> </Issue>

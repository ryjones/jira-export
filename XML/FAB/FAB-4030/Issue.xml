CDATA I am working around to figure out that Fabric v0.6 is really not allowed data modification illegally. Beside I want to modify data in "sst" format directly. I want to use some other such as create instance of database then retrieve all data -> Modified them -> put them back and star the peer normally. but when I try to create instance of Rocksdb, I got this error  !Snip20170518_1.png! Based on this tutorial:  http://pyrocksdb.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4/tutorial/index.html   If it's a new database then it's fine. while it come to database of blockchain, I got this few error.      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently delivery client is created each time peer joins the channel, as a consequence peers opens new connection to the ordering service instead of re-using one which already opened.  Need to factor out the part of code which instantiate delivery client from the peer part into the gossip service, this especially makes sense in light of upcoming changes related to the gossip based per chain leader election.    ></description> </Issue>

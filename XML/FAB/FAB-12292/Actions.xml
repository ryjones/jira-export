<Action id="51733" issue="34409" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="There is a high priority story for this already - FAB-8053 , which is being considered for the next generation lifecycle.  I&apos;m marking this as a duplicate, I&apos;ve also referenced FAB-12292 in the text of FAB-8053 to ensure that the concern is not lost. It would likely be addressed by more dynamic endorsement policies such as any 1 channel org, any 2 orgs, majority of orgs, etc, which is being considered in FAB-8053. This way the endorsement policy would not have to change at all when channel membership changes." created="2018-10-04 05:09:02.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-10-04 05:09:02.0"/>

CDATA Test names should be descriptive. Since our test targets are now folders we should properly name them. For starters, we should change the name of `regression` to something like `system_test`.  The `system_test` directory should have categorized folders, i.e., `performance`, `load`, `chaos`...  Then `barebones` will reside in `performance` but we will change the name of `barebones` to be something more descriptive, like `simple_performance_regression` (just an example)        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This story is dedicated to the functionality of joining channels using the channel participation API.  If the orderer does not have a system channel defined, it should be able to join application channels.   If the orderer does have a system channel defined, it should not be able to join any other channels.   If the orderer does not have any channels defined, it should be able to join any channel, including the system channel.  The orderer should be able to join as a cluster member (included in the consenters set) or as a follower (not included in the consenters set). The orderer should allow a transition from a cluster follower to a cluster member and vise-versa.  ></description> </Issue>

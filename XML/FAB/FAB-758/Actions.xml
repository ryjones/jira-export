CDATA Hello, working on some ID / documentation tasks - specifically a glossary for v1.0 terms, at the moment.  In the posted HyperledgerFabric_LedgerV1_20161129.pptx file above, slide 3 - where is the *raw ledger* in the "v1 Transaction Lifecycle" diagram? -- The v1.0 architecture doc emphasizes 3 data structures - 1) raw ledger, 2) blockchain state, and 3) validated ledger. The arch. doc. describes "batches" of transactions being written to the raw ledger, which includes both "valid" and "invalid" transactions. Invalid transactions are eventually filtered out and written to the validated ledger as "blocks". The raw ledger remains as the record of all attempts to modify state, but can be "pruned" (edited) to remove invalid transactions. (See Sec. 4 at: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/proposals/r1/Next-Consensus-Architecture-Proposal.md)   So some questions to help clarify *slide 3* in the .pptx, as compared to the arch. 1.0 doc: 1) Can an endorsing peer and a committing peer be the same peer? 2) Are all endorsing peers also committing peers? (But not all committing peers are necessarily endorsing peers.) 3) Is the raw ledger on the endorsing peer(s) only. And the validated ledger on the committing peer(s) only? (Which in many cases is the same peer?) 4) The "Blockchain File System" under/on the endorsing peer, in the slide 3 diagram, is not connected to anything. Is that the raw ledger?  Thanks ... jh     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Today, chain creation requests are only validated based on the fact that they are well formed, and signed according to the policy for chain creation.  There is no checking to make sure that the orderers are specified correctly, that the orderer MSPs are included, etc.  What these checks are need to be determined as part of this story, as well as their implementation.  There is a plug point in the multichain systemChain.go code which is meant to handle this, but it currently is mostly a no-op.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA For now, for all our automation tests to be successful, NL and Operator-Launcher tools must both use the same name for the orderersystemchannel, so PTE (which runs with networks started with either of those launchers) can assume the correct name. PTE needs that information when creating a channel, to fetch genesis block from the system channel. With this task, we should add a line to the pte/test Input file to specify the name of the orderer system channel, and pass it to PTE from operator. That way, PTE could be used with any network created by our operator launcher.Â   The systemchannel name is needed only when creating a channel, so it is not needed by others who launch their own network and who want to use PTE to run traffic - as long as they create their own channels beforehand, without using PTE to do it.  One example of a network launched without using operator launcher is a network launched with NL, as is currently done in our CI tests. We can continue to use PTE with NL - but note that requires NL and PTE to use the same default name of the orderersystemchannel, since there is no way for NL to pass that information to PTE today.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Release Notes ------------- Fabric 1.4.0 introduces a new programming model designed to improve developer productivity and ease of use. A new NPM package `fabric-contract-api` is added that lets the developer focus on the functions they want to invoke within the chaincode. They can also modularize their applications into 'Contracts' by extending a Contract class.  See https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/developapps/developing_applications.html  To help client applications, and tooling and to make working with the transaction functions easier, a defined schema of Contract Metadata has been introduced. Depending on language a large part of this can be automatically created. Typescript Annotations are provided that are very useful in creating this data.  See https://fabric-shim.github.io/contract-schema.json   On the client application side, a new NPM package `fabric-network` is added which contains the classes and methods for writing blockchain enabled applications in node.js using javascript or typescript.  See https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/module-fabric-network.html  ></body> </Action>

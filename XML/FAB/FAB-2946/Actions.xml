CDATA Hi  ~troyronda , (hope you had a good weekend, etc., etc.). Not a lot to update actually, have just posted a related not on FAB-2945 - I don't think that upgrading to Golang 1.8 is a "NOOP", we will need to re-test a lot of things.  IMHO, I'd rather push for fixing the known issues we have now, and work "full steam" to release the *1.0.0-rc1* in a few days, instead of spending cycles on this update. While I opened this in March, I have just marked it as *v1.1.* That said, I/we can be convinced otherwise (and bring it up for discussion/vote etc.): Any upside(s) in upgrading to Golang 1.8 (*1.8.3* if any, btw) at this point?  ></body> </Action>

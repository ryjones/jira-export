CDATA This story is to add a non-e2e style integration test connecting the proposal generation, proposal validation, proposal response generation, proposal response validation, tx generation, and tx validation components of Fabric.  This used to exist in v1.4.x as {{core/common/validation/fullflow_test.go}} but was poorly written and relied on singletons, so was dismantled.  ></description> </Issue>

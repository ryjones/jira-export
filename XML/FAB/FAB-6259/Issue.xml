CDATA For orderer system channel, messages of type other than CONFIG or CONFIG_UPDATE are useless, and should be discarded instead of  being cut into block.  However, this is trickier than it sounds. we cannot do it in {{consenter}}, because it simply does not have knowledge to tell if it's system channel or not. So we need to do that at the entrance of broadcast, which means filtering EVERY ingress message. This is the overhead we want to avoid.  So, this story just documents this potential improvement, but not necessarily needs to be addressed due to reasons aforementioned.  ></description> </Issue>

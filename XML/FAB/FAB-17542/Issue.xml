CDATA *TIMEBOXED* - 3 hours  We are all familiar with the 20 minute timeout flake that happens in the orderer. Those most familiar with that code have not fixed it since it started happening last summer. (Complexity has a cost.)  The task is to audit the code and attempt to do one of two things:  1. Fix the problem 2. Add a mitigation that will not allow tests to run longer than 3-5 minutes before failing.  From a very quick scan of the stacks, it seems like {{orderer/common/cluster/deliver_test.go:184}} is in most (all?) of the stacks. Perhaps this receive should be dropped into a select against a timer of 2 or 3 minutes...  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the SDK needs to know beforehand the endpoints of the endorsers it uses in its chaincode invocation.  Additionally, it needs to know beforehand that the required chaincode has been installed on the peers.  On top of that, if the peers that the SDK interacts with fail or become unreachable - it cannot use Fabric at all.  The  following proposal|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zP04PKay4FN0tKYjHUSanyfK9b94rtYvC9MDSKGeSSE/edit  describes a service discovery capability that if introduced to Hyperledger Fabric - would remove the above restrictions.   Below is a document on how the SDKs should implement the client side support for the application.      ^Consuming the discovery service by the SDK.pdf      ></description> </Issue>

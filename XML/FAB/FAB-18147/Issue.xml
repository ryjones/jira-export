CDATA Following the discussion in this  pull request|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1693 , this task is dedicated to the refactoring of theÂ multichannel.ChainSupport and its constituents, especially the embedded components that provide functionality around channel-config and ledger access.  See these comments for more details: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1693#issuecomment-671987198 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1693#issuecomment-672050466 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1693#issuecomment-672640721 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1693#issuecomment-672649655  The goal is to allow the follower, the chain, and possibly cluster to have access to objects that provide the functionality of channel-config & ledger access trough a well defined set of independent objects, rather than the monolith "ChainSupport".   As a first step, we'll expose and isolate some of the constituents of "ChainSupport", but keep the functionality of "ChainSupport" itself as is. This is mainly to avoid too many changes at the same time, particularly at the  etcdraft.Chain that uses it.   In a second step we'll look at improving the way the  follower.Chain makes use of the individual components the emerged out of "ChainSupport", especially the channel-config.  In a third step we'll look at improving the way the  etcdraft.Chain makes use of the individual components of "ChainSupport".   ></description> </Issue>

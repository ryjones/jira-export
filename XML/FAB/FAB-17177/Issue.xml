CDATA The cluster replication verifies blocks by pulling them in batches, and performs hash chain verification + verifies the signatures of the last block in the chain.  It uses the bundle stored in the global config structures, but in case it comes across a config block in the middle of the batch, it switches to use a bundle constructed from that config block.  However, if the config block is the last block in the batch - it accidentally verifies it twice: once with the config block before it (as expected) and once with the config block itself (which is unexpected).        ></description> </Issue>

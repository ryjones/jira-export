CDATA Current peer ships with chaintool v1.0.1.   Chaintool v1.1.0 was just released with support for protobuf 'oneof' type.  We can make a low-risk update to the release-1.1 branch to include this new, useful, feature.  Note that the correlation between chaintool 1.1 and fabric 1.1 is coincidental.  ></description> </Issue>

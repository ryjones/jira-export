CDATA The Life Cycle System Chaincode (LCCC) maps unique chaincode names to other chaincode properies such as Version and deployment spec using chaincode state variables.  LCCC also provides a simple and powerful mechanism to manage names  * ledger state to manage the chaincode instead of getting it from a block in the blockchain (which is what 0.5 did) * check uniqueness of deployment using unique chaincode name  With these we no longer need to depend upon generated hash to provide uniqueness. We may still use hash to restrict duplicate deployments of the same code but using different names in a separate story.  *Also we will disallow some characters in chaincode name for use in future support for namespaces. Currently these characters are "/  {}$:"*  ></body> </Action>

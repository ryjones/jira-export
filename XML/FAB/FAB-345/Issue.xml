While its provides a good starting point with support for basic Get/Put/Delete state and Range operations, it does not have support for Table operations. As we add more chaincodes to the base fabric (such as Life Cycle System Chaincode) which use Tables, we need the mock chaincode unit test framework to support it." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2016-09-12 00:47:59.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:55:49.0" resolutiondate="2016-09-12 00:48:16.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="36202"/>

CDATA Currently, whenever we get a bad status from an OSN for a deliver call we disable the endpoint of the peer until a timeout expires.  The idea was to not waste time on selecting that endpoint, and select another one instead in the next time we re-connect to an OSN.  This is intrusive because we need APIs to disable the endpoint from the layer of the block delivery all the way to the layer that selects a new connection.   In reality, it doesn't add much, and we can accomplish an equivalent effect if we just permute the order of the OSNs, and keep a reference to the last OSN we were connected to.    ~jyellick   ~C0rWin    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Our GO obcsdk is used by a set of tests written in GO for consensus acceptance and regression, ledger stress tests, concurrency, and longrun testing. To talk to the Peers, client threads use REST calls. To leverage all these tests in v1.0 and beyond using node.js (especially needed if REST is deprecated), we must: # Decouple the REST functions from the GO application layer, and create a well-defined API. # Implement the node.js SDK communication interface methods, to perform the same functions as the existing REST functions. # Provide a test environment variable for the GO application tests to choose either REST or node.js.   ></description> </Issue>

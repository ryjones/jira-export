CDATA Some user information in membersrvc.yaml is duplicated because it is spread across the ECA and ACA sections.  This file would be simpler if there was a single user section that contains a combination of the data.  Also, it should not be in table format for each user because doing so requires putting values for all fields when some/many may be optional.  Each field should have also have more complete comments to describe it's use and refer to section of documentation for fuller descriptions.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Whenever an alive message reaches the  gossip layer|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go#L418-L421   from the communication layer|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go#L315 , its  signature is verified|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/gossip/gossip_impl.go#L1061  at the gossip layer before being dispatched  by the membership package|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/discovery/discovery_impl.go#L310 .   If an alive message has a logical timestamp that is lower or equal to a message that was received from the same node - it is verified and then discarded inside the membership package.   It is wasteful because when alive messages are gossiped, they might be received by the same peer several times, and instead we should immediately discard it and not waste CPU cycles on verifying it  ></description> </Issue>

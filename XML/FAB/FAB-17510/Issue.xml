CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to use a fit-for-purpose function that adds an org definition to a named consortium in system channel configuration. This result of this function should be a channel update transaction that can later be signed.  Â Acceptance  Calling the new function with appropriate arguments should generate a config update transaction that semantically matches one produced by the process that uses {{configtxgen}} {{-printOrg}}, {{protolator}}, and {{configtxgen}}.  This story is only concerned with adding the org to the consortium - not creating a channel.  Most of the manual steps are documented here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/channel_update_tutorial.html  ></description> </Issue>

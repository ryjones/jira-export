This is unexpected Endorsement Policy PASS if the endorsement policy was to require 2 endorsement response from 2 different members of Org1.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/cauthdsl/cauthdsl.go#L31 Each identity in identities   *mb.MSPPrincipal should be unique, but there's no check about this  ></description> </Issue>

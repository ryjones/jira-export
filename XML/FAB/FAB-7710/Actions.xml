CDATA  ~mastersingh24   ~yacovm  Shouldn't non-infrastructure SCCs be able to be supported without the determinism issues?  Should the approach end up being similar to UCC where there is ledger knowledge of the SCC (some mechanism like instantiate)?  (I'm asking as it would be good to not need go build tags to mitigate this issue and have the ability to include in "normal" builds).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA So, I agree that ideally one should not need to use a build tag in order to run a user chaincode inside the peer, AKA "system" chaincode. The problem, is that we use system chaincodes for stuff that we should not use system chaincodes for, like validation of transactions. In order for the masses not to shoot themselves in the foot by accident, we are lowering risk by simply disabling this option by default.   ></body> </Action>

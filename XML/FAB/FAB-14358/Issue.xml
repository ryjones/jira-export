CDATA Each of the command line tools that we ship in support of fabric should be moved to cmd/${tool name}.   Most of these exist in common/tools and should updated to have their main functions moved to cmd/${tool name}/main.go. The main should handle flag processing and then call supporting code as necessary. The main test (if present) should also be moved with the main.  The supporting code (other than the main) that lives in common/tools should be moved to internal/${tool name}. At some point, some of the code may move again but let's start there.  At first glance, this looks like configtxgen, cryptogen, and configtxlator.  ></description> </Issue>

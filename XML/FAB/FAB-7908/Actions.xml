CDATA The reason it was not working is :  1. Some fabric-ca images that base on fabric images, so make sure FABRIC_TAG environment variable is set to the latest tag of the fabric images that are on the machine where fabric-ca sample is being run     2. Fabric-ca code was changed to restrict custom attributes from starting with "hf." prefix. But fabric-ca-sample was using hf.admin custom attribute. Hence it was failing.      After fixing these two problems,  ~latitiah was able to run the fabric-ca sample with mutual auth successfully.  ></body> </Action>

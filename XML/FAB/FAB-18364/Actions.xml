CDATA *IMPORTANT*: I opened a few different {color:#FF0000}IdemixCredential{color} in the {color:#FF0000}IdemixMSPSignerConfig{color} and noticed the following pattern:     *When credentials are generated from IdemixGen for an ADMIN:* * IdemixMSPSignerConfig.role = 2 (*correct*) * AND * IdemixCredential.Attrs 1  = 2 (*correct)*  *When credentials are generated from Fabric CA for an ADMIN, and converted to proto:* * IdemixMSPSignerConfig.role = 0 (because role is not present in the json file delivered by Fabric CA) ({color:#FF0000}Conflicting with Attrs 1 {color})  * AND * IdemixCredential.Attrs 1  = 2 (*correct*)  *When credentials are generated from Fabric CA for an CLIENT, and converted to proto:* * IdemixMSPSignerConfig.role = 0 (because role is not present in the json file delivered by Fabric CA) ({color:#FF0000}Conflicting with Attrs 1 {color})  * AND * IdemixCredential.Attrs 1  = 1 (*correct*)     *My suspicion*:    Either there is an error with the Fabric CA on generating Idemix Credentials, or I did not pass the correct attributes when registering the credentials.     I would appreciate some help, because this seems relevant for Idemix usage.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *UPDATE:*  I started debbuging the fabric-sdk-java idemix enrollment steps and realized that actually the *{color:#FF0000}role{color}*{color:#FF0000} {color}variable is set only in the java-sdk-java with the value on the IdemixCredential.*Attrs*. This field is never present on the credentials JSON returned by the Fabric CA. That is clear now.   However, it is still not possible to use it with *peer chaincode invoke.* Since the real applications will use fabric-sdk-java or fabric-sdk-node, I just lowered the priority of this issue to *LOW.*  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *SOLUTION:*     I solved this issue by using the *fabric-java-sdk* to parse the JSON Idemix Credentials and serialize to *proto*. It worked.  ></body> </Action>

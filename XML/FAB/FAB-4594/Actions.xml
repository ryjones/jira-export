CDATA  ~jsong1230  - the issue is that you can no longer use the peer container as the CLI.  You should use the fabric-tools container instead. Please note the change in the e2e compose file here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/docker-compose-cli.yaml#L42  Please try the fabric-tools image and things should work  FYI - the error is due to the fact that the Go compiler is no included in the fabric-peer image and it is now required when using the CLI to package chaincode  ></body> </Action>

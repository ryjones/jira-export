CDATA Currently, admins are identified by explicit X509 certificates. The X509 MSP already has the ability to set NodeOUs to identify client and peer roles. We should also allow an OU to be used to identity admins as well.  For "local" MSPs, this should simply require the customer to upgrade the peer; I do not believe we need to hide this behind a capability.  For channel MSPs, we will need to hide this behind a capability.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I understand, support, and desire the feature described by this story. That said, I don’t understand the “fork MSP implementation” sub-task.  I’d really like to understand why a complete clone of the MSP is the path forward and why we think it’s a good thing to duplicate n fabric subsystems as we try to evolve them.  I can understand that as a fallback when there there are fragile behaviors that we wish to abandon.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ales   ~angelo.decaro   ~jyellick  Could you help drive this one to completion in v1.4.2 this week?  If not complete this week we should consider deferring from v1.4.2. We decided not to do the broader refactor/fork that was discussed in release-1.4 branch.   ~angelo.decaro  Also see the linked Jiras... Could the node OU support for orderer also be added? Could you work on cryptogen and CA support as well? Or do you think not essential for v1.4.2?  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="64902" issue="39710" author="siddjain" type="comment" body="I am trying to understand rationale of this task. Doesn&apos;t Fabric currently identify administrators by checking if the cert of the caller matches one of the certs stored in the `admincerts` folder in the msp dir? If so, wouldn&apos;t there be a conflict and overlap in identifying administrators if the admins are now identified depending if the caller has `OU=admin` set in their X.509 cert (as this task suggests).

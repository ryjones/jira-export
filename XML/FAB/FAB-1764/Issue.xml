CDATA Chainid becomes database name in CouchDB.  CouchDB naming conventions:  Only lowercase characters (a-z), digits (0-9), and any of the characters _, $, (, ), +, -, and / are allowed. Must begin with a letter.  Therefore, we either need to adopt these same restrictions for chainid naming, or have a deterministic mapping of chainid to a valid (and unique) CouchDB database name.  The chainid also becomes a directory on the peer file system for the block storage ledger.  Therefore the character '/' must also be avoided.  See TODO in statecouchdb.go.  ></description> </Issue>

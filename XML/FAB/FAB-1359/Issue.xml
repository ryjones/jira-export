CDATA As we are slowly moving to a setup where the behavior of the orderer is controlled by the config options captured in the genesis block and the orderer YAML file (and their overrides via ENV vars), it's time to drop the flag support that the Kafka orderer provided.  * Remove all flags from the Kafka orderer. * Add a "verbose" option to the YAML file to control logging for the package that we use to interact with the Kafka cluster (sarama).  ></description> </Issue>

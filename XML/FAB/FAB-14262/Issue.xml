CDATA Hello Fabric experts:  I always have a theoretical and general question in my mind: let's assume that there are two orgs: org1 and org2. And each org has one peer. If the endorsement policy is set to AND(org1, org2), which means that every transaction needs the endorsement from both org1 and org2's peer. Let's assume a scenario: org1 and org2 have already endorsed 5 transactions. But some day, let's say, org1 doesn't want to endorse any transaction at all, which means that for every new incoming transaction(e.g. 6th transaction), org1 wants to say no, and refuses to endorse the new transaction. So my question is: How can org1 refuse endorsing new incoming transaction? In more vivid words, as an org, how to say no? Thanks in advance.:)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fabric Release 1.0.4.  It is observed a transaction that does not have write-set is committed to the ledger by the Peer as a valid transaction even though it does not meet the Endorsement Policy.     This can result in an attack if the client is loosely coded like for below scenario:  Rogue Participant on the channel can manipulate proposal data and send a query operation to its peer for Endorsement and then push it to the orderer to be accepted on the block chain for that channel. A HFC client relying only on proposal data (manipulated in this case) + ledger valid flag (transaction accepted by Peer) will perform unwarranted operations in it own/client data store.     This needs to be fixed in Peer for transaction that does not have write-set + does not meet the Endorsement Policy.  ></description> </Issue>

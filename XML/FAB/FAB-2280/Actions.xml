CDATA They have a wiki that seems pretty thorough at first glance / ready to start doc-ing ... https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric-sdk-py.md   Would be good to have a numbered priority on these doc issues so we, i.e. the community, could tackle them in order.

Is this issue suitable for a beginner like me? If yes then I would like to take a shot at this and if anyone can provide with any resources that might help me with documenting the python sdk that would be much appreciated.

CDATA This epic relates to a series of operations equivalent to the two ERC20 functions (not directly supported by the standard UTXO model): * Approve: approve the spending of specific tokens from another party (user initially, but could also be a chaincode once FAB-11965 is completed) * TransferFrom: transfer a previously approved token by one of the authorised parties to intended recipients (authorised parties can be users initially, but could also be a chaincode once FAB-11965 is completed).  So this epic aims to initially offer Approve and TransferFrom functionality as direct token invocations, and afterwards offer these functions as outputs of an indirect token invocation. Blocker for the latter case is FAB-11965.  Initial high level design for the direct invocation of Approve/TransferFrom functionalities are discussed/analyzed  here|https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VDFv4sETTG25P2D2nW-C0Coz_XFM7elz .Â   ></description> </Issue>

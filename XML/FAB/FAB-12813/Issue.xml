CDATA Peer CLI errors out when using it to query chainless SysCC. There are two reasons for this error: # Incorrect parsing of \{{peer chaincode query -C"" -n"qscc" -c ' {"Args":  "foo" }'}}. Instead of taking {{-C}} as empty string, it sets channelID to {{-n}}  # Peer CLI requires {{-C}} to be non empty. This was introduced in commit:Â d2038953d, meant to address FAB-5604 (remove all instances of testchainid). The commit made -C a required parameter, but that prevents chainless SysCCs from being called.  I'm not sure what can be done about first problem. I tried digging up viper, but couldn't find much.  ></description> </Issue>

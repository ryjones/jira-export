CDATA The role field which is a protocol level field is currently a boolean, but it should be an int as represented in MSP. So we switch from a boolean to an integer (that is a 4-bit mask). To justify using int here:  We are planning to support more than one role at once for a combined principal (encoded in a single attribute in a credential for optimisation). So one can combine multiple Enum values in a single attribute (int - bitmask) in a credential. One can also prove predicates about that int and support more than 4 roles in the future. Now we support only 2 roles (Peer cannot use Idemix for now) with 1-1 mapping between int and MSPRole, but this change is done for backwards compatibility for the future (more roles, multiple roles, predicates about roles).  ></description> </Issue>

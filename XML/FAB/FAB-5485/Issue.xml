CDATA FAB-5329 recently fixed an issue with chaincode container names where lowercasing the name resulted in a chaincode instantiated later taking over the container name and destroying the earlier chaincode's container. This was done by adding a hash to the image name and returning the container name to include the capitalization from the end user.   The problem here arises because special characters in the peer and network ids are replaced with "-" before computing the hash. This can lead to the same issue as before since peer id "peer-2" and "peer*2" would convert to the same peer id in the container name.   ></description> </Issue>

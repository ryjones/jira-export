CDATA  ~elli-androulaki  - while we are going to update the Getting Started to alpha2 today, I'm a little concerned that your experience did not work.  The "alpha" stuff is very much baked, so it definitely should work.  Out of curiosity can you please try the following:     ./network_setup.sh down  Restart your docker process  Clear cached key vals  rm -rf ~/.hfc-key-store/*  rm -rf /tmp/hfc-*  ./network_setup.sh up     This SHOULD work!     And then proceed to run against the link Dave provided -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/e2e_cli/end-to-end.rst  - as this is the content that will ultimately replace Getting Started (albeit without running makes).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~denyeart ,   I followed the instructions on the current "Getting Started" page, that does not require any explicit compilation of the source code, as i believe docker containers are already properly equipped.  Will follow Nick's recommendation and see if this works out. Will keep you posted.  ></body> </Action>

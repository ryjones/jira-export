CDATA Thinking more about this, I have some follow up comments/questions ...  * A disadvantage to this self-signed tcert approach is that anonymity and unlinkability are not preserved if there is a rogue peer or orderer, since they have access to the ecert in order to run the proof, right?   I know this still provides a way to be anonymous and unlinkable to someone looking on the ledger, but it seems like a false sense of security since it would be vulnerable to other attacks.  Maybe I'm missing something though.  * The fabric-ca-server can be deployed so that it is not a SPOF, if that is the real goal.  It can run in a cluster.   See https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2654.  To handle a site outage, multiple intermediate CA clusters in different sites could be deployed with DB failover/replication between sites.  Of course, clients would either need to be configured to manually failover or to use a DNS-based failover solution such as http://help.dnsmadeeasy.com/dns-failover/configure-dns-failover/configure-dns-failover/  * That said, I agree that it would still be very desirable to have a solution which does not require going to the fabric-ca-server to get batches of tcerts.  Obviously one solution is to issue an intermediate CA cert to the app itself so that it can issue tcerts directly (not self-signed in this case).  This may work for a web app (few in number and relatively static) but not a mobile app since these intermediate CA certs would need to be pushed to a config block.  Are you trying to solve for a web app or mobile app?   Even for a web app, there may be complexities that I'm missing.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Assigning to Jim for redistribution.  Notes from discussion with Jim https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/WIP_fabric_v1/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/security/CryptoPrimitives.java That file needs to remove mentions to bouncycastle (as possible, discuss which are not, and how to solve). Lets use the default JCE that comes with the SDK (which will let us install PKCS11Impl provider in sdk/jre/lib/security/java.security provider list)   ></body> </Action>

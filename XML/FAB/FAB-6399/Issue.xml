CDATA As documented here:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46073111/hyperledger-fabric-v1-0-configtxlator-add-new-org-error/      When a config update arrives which attempts to modify an element nested beyond an element which does not exist, a panic can occur.  This panic is caught by the orderer and poses no risk of state corruption or being passed to the peer, however, it is still a programming bug which should be isolated and fixed.  ></description> </Issue>

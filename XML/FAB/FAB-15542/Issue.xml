CDATA ATM, peer and orderer do not provide any mechanism to pause.   As mentioned in  FAB-3364|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3364 , suggested way to take the backup of peer is, stopping the peer, taking the backup and re-starting the peer.  This is not much convenient especially in Kubernetes since it doesnt provide a mechanism similar to Docker stop.  Ideally, there should be a mechanism to pause the peer and orderer, after synching the buffers, stopping the IO, so a clean backup can be taken without stopping the peer and orderer.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are many channel add peers APIs in pte-execReqest.js for each targeted peer selection, such as OrgAnchor and AllPeers.Â  This task is to consolidate them into one API, assignChannelPeers()  Also to change the query count based on the target peer type, for example, in the case of targetPeers is allPeers, each query transaction is sent to all peers listed in the connection profile, so each transaction is counted as number of all peers.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently each language implementation is required to write its own integration tests to ensure it works.  This leaves the risk of gaps between implementations in support of basic features and also duplicates workload.  This epic is for the creating of new tool in fabric-test which will be released as an npm package which can then be run as part of the build pipelines for existing and future chaincode languages. This tool will provide a set of feature files dictating tests to run. The tool will run as a CLI against a given set of chaincode written in a given chaincode language.  ></description> </Issue>

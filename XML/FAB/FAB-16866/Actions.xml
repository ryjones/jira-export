The fix for FAB-16857 lengthens a timeout value to allow the installs to succeed within an expected timeframe; whereas this issue 16866 is really about why the instantiation and invokes succeeded.

The existing behavior is that the install lays the code on the filesystem, regardless of whether it builds.  We did make the (breaking) change that we now return an error indicating that the build failed if it fails, but for fear of breaking existing users relying on the &apos;build at install need not work&apos; behavior, we left it as is.

Agree the comment in the release notes helps: If the instantiation / build succeeds, the install timeout error can be ignored.  Moving to new lifecycle means the user can no longer ignore errors like that. Should we say that too?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Scope of the story: * QSCC queries * historydb query  Acceptance criteria: * GetChainInfo QSCC command is enhanced to return bootstrap snapshot metadata and latest snapshot metadata * QSCC queries return proper error message when the input block number and txid are below the bootstrap snapshot height * Historydb query will not include entries for blocks/transactions below the bootstrap snapshot height. Because history may be incomplete in this case, it is not recommended to transact based on history data. Need to document it.  ></description> </Issue>

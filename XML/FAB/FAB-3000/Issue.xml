CDATA Maintaining the vagrant-baseimage is difficult since we lack suitable automation facilities.  It has therefore become an impediment to producing new docker baseimages.  In addition, it is also less important these days since most of the heavy lifting is performed by the docker infrastructure.  Consider that when the baseimage for vagrant was created, we still needed to compile a bunch of basic tools (golang, protobufs rocksdb, etc).  This is no longer true: Some of the tools are now available in binary form, others are exectuted within docker, and others are no longer used (e.g. rocksdb).  Therefore, we can greatly simplify our processes by simply eliminating our reliance on a precompiled baseimage for vagrant.  Because of the dockerization effort, all we really need is a basic platform with make, git, golang-1.7, and docker.  ></description> </Issue>

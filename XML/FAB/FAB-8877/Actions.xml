Here is the link to the doc -  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/couchdb_as_state_database.html . On your query on adding checks for more fields starting reserved for couch usage - yes, seems reasonable to me.   ~chris.elder  - what do you think?" created="2018-03-15 13:55:25.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2018-03-15 13:59:21.0"/>

CDATA  ~chris.elder  - As we discussed, though a fix is submitted for documenting this restriction as a solution to FAB-10571 but I feel that only documenting this is not enough and we should add a check during simulation. In the absence of check during simulation, this causes a panic during commit. You can use this existing JIRA for adding these checks at the time of simulation for submitting a fix for both master and 1.1 branches.  You may like to explore a bit more on this what all is reserved of couch internal use. Is it only an underscore or something else as well? Also, does spaces in the beginning matter... e.g., is `_myfield` invalid but `  _myfield` valid?   ></body> </Action>

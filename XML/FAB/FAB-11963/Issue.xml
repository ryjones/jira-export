CDATA This item refers to the extension of BCCSP calls or the building of a separate BCCSP that would accommodate ZK-proofs/signature computation needs.   This would subsequently be used by Identity mixer and Token components to offer modularity at the level of underlying cryptographic primitives.   In this way substituting a software version of these operations with a hardware supported one would be possible, without modifying the ZK operations' consumers.  ></description> </Issue>

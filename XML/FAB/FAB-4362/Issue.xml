CDATA Working through the 'Getting Started' issues found that are prevent completion.      (   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html )    * For manually creating artifacts, the commands are issued fron a bin directory. Not clear where this directory is.. there is mention later about it matching your machine. But this would be better higher up * There are lots of warnings from many commands, and including lots of output that makes little sense for a first time user.  If there are ignorable warnings why are they put out at all? * ChannelID is mentioned as being needed for several commands but not info on what this is or what it could mean. Guessed at a value * In the 'Run Script Section' there is a command mentioned that will clean up.. but this doesn't exist. * After creating the channel, and then joining the channel the command to is not clear what <channel-id.block> means… it says what is returned from the command above.   *  * When running the Scripts - not clear that you have to leave the chaincode container...  When running the Scripts it is not clear that you have to cleave the chaincode container.  Early on in the guide, there are instructions to comment out a line of code in the composer file. No where is it mentioned when you should recreate this.   ></description> </Issue>

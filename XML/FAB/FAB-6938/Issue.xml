CDATA {color:#444444}In rocket.chat there was a post about an error:{color}  _{color:#444444}when i am running join peer request some times it's giving Error:file_exists, Status Code:412, Reason:The database could not be created, the file already exists{color}_     {color:#444444}I believe this can happen if peer is retrying a create database request against CouchDB.  A prior attempt to create database came back as a timeout failure to peer, but in the meantime the database got created in CouchDB.  The next retry would get the error above.  This scenario should be handled in peer code. {color}  ></description> </Issue>

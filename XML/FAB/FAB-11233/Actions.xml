CDATA These are 2 different timeouts. There was a CR merged (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24317/) recently that included refactoring the network.go file, such that the process exit wait has been increased from 1 second to 1 minute. As a result, I'm focusing on the process(channel) close timeout listed in the original issue.  For example, the following was also seen: {code} 22:12:43 • Failure in Spec Setup (BeforeEach)  2.421 seconds  22:12:43 Network solo network  BeforeEach  deploys and executes chaincode (simple)  22:12:43 /w/workspace/fabric-nightly-release-job-master-x86_64/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/integration/nwo/network_test.go:77 22:12:43  22:12:43   Timed out after 1.000s. 22:12:43   Expected 22:12:43       <<-chan struct {} | len:0, cap:0>: 0xc420357020 22:12:43   to be closed 22:12:43  22:12:43   /w/workspace/fabric-nightly-release-job-master-x86_64/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/integration/nwo/network_test.go:67 {code}  ></body> </Action>

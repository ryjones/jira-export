CDATA Long run traffic test in k8s cluster, with multiple threads and channels, (2 peers per 2 orgs) and (5) raft orderers nodes. Use mutual TLS and service discovery.  Use chaos-kube to include restarts of most peers and orderers, singles and simultaneous multiple restarts. (Save the chaos script for use in subsequent release testing, and attach to FAB-16087 which will implement the operator tool function to allow automation of chaos tests).  Avoid restarting at least one peer and one orderer, to use them to help find any small memory/file leaks. Use the metrics to monitor.  ></description> </Issue>

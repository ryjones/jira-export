CDATA Tested on above said network configuration for about 48 hrs and then restarted orderers and peers one by one manually. Also, stopped the peer for an hour and restarted. Did not find any errors while doing the above test scenarios. A minor observation is, when we don't maintain the persistent on the couchdb, the restarted peer will start recommitting starting from the oldest blocks first. Observed that this process is taking 3 mins to recommit 1000 blocks.    ></body> </Action>

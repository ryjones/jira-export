CDATA As part of our plan to remove all those json input files under CITest/FAB* folders for each admin action and test steps (create channel, update channel, install cc, instantiate cc, upgrade cc, invokes, queries, ...), we can create an API for PTE to receive an object containing the commands, args, and artifacts paths. The operator/launcher (FAB-16078) can use this to pass commands to PTE to create channels, install chaincodes, anchorpeer updates, etc, using the node-sdk API.  The https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/tools/PTE/pte-input.yml is the input file that the user will create, to specify invokes/queries traffic commands as well as admin actions such as createChannel, joinPeers, etc.  ></description> </Issue>

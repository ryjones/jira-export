CDATA According to this page, a peer can be a leader peer:   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gossip.html?highlight=leader   The leader peer is chosen through the leader peer election process.  My peers are configured with the following environment variables:  CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_USELEADERELECTION=true  CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false  However, by inspecting the peer logs, I cannot determine which peer is the leader peer (I've grepped for lead and leader). The election process and the leader/non-leader status of a peer should be logged somewhere so someone can figure this out!  Apparently the information can be retrieved by finding out about (from where?) and setting:  CORE_LOGGING_GOSSIP=DEBUG  But I think the "who is a leader" question should be answered by the standard logging - it seems to be an important thing to know when diagnosing problems in this area.  ></description> </Issue>

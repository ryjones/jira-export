CDATA We need to for filtered blocks the block type it is.  configBlock updateConfig block or endorser transaction.  The values should be the same as  in common.proto {code} enum HeaderType { MESSAGE = 0; // Used for messages which are signed but opaque CONFIG = 1; // Used for messages which express the channel config CONFIG_UPDATE = 2; // Used for transactions which update the channel config ENDORSER_TRANSACTION = 3; // Used by the SDK to submit endorser based transactions ORDERER_TRANSACTION = 4; // Used internally by the orderer for management DELIVER_SEEK_INFO = 5; // Used as the type for Envelope messages submitted to instruct the Deliver API to seek CHAINCODE_PACKAGE = 6; // Used for packaging chaincode artifacts for install PEER_RESOURCE_UPDATE = 7; // Used for encoding updates to the peer resource configuration CHANNEL_SERVICE_REQUEST = 8; // Used for packaging registration/deregistration requests for the channel service } {code}  currently filtered block structure looks as following:  {code} //FilteredBlock is sent by producers and contains minimal information //about the block. message FilteredBlock { string channel_id = 1; uint64 number = 2; // The position in the blockchain common.HeaderType type = 3; repeated FilteredTransaction filtered_tx = 4; }  //FilteredTransaction is a minimal set of information about a transaction //within a block. message FilteredTransaction { string txid = 1; TxValidationCode tx_validation_code = 2; repeated FilteredAction filtered_action = 3; }  //FilteredAction is a minimal set of information about an action within a //transaction. message FilteredAction { ChaincodeEvent ccEvent = 1; } {code}  the {{FilteredTransaction}} need to be extended to include transaction type information.   ~rickr   ></description> </Issue>

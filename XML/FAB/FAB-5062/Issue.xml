CDATA 1. in BYFN docker compose, the bootstrap peer for peer1Org2 is set to itself, which is not the intended way of usage of Bootstrap option. BYFN runs without any error as-is, but it inadvertently separates the peer1org2 from other peer of org2 and creates two leaders, instead of one, within the same org.  2. in the same file, the bootstrap to peer0Org2 is set to itself, which is not the intended behavior of bootstrap, and the line has no effect.  ></description> </Issue>

We think it is necessary to extend this function to chaincode side. Since currently chaincode only has access to worldstate, the transaction payload are both recorded in worldstate and blockchain in some cases, which causes redundancy. If the chaincode can extract the payload directly out of the blockchain, the data needed to be recorded to worldstate can be greatly reduced. Especially in the case of  providing tractability among transactions, with this function, the chaincode only needs to records the link of related transaction IDs and gets the payload from blockchain, instead of recording all the information.

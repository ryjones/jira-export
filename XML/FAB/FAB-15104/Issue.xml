CDATA The bootstrap.sh in fabric-samples/scripts is incorrect primarily wrt to parsing of cli args to obtain version numbers.  However, there seems to be a bootstrap.sh in fabric/scripts which seems to have superseded the samples one as it does not have this problem. Also the tutorials/docs recommend this option.  Hence the samples/ script can be removed (to avoid duplication and out-of-date issues such as this) or updated to solve this particular issue.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA in document `docs/source/kafka_raft_migration.md` and test source  `integration/raft/migration_test.go` STATE_NORMAL and STATE_MAINTENANCE is represented as NORMAL and MAINTENANCE which will leads to readers confusion when error showing  `NORMAL` is not a valid optional state. Meanwhile, I found additional configurations are required when restarting orderer as Raft node. We should also highlight them in migration docs  This happens in both master and release-1.4 with different locations.  ></description> </Issue>

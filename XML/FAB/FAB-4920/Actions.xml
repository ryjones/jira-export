CDATA The last block's hash would be the BlockChainInfo.CurrentBlockHash, which would also be the next block's PreviousHash.

CDATA  ~denyeart  Thank you very much!  Using the exec library of golang to execute the GetChainInfo command, then use the proto library to parse the results to the ledger.proto, which may be similar to the operation of the SDK  ></body> </Action>

Both receive all gossip messages, and are supposed to process only relevant messages. commChan&apos;s filtering didn&apos;t have an explicit check to see if the message belonged to the same Fabric channel that this GossipState was handling. This caused an issue when lots of cross-channel messages are being sent (I was adding a peer to 8 channels at once - which didn&apos;t work)" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-10-18 23:04:49.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:14:43.0" resolutiondate="2018-02-01 15:48:51.0" votes="0" watches="5" workflowId="40304"/>

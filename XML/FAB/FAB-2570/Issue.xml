CDATA As part of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2007 gossip is going to only expose public ip addresses to peers outside of a peer's organization if the peers in question are configured with such, and not expose such peers to outside organizations if they are not.  On the other hand, in membership requests, a list of known peers is sent as an optimization to avoid sending back a list of dead peers. Since when a peer sends a membership request to a remote peer can't authenticate the remote peer prior to sending the send, this is a security issue.  Therefore, I am removing this optimization in FAB-2007 and will revisit it later on when time permits.  ></description> </Issue>

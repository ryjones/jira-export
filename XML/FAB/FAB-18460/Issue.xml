CDATA - found this documentation issue, e.g., broken link.  - In this page:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/application.html   - under the Gateway section, there's the sentence "Spend a few moments examining the connection profile ./gateway/connectionProfile.yaml. It uses YAML, making it easy to read." - the link on "profile" is broken - it displays 404 page.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/main/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/gateway/networkConnection.yaml   - i think it's happened since this commit was merged.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/commit/b89ee34ff745b76922f00049df07629baaf3fe5d   ></description> </Issue>

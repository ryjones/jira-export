CDATA I'd like to suggest that having a working example web app (could be as plain as the original marbles demo) demonstrating correct and good-practice use of fabric-sdk-node, etc.  For all the hours I've put into trying to transform v1.0 fabric-sdk-node integration test code into a usable web app, I've been frustratingly unproductive compared to the same process for v0.6.  I'd suggest that defining success in the "user experience" category be largely based on the process of developing such an app, and that it is of central importance to the project -- if there's no one writing apps on top of a platform, then it's not serving its purpose.  ></body> </Action>

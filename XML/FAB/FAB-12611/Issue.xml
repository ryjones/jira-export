CDATA The existing code associates a level enabler with each logger and assumes the logger names never change. This assumption doesn't really hold when we start creating named loggers with parents.  As such, we want the LevelEnabler returned by ModuleLevels to use the most detailed level as the fast check and we want a custom core implementation to do a detailed check based on the logger name in the zapcore.Entry.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Based on an example posted by Gari in RocketChat (Sorry Gari)  In order to process the response from the getCreator call correctly it is required that the golang/protobuf/proto package be available as getCreator returns a protobuf.  However as of v1.0.0-beta this package is not available within the ccenv image. Given that this restriction is imposed by the chaincode shim and chaincode probably wouldn't normally be using protobufs, maybe this dependency should be provided within the ccenv image rather than having to declare package it up as part of the end user chaincode package.

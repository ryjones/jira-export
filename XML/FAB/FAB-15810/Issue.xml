CDATA Reconciler fetches the missing pvtData from other peers. Reconciliation should be intelligent enough to not retry pulling private data forever, based on some new configuration settings.  This may be important in the following scenarios: * private data is not available on any collection member, either because it was missing from the start, the peers that had the private data have gone away from the network, or peers had archived old blocks or have been more recently bootstrapped from a later snapshot. * with the introduction of rollback, there is a possibility of invalid pvtData transaction becoming valid (after a potential bug fix and rollback) which would result in the permantent loss of pvtData. * In some network level backup/restore scenarios, it may be acceptable to restore peers to a lower height than ordering service, implying that the private data between the heights is now missing.  When the user tries to read missing private state from the stateDB, it returns an error.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The lists are different because the one in aclmgmt also includes the peer-scoped lifecycle resources that do not reference channel policies.      I'll start by updating configtx.yaml, which does indeed include an outdated resource (QueryNamespaceDefinitions) and is missing one channel-scoped resource (CheckCommitReadiness):  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/520   ></body> </Action>

The updates match what exists in the code so the existing changes do deliver what was requested.  If we need a change, we should open another issue.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

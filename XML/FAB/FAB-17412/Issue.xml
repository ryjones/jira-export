CDATA The list of _lifecycle references here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/aclmgmt/resources/resources.go#L13-L23   is much longer than the list of _lifecycle resources in configtx.yaml:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#L149-L156   I suspect at least some of these are gaps that need to be corrected.  Also, need to verify that each of the actual _lifecycle functions check the associated ACLs.  And it appears that at least some of the names are outdated.  Finally, what is the default behavior when an ACL is not included in the configtx.yaml? Does it simply mean a policy is not checked, or is there some default policy used? This last question likely needs to be documented.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We received a report through H1 about this:  https://hackerone.com/reports/420570      The steps to reproduce are in the google document linked below.  The gist is that the default config in examples has couchdb binding to an external host instead of the loopback address.  This allows somebody in the network to delete databases and to manipulate them to get RCE inside of the docker container.  It looks like the fix is to change the default configuration of couchdb to bind only to the loopback address.  ></description> </Issue>

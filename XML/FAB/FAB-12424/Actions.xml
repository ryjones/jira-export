Will you look at the repro steps document and see if there is anything in there that is Fabric specific that would justify a bounty?" created="2018-10-12 16:28:41.0" updateauthor="dhuseby" updated="2018-10-12 16:28:41.0"/>

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris  right, that's why I was asking Gari to see if there was anything Fabric specific.  I don't see anything in here that is, I just wanted to double check.  I'm inclined to not pay a bounty and just say thanks.  Maybe mail them a t-shirt.  ></body> </Action>

Is this couchdb CVE being dealt with in the Fabric schedule?  Or has it already been dealt with?

<Action id="53974" issue="34580" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="The &quot;default&quot; for CouchDB container is to not expose to a host port.  It is only mapped to a host port in a developer tutorial where developers may want to look around at the CouchDB data, but that is not a &quot;default&quot;. We recommend not to expose to a host port in production environments.  Therefore I will close. If you think something needs to be addressed, please re-open." created="2018-11-28 23:35:31.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-11-28 23:35:31.0"/>

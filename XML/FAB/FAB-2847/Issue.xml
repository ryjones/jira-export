CDATA System: * TLS off * 3 orderers, 2 peers * using node SDK (though saw the same error when using cli commands as well) * peer image version: 0.7.0-snapshot-14055d7  After installing chaincode (example_cc) on both peers, then instantiating the chaincode on 1 peer (1a), I performed a query on 1c.   Expected (Neither happened): * chaincode container to start for peer 1c * receive initial values from the instantiation  I performed a query on 1a.  Received: {code:none} Error: Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for itzmine - transaction not found itzmine/itzmine {code}  When performing an invoke: Expected: * chaincode container to start for peer (since it didn't come up for the query) * some message that says that the invoke was completed successfully  Received: {code:none}  lccc  Invoke -> ERRO 005ï¿½ 0m ChaincodeId: itzmine does not exist on channel: itzmine(err:chaincode not found itzmine) {code}  I verified that the chaincode container was running after the instantiation for peer 1a.

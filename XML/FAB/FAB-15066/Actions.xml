CDATA Implicit collections now exist, in the sense that if a chaincode tries to write to a collection whose name matches the {{ImplicitCollectionMatcher}} {code:java} func ImplicitCollectionNameForOrg(mspid string) string { return fmt.Sprintf("_implicit_org_%s", mspid) } var ImplicitCollectionMatcher = regexp.MustCompile("^" + ImplicitCollectionNameForOrg("(.+)") + "$") {code} then we'll automatically return a collection configuration with {color:#172b4d}{{MemberOrgsPolicy}}{color} set to peers of the org only.  It is not (yet?) an advertised feature, and we may consider restricting it only to the {{_lifecycle}} chaincode (however experience has thought me that this kind of custom checks and custom validation tends to backfire).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Discussed with  ~jyellick  , since the infrastructure is in place for validating endorsement policies on implicit collections, it will be fairly trivial now to add an endorsement policy on regular collection configurations as well. This has been a highly requested feature that would make sense to expose in v2.0.

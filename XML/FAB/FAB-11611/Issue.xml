CDATA In the Production Simulation Lab network, run a test scenario forever to exercise marbles chaincode with rich queries in its own channel (e.g. marbleschannel), requiring a peer in 2 orgs to do the endorsements.Â Set debug logs to ERROR, and monitor them for errors.  Use a low traffic rate (max 1 Tx per minute) so this will run a long time before the lab runs out of disk space.  Using the same channel and chaincode and testcase, one runCases thread should specify the endorser peers, and another can run simultaneously run using Service Discovery.  ></description> </Issue>

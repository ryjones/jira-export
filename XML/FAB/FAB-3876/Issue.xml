CDATA For general details, please see the linked story.  +Test Name:+  FAB-3876_Ledger_Performance_CouchDB_VaryNumKeysInEachTX * +Description+: In this test, we observe the the performance (operations per second) of the Ledger component, with CouchDB as the state database, as we vary the number of keys in each transaction. * +Output+: (WIP) This performance test succeeds if it produces the operations-per-second number for the given scenarios. We plan to add performance tracking and comparison between runs.    Edit: As the test parameter "keysPerTx" was split into two parameters "ReadsPerTx" and "WritesPerTx", This test is being split into two parts 1) vary number of reads per Tx, 2) vary number of Writes per Tx.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Follow-up work to FAB-17659 (and the TODO in msp_test.go TestCreateApplicationMSPCRL() ):  Currently, our unit tests generate their MSP configuration using baseMSP(), which generates one cert and sets it as the root and intermediate cert (and all other certs in the config). The refactoring of MSP functions in FAB-17659 included validating that the certificate you supply to sign a CRL is one of the root or intermediate CA certs in the MSP configuration.   We need a test to ensure an intermediate cert (that is not the same as the root cert) can be used to sign a CRL.  ></description> </Issue>

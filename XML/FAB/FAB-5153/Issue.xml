CDATA In gossip there are send and receive buffers that are allocated for each connection. When the throughput of messages is too high and the send buffer overflows, the connection to the peer is closed and the peer is removed from the membership.  From performance evaluations I did - I conclude that: *  Increasing the send buffer size would benefit to withstand intense bursts of messages, even when the receive buffer stays the same. *  Not closing the connection to the peer (and not removing it from the membership) that its corresponding send buffer overflowed helps the throughput by giving the runtime an opportunity to recover in spite of an intensive burst.  ></description> </Issue>

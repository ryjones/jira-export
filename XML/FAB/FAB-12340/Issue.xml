CDATA +Environment: Release: v1.2+  This is setup which is upgraded from v1.0 to v1.2. It is seen that fabric peer cli  (v1.2.0) does not send the ledger transaction to the orderer if the endorsement response code >200. I modified the same invoke function to now use 200 and the same endorsement response proposal was sent to orderer and was part of the block.  The same steps were working on fabric v1.0 where Endorsement Code >=200 to 499 is treated as endorsement success and anything >=500 is treated as Endorsement Failure.  Our chaincode is using extensively the above range for implementation.  This is broken functionality and needs to be fixed.     Note: I am not sure how fabric-SDK behaves, did this behaviour change out there too?  ></description> </Issue>

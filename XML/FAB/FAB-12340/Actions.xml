CDATA The relevant change in v1.2 can be found at  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15737/   That appears to be a fix to pass chaincode response status all the way back to clients, and to ensure endorser fails if the status is >= 400, per the intended design as can be seen here (in all releases):   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/core/chaincode/shim/response.go#L23-L28   I believe the piece that was missed, was to update the clients (CLI and likely SDKs) to handle response status of 201 through 399 as success. For CLI, that would need to be done here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/protos/utils/txutils.go#L164   The problem has not been raised until now, because most chaincodes do not return status in the range of 201 through 399.   ~sykesm   ~mastersingh24  Do you agree with this assessment?     ></body> </Action>

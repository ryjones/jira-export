CDATA File gossip/filter/filter.go  Method SelectPeer - in case of small k, log(membership) for example, and many small channels in most cases it will return empty list - as first step it choose k peers from membership and only after that filter them, as result it will remain with zero peers  IMO, correct way to implement it is filter peers first and only after that choose k peers from filtered list.   ></description> </Issue>

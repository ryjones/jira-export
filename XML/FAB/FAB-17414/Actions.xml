CDATA I do not believe that Fabric should provide any canonical JSON serialization libraries at all, but at a minimum we must not put them in the core chaincode libraries. IMHO, this is just a specific example of the fact that keys and values need to be deterministic across invocations (well technically you might get lucky depending on the endorsement policy).  ></body> </Action>

There is really no end for utility libraries that can be used in Fabric, or Blockchain in general - starting from deterministic JSON marshalling and ending with cryptographic primitives.   I think the right approach is to have these libraries integrated in samples, and people can look at best practices and examples and choose to adopt the approach or use their own.  ></body> </Action>

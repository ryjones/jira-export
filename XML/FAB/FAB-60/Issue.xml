CDATA Story: As a developer I need more flexibility with the ledger, so that I can utilize alternate databases, have interfaces for advanced queries, and backup capabilities.  Initial external database will be CouchDB. This capability will be introduced as a beta initially, so that community feedback can be gathered.  See attachment slides for details. Broader Ledger context can be found in the Ledger slides FAB-758.  ></description> </Issue>

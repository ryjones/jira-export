CDATA  ~denyeart    ~scottz   I'm failing to understand what is the actual limitation we need to address with documentation, e.g. I'd glad if following could be elaborated a bit:  {quote} for fabric networks NOT using gossip leader election, we must document that we can support using gossip in this mode ONLY IF all peers are set as leaders when adding extra orgs and peers to an existing network {quote}  as far as I know there is an issue of adding a new organization to already existing network, where peers bootstrapped from genesis block. Since genesis block doesn't contains MSP of newly added org it will fail to communicate unless synced up till recent config. And making newly added peers statically configured to be leaders (not running leader election) solves the problem by making them connect ordering service.  However from description it's not clear whenever this is the case,  ~scottz , could you expand, please?   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="40637" issue="27885" author="scottz" type="comment" body="I am just asking for documentation on the limitation which  ~yacovm  and you have already summarized. Basically, customers may choose to use leaderelection throughout their network, or choose not to do so. If not, then they need to set all new peers as leaders; they cannot choose some to be non-leaders, otherwise they canno&apos;t be added successfully. That is a restriction that some might not assume to be true. Yes there is a &quot;workaround&quot; to simply make them all leaders. The point is that people need to be aware of how to configure things right so it all works correctly." created="2018-02-23 13:29:42.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-02-23 13:29:42.0"/>

CDATA {quote} If not, then they need to set all new peers as leaders; they cannot choose some to be non-leaders, otherwise they canno't be added successfully. {quote}  this is not correct, as you confusing the root cause of the actual problem and the "workaround" to fix it. The only restriction with respect to the gossip running w/o leader election is that users will have to maintain high availability of the statically configured leader. The FAB-5246, describes different aspect which is not a gossip limitation, but the way new organization should be added to the network, hence should we need to address it within instructions explaining how to add new org.  However I agree that leader election of gossip component need to be expanded with more details to make it clear.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA For a better and more stable product overall, if our customers must place limitations on the gossip configuration or on procedures that operators must follow to maintain a successful network, then it is still a restriction - whether gossip is the root cause or whether it is providing a workaround for something else. I am not trying to blame any one area, and you can write it up any way you feel is accurate, as long is it conveys the necessary information. We simply need to tell people about it in the release notes and the documentation - so we have explanation ready when they inevitably create trouble tickets saying "My new peers are not participating in my network".  You say something like "it is not a restriction as long as the user does something else (e.g. maintain high availability of the statically configured leader)". Exchanging one restriction option for another can provide options for the customers to consider, which may certainly be helpful, so by all means provide those suggestions. But we cannot assume that, and so if they cannot guarantee high availability, for example, then explain what is the requirement/impact.  ></body> </Action>

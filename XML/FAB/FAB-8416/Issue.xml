CDATA Per FAB-5246, for fabric networks NOT using gossip leader election, we must document that we can support using gossip in this mode ONLY IF all peers are set as leaders when adding extra orgs and peers to an existing network.  Otherwise, any nonleader peers added later in time (at least to organizations added after the initial network bring-up) would never receive any blocks.  This could be addressed in release notes , and should be addressed in docs - most likely in the gossip section  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/gossip.html  or somewhere in the Operations Guide section because it involves discussing supported gossip configurations.     ></description> </Issue>

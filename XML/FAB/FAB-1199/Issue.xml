CDATA As a developer, I want to fix the other portions in the ledger code and ledger tests that still use old block structure. This did not get caught in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2581 because, the construction of transaction for tests was also being done with in ledger tests.  I also want to remove the explicit dependency of ledger unit test on msp security related stuff.  ></description> </Issue>

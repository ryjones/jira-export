<Issue id="27260" key="FAB-7982" number="7982" project="10002" reporter="scottz" assignee="scottz" creator="scottz" type="10004" summary="failed node SDK test in vagrant in fabric-test after make pre-setup, because the new node version is not passed along to PATH" priority="4" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-01-31 03:07:35.0" updated="2019-07-30 02:40:41.0" resolutiondate="2019-07-30 02:40:41.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="35512"> <description><! CDATA     {{Project is now using node v8.9.1 (npm v5.5.1)}} {{npm version ======>}} {{5.5.1}} {{node version =======>}} {{v8.9.1}}     After "make pre-setup" in fabric-test, inside Vagrant, I see it says node version is 8.9.1, but not when I see it. {{ubuntu@hyperledger-devenv:30dd68f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test$ npm --version}} {{5.3.0}} {{ubuntu@hyperledger-devenv:30dd68f:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test$ node --version}} {{v8.4.0}}     It is not set in env after installation script is done. In vagrant file install_nvm.sh we set the version to 8.4   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/devenv/install_nvm.sh   It seems we need to push a new vagrant image.  It also seems the fabric-test/pre_setup.sh script (which executes: nvm install 8.9.4) seems to be effective ONLY WITHIN that shell and not in the environment calling that script, so we may have to execute those commands from the pre_setup.sh script to execute them inline in the Makefile when building target pre-setup.  ></description> </Issue>

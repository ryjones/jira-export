CDATA I want to remove mspMap and related code defined in msp/mgmt/mgmt.go.  As stated in the comment referenced below, these were a temporary solution, and we can now replace them with the latest channel management code.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/e188e533f88e0ba3009ac6870d824735efc720e2/msp/mgmt/mgmt.go#L49-L56  {quote}// FIXME: AS SOON AS THE CHAIN MANAGEMENT CODE IS COMPLETE, // THESE MAPS AND HELPSER FUNCTIONS SHOULD DISAPPEAR BECAUSE // OWNERSHIP OF PER-CHAIN MSP MANAGERS WILL BE HANDLED BY IT; // HOWEVER IN THE INTERIM, THESE HELPER FUNCTIONS ARE REQUIRED  var m sync.Mutex var localMsp msp.MSP var mspMap map string msp.MSPManager = make(map string msp.MSPManager) {quote} As I reported in FAB-11321 and FAB-11843, I improved the performance of my workload from 2,500 TPS up to 4,000 TPS by removing the mutex lock for mspMap.  I opened this issue based on  ~ales 's advice.   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/26055/3/msp/mgmt/mgmt.go#52   ></description> </Issue>

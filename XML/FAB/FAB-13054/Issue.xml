CDATA Currently, the method IsReplicationNeeded checks whether the last block in the ledger is less than the bootstrap block's sequence in order to decide whether replication is needed or not.   However, if the ledger contains 0 blocks, to get the latest sequence - it subtracts 1 from the ledger's height.  Since the ledger height is represented in uint64 - subtracting one overflows to the max integer number, which causes a false negative.   ></description> </Issue>

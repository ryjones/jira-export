CDATA A desirable thing to do at the end of any private data test, to validate the push/pull mechanism, is to query public data from ALL peers joined in the channel (expecting all to pass). And we could query ledger heights on all peers in the channel too, and ensure they are equal. Also, query private data from all peers in orgs included in the collection (expecting to pass), and query the private data from peers of orgs NOT in the collection (expect to fail).    If the target peers is {{ALLPEERS}}, PTE will send queries (or invokes) to all peers that associated with the specified org.  If the pte input json contains all org, then queries will be sent to all peers.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Pertaining to the previous comment, it may be useful to refer also to the README and the new functionality added to the PTE in November 2019, to select a collection name to use when submitting proposals/transactions.    FAB-13006  PTE support sideDB collection name   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-test/+/34436      ></body> </Action>

CDATA When CouchDB image was moved from fabric to baseimage, it looks the couchdb image files were copied from fabric release (1.0) branch, rather than from fabric master (1.1 development) branch.  Several improvements to the couchdb images that were made early in 1.1 development were therefore wiped out.  We need to re-apply the improvements that were wiped out (in the areas of compaction, local.ini location, id/pw).  Need to diff the file content that was removed:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15861/   with the current files in baseimage:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage/tree/master/images/couchdb      And our improvements were further reverted when moving to the couchdb official image in: FAB-8021   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17433/      ></description> </Issue>

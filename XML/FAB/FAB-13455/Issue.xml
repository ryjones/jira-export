CDATA The chain block puller is initialized in {{consenter.go}} once the chain is created.  The method that creates the block puller enumerates the TLS CA certificates from the config block: {code} 	// Extract the TLS CA certs and endpoints from the configuration, 	endpointConfig, err := EndpointconfigFromFromSupport(support) 	if err != nil { 		return nil, err } {code}  This is problematic when done only once, because a channel config might change these and then the block puller(s) for the chain(s) won't work...  we need to do it dynamically - either to create the puller each time we need one, or just replace just its TLS CA certificates and overriding them at runtime, via the *stdDialer.Dialer.SetConfig(secureConfig)* method as is done in the  creation itself|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/consensus/etcdraft/util.go#L154 .   ~guoger   ~kchristidis    ></description> </Issue>

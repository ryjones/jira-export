CDATA As there was an expectation to add multiple data models, it made sense to have a package called  kvledger|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger . We have not added any new data model other than KV since v1.0 release. Whenever we plan to have a new data model, at that time, we can think of adding a separate folders for each data model.  Â   As the kvledger package unnecessarily increases the folder depth in ledger, we remove it.  ></description> </Issue>

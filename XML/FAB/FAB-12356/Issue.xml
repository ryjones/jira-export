CDATA  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/idemix.html   Many people reading this have questions about the topology of Idemix MSPs relative to x509 MSPs.  For example, should you continue to have a x509 MSP per org, and also a Idemix MSP per org?  Or should you have a single Idemix MSP for the entire channel or network? I believe the former will provide anonymity for clients within an org while the latter will provide anonymity across orgs.  How does this relate to access control in policies and chaincode and private data collections?  These Idemix 'topology options' need to be clarified in the Idemix doc topic.        ></description> </Issue>

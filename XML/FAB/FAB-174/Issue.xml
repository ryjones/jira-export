CDATA Story: As a node admin, I need to have the ability to know what version of the fabric is running, and where to cross reference this version level with release notes, so that it can be easily understood via the documentation exactly what bug fixes and features are currently running on the node. Having this information will make it several things easy # Know what features are available in specific versions of fabric. # If experiencing an issue, that has been resolved, the version can be cross referenced with documentation(release notes) listing all bug fixes, including the needed one to patch a specific issue, that have been built into any the releases.  # If experiencing an issue, that has not been reported or resolved, this will give more information on exactly what release / build the issue is occurring, which will assist the community for quicker resolution.   Description:  Need the ability to see in the logs & via command line what the level of the fabric is being run (ie. version -v). The version indicator should have the ability to be cross referenced with release notes to see all bugs and features that have been packaged for easier maintenance and upgrade strategy for node admins. This will also help with problem reporting / description, by providing the ability to easily note what version is experiencing a current issue if, that issue has not already been posted.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The integration-test target in the makefile that was original delivered was bad and the one that was introduced in --FAB-10236-- isn't much better. Actually, it's broken since test failures don't case the build to fail...  The target should be phony and execute a script (much like unit-tests) that does "the right thing"(TM).Â  This should not be to "exec go test" in the integration test packages.  Searching for suites is redundant when we have a perfectly acceptable runner (ginkgo) to drive the tests with appropriate parallelization.  ></description> </Issue>

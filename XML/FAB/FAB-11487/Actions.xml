CDATA The wiring if serialSendAsync is odd. I don't really understand why the "sendErr" flag was added but it's been largely been preserved to keep chaincode changes incremental.  The sendErr flag is currently only set when invoking chaincode through execute. On that path, if the request fails, we tear down the connection to the target chaincode but we never release the caller of execute.  For other transactions, serialSendAsync is called with sendErr set to false. This implies that if we fail to send a response chaincode, we simply carry on. I can't explain this asymmetric behavior.  Putting that to the side, it's pretty easy to provide an error response to callers of execute when send fails. To keep most of the structure intact, I think that may be as simple as calling notify with an error response from serialSendAsync. This would be a targeted change while the asymmetric behavior is evaluated.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA v1.2: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/25357/  Making a targeted change in 1.1 but the tests are pretty badly structured there. It doesn't look like the change will have a negative impact so I'm building the CR now without an explicit test and will rely on our pipeline to detect regressions...  ></body> </Action>

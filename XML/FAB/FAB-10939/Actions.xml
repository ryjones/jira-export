<Action id="47242" issue="31485" author="wlahti" type="comment" body="I think the document is really suggesting that you refer to docker-compose-base.yaml to figure out the values for the environment variables for the peer you&apos;re trying to connect to. For example, while the CORE_PEER_MSPGCONFIGPATH and CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE variables aren&apos;t explicitly in docker-compose-base.yaml, the volumes for each container show the path to the crypto materials. The CORE_PEER_ADDRESS and CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID can be used as-is. " created="2018-07-11 18:51:20.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2018-07-11 18:51:20.0"/>

CDATA I think the whole paragraph needs a redo. I'm not sure what the original intent was here... but I think we can say that there are two ways to change the environment variables for the desired target peer.  1) You can update the default environment variables baked into the CLI container by updating these four variabes at the following location, and restarting the network: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.2/first-network/docker-compose-cli.yaml#L71-L77  2) Alternatively you could keep the CLI container defaults targeting peer0.org1.example.com, but when you make any CLI calls override the environment variables as seen later in the doc with the example call targeting peer0.org2.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA New version of this commit. I compressed the section together and removed some extraneous content, focusing on Dave's option #2 from his comment above. Hopefully this clears it up.      https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/27889/   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This task focuses mainly on the broadcast phase of the orderer. That is, from reception of a config-update-tx, its processing by the chain specific broadcast handler, until it goes into ordering by kafka.  * Change the channel config of an Orderer to reflect the extension of ConsensusType ** MigrationState ** MigrationContext * ConsensusType now carries 4 items: ** Type ** Metadata ** MigrationState ** MigrationContext  * Change the bundle's ValidateNew to allow consensus-type change, * Add a method to the bundle to approximately validate the migration steps of a new versus old config. * Add test-cases to bundle_test.go to unit-test said method.  ></description> </Issue>

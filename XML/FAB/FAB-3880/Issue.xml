CDATA For each testcase, we removed subtasks and replaced them with actual jira tasks, which will be visible on the Quality Board. So we must rename the testcases to include the new FAB numbers.  2. Move some PTE tests from daily to weekly test suite.  3. Since some LevelDB testcases were removed from testplan, we can use this subtask to delete those testcase placeholders from these scripts.  4. To allow more test coverage on smaller test environments, we modified several testcases in the testplan by reducing the number of chaincodes and channels and peer nodes and such. As such, we need to modify the network description for several testcases.  ></description> </Issue>

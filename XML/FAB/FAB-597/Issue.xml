CDATA Update unit-test target in "make file" and "documentation" to *go-sdk-unit-tests*.   In Fabric "Makefile", unit-test target name is confusing as we have Node-sdk and Go unit tests. As we mentioned node-sdk-unit-tests target for node-sdk-tests, it's better to update unit-test to *"go-sdk-unit-tests"*  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Lets say I have a UI layer which talks to REST layer which again talks to the chaincode. I have to secure all possible entries here. Using FABRIC CA I had configured security and set up the required MSP folder. Through UI and REST its properly working and doesn't allow any one to invoke the chaincode without proper security credentials.  But lets say I execute any transaction like Invoke or query, through CLI Commands with out providing any security credentials its still runs fine without any complains which is a security breach.  I'm using Fabric V1.0 Beta version as of now.   ></description> </Issue>

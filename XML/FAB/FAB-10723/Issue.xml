CDATA FAB-10720 introduces a way to persist the chaincode install packages.  In order for this to be useful, this persistence mechanism must also allow chaincodes to be retrieved.  The implementation should accept a package hash (corresponding to the hash of the marshaled chaincode install package) and retrieve the package itself, as well as the stored name and version associated with this package.  ></description> </Issue>

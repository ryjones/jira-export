CDATA Using the configuration model, create a program that will generate a valid yaml document that contains the example and/or default configuration for a structure.  The program should be provided the name of the package containing the root structure and the name of the root structure type.  The doc comments for each field should be used to comment each of the configuration elements. Where the field name is used in the godoc, it is replaced with the name of the configuration key. The documentation should properly flow to an appropriate line width while still preserving blank lines from the godoc.  ></description> </Issue>

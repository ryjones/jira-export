CDATA We are trying to understand exactly what the problem is.  Please provide more information, with the actual filepathname , or attach the dc files which are faulty. I looked in fabric repo and fabric-samples repo, but do not see any -beta image tags on any dc file.  Also, after editing the dc file, did you clean up, remove and regenerate crypto materials?  Could this be a tester error using incorrectly edited dc file, or pointing to images that do not exist?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We are still not sure exactly the steps to reproduce this, but Ratnakar reproduced that error when we do not have the correct crypto materials. My earlier question still stands:  "Also, after editing the dc file, did you clean up, remove and regenerate crypto materials?"  In addition, there is an unmerged fix to change these to rc1:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11205/   And of course, we may have to change them again, to use the official v1.0 images, once available.  I think we can probably close this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have modified the docker-compose files and regenerated the crypto materials and the sample woks with it. Should we add the files necessary to generate the conf to make it easier to maintain ?  I didn't understand what was in the config/creds folder, that's why I haven't posted my changes. What are those files and how can I regenerate those ? Could you help me with it ? (It is the first bug I try to correct)  I'll attach the files I have used to regenrate the conf and modify the dc file. (I based those files on other samples)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As  ~scottz  indicates the crypto errors are likely user error.  The remaining problem then is the reference to beta instead of rc1, which appears to be fixed in FAB-5040 /  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11205/.    ~ChristopherFerris   ~mastersingh24   ~JonathanLevi  is there intent to merge FAB-5040 / CR11205 and/or a plan to update the fabric samples to reference rc2/GA upon next release milestone?  Or better yet, can the old image references in docker compose (e.g. *image: hyperledger/fabric-peer:x86_64-1.0.0-beta*) remove the specific release tag so that we don't have to update it every release milestone, as is done in the /first-network docker compose sample (e.g. *image: hyperledger/fabric-peer*).  The reporter is out of office this week, I'm ok if this bug is closed, assuming there is a plan in place to update the samples for rc2/GA.           ></body> </Action>

CDATA First and foremost i think we need to make sure we have a UT that actually checks that read dependency... I skimmed through endorser_test and doesn't look like there is one. I guess it's introduced via the chaincode definition being retrieved via an SCC call to LSCC.getccdata (by the way... I think that for system chaincodes this doesn't apply.)  As for the restructuring - I guess it makes sense to add a check in the validator, but I'm not sure it's worth to do that for v1.2 as long as we're sure that in v1.0 and v1.1 and v1.2 we add that read dependency.  Long term:  I hate to say this - but I think all these validation checks spread across so many parts of the code (VSCC and vscc_validator, and validator) could use some consolidation. I think we should think of how to move to a model where all checks are done in VSCC.  As for _invalidTXsForUpgradeCC_  - we also get the read dependency for those in the chaincode code (handler.go:859) so why indeed not remove that upgrade check long term altogether as you suggest? makes sense to me     Adding  ~denyeart  and  ~manish-sethi   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Bulk Jira update: For remaining tasks with FixVersion v1.3.0, the Reporter should update to v1.4.0 or Future, or Close. Add a comment with any clarification needed, so that release managers can close out v1.3.0 release cleanly.  ></body> </Action>

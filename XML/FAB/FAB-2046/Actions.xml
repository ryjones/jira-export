CDATA The recent image refactoring probably caused this failure (but  ~greg.haskins   ~mastersingh24  likely know full details).  One thing.. ACL support is not there on the chaincode side yet (CRs https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5143/ and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5091/ will go some way towards ACL support). So even if you those APIs were available, they would be unusable.   Adding  ~adc .   Just saw this was assigned  ~binhn ... more appropriate to assign to  ~adc   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, at the fabric level, access is controlled by policies on the channel, where accessing chaincode requires writer policy. See this document for detail https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/policies.md  There are some system APIs for the system chaincode to make custom access decision based on policies https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6731  However, those are not (yet) considered for chaincode. The plan is to offer a separate library for chaincode to use that also includes attributes, but it is likely post 1.0.  For now (alpha), you may use GetCreator() (  byte, error) to retrieve the transactor's cert and make decision based on that.   ></body> </Action>

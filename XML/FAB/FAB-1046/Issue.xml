CDATA The current gossip component assumes the upper layers are able to fetch each remote peer's certificate by its corresponding PKI-ID (i.e hash of the cert), this is true for 0.5 but this might not be the case in v1, so this mechanism needs to be changed in the following way:  * The certificate is going to be passed in the gossip handshake along with the PKI-ID and the certificate is going to be hashed and compared to the PKI-ID the remote peer claims to be. * The certificate is going to be cached locally in a crypto module which will be a new module of the gossip component that'll invoke methods passed from upper layers (i.e- the peer's native crypto methods) with the parameters of the in-memory certificate cache. In example- it'll invoke  {code:java} verify(certificate, sig, text)  {code} where *verify* is a method from the peer's crypto module, but *certificate*, *sig*, *text* are parameters fetched from the gossip layer.  * Whenever the gossip layer of a peer learns of a peer it doesn't have a certificate of, it'll initiate a handshake with it to learn about it.     ~mastersingh24  ,   ~adc  ,  ~ellaki  ,  ~ales  --> your comments are welcome!   ></description> </Issue>

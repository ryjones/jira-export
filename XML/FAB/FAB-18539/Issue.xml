CDATA Hello everyone, i have 3 private collections with endorsement policy set as follows:  collection1: OR( Org3MSP ) collection2: AND( Org1MSP, Org3MSP ) collection3: AND( Org2MSP, Org3MSP )  i am trying to invoke a method in the chaincode that uses col1 and col2 , the sdk fails with this error: {code:java} "DiscoveryService: test-cc error: failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:\"test-cc\" collection_names:\"privateCollection2\" collection_names:\"PrivateCollection1\" > " {code} i dont know what it means but i think it cant build the endorsing plan or something related? as an alternative i tried passing manually the peers that should endorse the transaction (1 peer from org1 and 1 peer from org3) and it worked.  if i change all the AND to OR i dont get the error. considering that if i pass the peers manually the invoke succeded i think there is something wrong with the sdk.  ></description> </Issue>

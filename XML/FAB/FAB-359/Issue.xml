CDATA Bootstrapping Fabric network including bootstrapping 2 components: Orderers and Peers. Orderers make up a network of nodes with mesh connections. Peers network uses gossip to communicate with one another but direct connection with the Orderer network. All connections are TLS.  Each Orderer is configured by an administrative CLI command, which provides the necessary bootstrapping data, including a list of trusted roots, a list of Orderer certificates and IP addresses, a set of specific consensus algorithm properties, and access control policies. With this information, an Orderer may start up and connect with other Orderers.  Each Peer requires at least the following configurations: # An enrollment certificate to participate in the network. The certificate may come from any CA as long as the CA is part of the trusted roots on the consensus service that the Peer will connect to # A list of the Orderer certificates and IP addresses, which the administrative CLI from the consensus service can generate # A list of trusted root certificates # An optional list of channels that the Peer should subscribe. Unless explicitly configured, the Peer does not subscribe to any channels upon starting up    ></description> </Issue>

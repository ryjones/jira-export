CDATA CouchDB does not automatically update indexes when records are inserted or updated.  The update is performed for the index during the query operation.   This can cause delays during the query.   Subsequent queries then take advantage of the updated index.  This improvement will add an "index warming" step to refresh indexes following an insert or update.    The addition is to the EnsureFullCommit step.  This will execute an index warming action for each batch.  The index refresh will need to be called for each index defined.  ></description> </Issue>

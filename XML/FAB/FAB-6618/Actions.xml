CDATA Hi team,     Additionally - for the failed transactions (that are no fault of client) - what happens to client side logic? Should client application programatically/manually retry or client side SDK automatically retries with a configurable setting or if client side SDK retry reconfiguration settings are supported? (does it retry N number of times with delay configurable?) - which client side SDKs are supported if retry is allowed.     Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Dear team,     During my due diligence and own research - I came across this URL with a recommended sample/design pattern:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/high-throughput   Is this the recommended IBM guidance for our customers? If so - please let me know.     Thanks.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Please do not open defects for questions.  Most of your questions are answered here:   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/txflow.html   " The transactions within the block are validated to ensure endorsement policy is fulfilled and to ensure that there have been no changes to ledger state for read set variables since the read set was generated by the transaction execution. Transactions in the block are tagged as being valid or invalid.  Each peer appends the block to the channel’s chain, and for each valid transaction the write sets are committed to current state database. An event is emitted, to notify the client application that the transaction (invocation) has been immutably appended to the chain, as well as notification of whether the transaction was validated or invalidated."  The client application can retry any transaction that was invalidated.  Yes, the link in your last comment is a valid approach when there are frequent collisions. When collisions are not frequent the client retry is sufficient.  Please ask any follow-up questions in rocket.chat.     ></body> </Action>

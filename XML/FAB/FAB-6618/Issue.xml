CDATA Hello team,     Customer needs clarification as the documentation is incomplete or unclear or both:  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 valid transactions that happen in micro second interval ; the 1^st^ transaction is successful while the 2^nd^ will fail since the key changed when it first read the state; * What happens to this transaction ? (according to what I read – it is marked as invalid transaction and inserted into the ledger  this does not look right ) * How does the re-try happen ? * Will it go thro the entire flow of going thro the validation of endorsing peer etc ?     We need clarification around this.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++     References:  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readwrite.html?highlight=read%20write%20sets Read-Write set semantics  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch-deep-dive.html Section 4.1     ></description> </Issue>

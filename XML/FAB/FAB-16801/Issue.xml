CDATA Once FAB-16799 is done, create daily jobs to verify the fabric-test PTE test cases in Azure pipeline.  Note: if maintainers of corresponding repositories agree, then instead of including LTE and CTE tests here, we could move the LTE tool and tests to fabric ledger integration test suite, and move the CTE FVT tool and tests to fabric-ca integration test suite. Those tests are scoped within a single repository, and as such could be contained within the test suites within those repositories.  NOTE: Before we implement this we need to get a confirmation from Matt Sykes on the publishing daily fabric* images and binaries to nexus repository. If we don't publish these images, we have to update fabric-test Makefile to build images instead of pulling them from Nexus repository.  ></description> </Issue>

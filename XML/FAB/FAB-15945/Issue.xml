CDATA Create a new github repository called {{fabric-protos}} and populate it with a {{protos}} directory that contains the fabric {{protos}}, the necessary LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and README.md.  This repository should not be a read-only mirror of gerrit but a simple github repo.  The repository should be configured to provide write access to the fabric maintainers. This will likely require the definition of a new github team.  ></description> </Issue>

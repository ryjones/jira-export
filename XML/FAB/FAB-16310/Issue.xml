CDATA The migration to modules in Fabric Samples for 2.0 requires `GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor` to be run from the Go chaincode directory in the scripts used to launch networks. Fabcar/startFabric.sh has had this done, but other scripts, like first-network/byfn.sh do not.  We need to add the vendoring command to the launch scripts that use Go chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA > Yesterday Jason Yellick mentioned that there are corner cases that user want this kind of 'invalid' policies to prevent anyone changing. This needs to be discussed whether those corner cases apply to endorsement policies.  This comment was directed at config properties, like network membership which someone might wish to lock at their present value.  In the chaincode instantiation policy case, I'm not so sure it does make sense.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="25107" issue="17280" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="Also, I would point out, that config always rejects malformed policies.  A policy which logically evaluates to false, and a policy which is not well formed are different beasts.  I would suggest any time data is not well formed, we reject the related transaction." created="2017-06-02 13:45:48.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2017-06-02 13:45:48.0"/>

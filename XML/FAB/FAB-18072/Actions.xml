CDATA {code:java} brew install softhsm {code} You can find the full instructions for configuring it on your mac here:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/dev-setup/build.html#running-the-unit-tests   We don't ignore the tests on Mac because they can be tested using the `softhsm` library. What we do however is push the PKCS11 tests into their own test bucket so if they fail they fail late and you can still test the rest of your code.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We don't include a default location (unlike ubuntu and debian) because Brew puts the library in a versioned directory, so there is now way for us to know what version you are using and thus a default location. So we are dependent on the developer having.  We also don't support running the Peer in production on Mac so having Mac specific code in the production code doesn't make sense.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA All orgs have different chaincode definitions - no one can execute (error when the define for the channel is performed)  Proposed Steps: {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel  And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When an admin approves the chaincode package using policy "<Some different policy>" on peer "peer0.org1.example.com" When an admin approves the chaincode package using policy "<Some different policy>" on peer "peer0.org1.example.com"  And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  on "peer0.org1.example.com" Then a user receives an error response containing "<Error Message>" from "peer0.org1.example.com" And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  on "peer0.org2.example.com" Then a user receives an error response containing "<Error Message>" from "peer0.org2.example.com" {code}  ></description> </Issue>

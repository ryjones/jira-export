CDATA {quote}(starting with 1) within block{quote}   ~manish-sethi  is the seqInBlock starting from 0 or from 1?

CDATA Sorry, I missed this earlier.   ~bur  - Good catch. I'll fix the documentation. Earlier in the code, we were starting the counting of trans from 1. Later we changed in the code to start the counting from 0 but missed fixing this comment.Â   Regarding `nil`, it is ok because the type of the fields are uint64 and hence initialized to zero by default. About the String(), I am not sure whether it would be good to override default behavior of protobuf (many folks may expect it to print with a behavior of default proto String()). However, still, it does not affect us largely because everywhere in our code, we use an internal representation of version (such as see usage at -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/validator/statebasedval/state_based_validator.go#L182)    ~yacovm  - For the pvtdata the semantics are same (i.e. seqInBlock starts with 0).  ></body> </Action>

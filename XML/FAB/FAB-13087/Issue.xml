CDATA This came from code review:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27588/10/token/tms/plain/verifier.go@234      One for later, but how about we re-organise the naming conventions here? the word "output" has two meanings: 1) any new ledger keys that a transaction under evaluation proposes to create; 2) any existing ledger key that the transaction uses as input. This is somewhat confusing: case in point: the first function that checkInputs() calls is createOutputKey() followed by getOutput().  If you don't disagree, would you mind creating a JIRA please?    ></description> </Issue>

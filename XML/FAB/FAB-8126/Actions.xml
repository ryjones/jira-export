CDATA  ~aambati  as mentioned in RC, fabric-ca has both verify and merge jobs  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-ca/   Merge jobs triggers only after a patch is merged in fabric-ca repository. All I have to do is send an email to maintainers if a build is failed. Could you please provide below details.. * Could you please provide me the list of maintainer email ID's or just say to whom I have to send the failed build notification email * Do you want me to send an email, if the build fails on s390x as well?  ></body> </Action>

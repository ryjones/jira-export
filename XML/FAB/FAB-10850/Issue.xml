CDATA PTE addsÂ frequency option for multiple requests of the service discovery initializiation/refresh.  This is not an invoke, but rather an API call to trigger the discovery functionality in the fabric peers, in order to get a response with a new layout of peers. Therefore we may use discoveryOpt, which is a different implementation in PTE code than the transMode option which is used for controlling the frequency of invokes.  ></description> </Issue>

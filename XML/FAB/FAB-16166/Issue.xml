CDATA Presently, the code package file is determined by process of elimination.  This dates back to the original requirement for CAR compatibility, which was an archive format which was not a tar gzip, but was instead something else.  So, there was a need to be able to name a code package as 'Code-Package.tar.gz', or 'Code-Package.car' in order for commodity tooling not to get confused.   We have since dropped support for  CAR, so all archives can be required to be tar gzs.  Thus, let's require the package to be consistently named 'code.tar.gz'.  This has impacts in the peer CLI, the Java SDK, and the Node SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We were recently asked for better/clearer/explicit guidelines/best practices as to how to create JIRA tickets - this includes the criteria for filing something as an *Epic* rather than a *Story* or a *Task*, how to write it up so that it is easier to auto-generate the change-logs... etc.  The maintainers can review this and we'll add it to the public contribution guideline and/or the wiki.  —--- June 13, 2018 Update:  We have all been very good at spreading the message of "don't just complain/ask for a feature/report a bug" - please put this is in JIRA so that it does not get "forgotten".  However, I still feel that we should really have some "best practices" document and agreed-upon guidelines as to "how to" create JIRA tickets in  https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/FAB.    I didn't have the capacity for this, back at the time (of the glorious Fabric 1.0 days), but if nobody picks this up still, then I can just do it.  -- Jonathan  ></description> </Issue>

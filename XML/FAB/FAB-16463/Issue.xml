CDATA As a Fabric client developer, there are useful utilities in cauthdsl that I would like to use in my application.  The Fabric Go SDK currently maintains a copy of the utilities (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl). It is preferable to stop needing to copy from Fabric and instead be able to make usage of common components.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Chaincode objects are * containers * images * system chaincodes  Using chain ID as part of the namespace naturally provides instantiation of chaincodes across chains. This is especially important for system chaincodes for which the code is inbuilt into the fabric (this was anticipated in the notion of "instance" for system chaincodes (see core/container/inproccontroller/inproccontroller.go)  ></description> </Issue>

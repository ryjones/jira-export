CDATA Currently, gossip stores blocks in several places:  * Message store, to know if a message was received before, or not, and also to be used by the pull mechanism to provide blocks to other peers that request them * Payload buffer (in the state module) to reorder blocks that are received.  This poses a problem when blocks are huge. i.e 10MB blocks might sum up to 1GB of memory.     ~C0rWin   ></description> </Issue>

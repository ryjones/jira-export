CDATA In the gossip tests there is a waitgroup counter that is used for the last test (that checks that goroutines ended) to be able to run only when all the other tests have finished.  Currently the waitgroup counter is initialized to the number of tests that can be stuck, but should really be: * Exported into a constant * Initialized to the total number of tests    ></description> </Issue>

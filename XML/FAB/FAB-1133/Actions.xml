CDATA  ~bfuentes@fr.ibm.com  -   We don't really have any plans to make any changes in this area given this is v0.6 and also that we really want to remove the ability to deploy chaincode in this manner (basically via the REST API).  The best thing to do is to start using something like gpkg.in URLs for your packages rather than directly using github URLs in your packages.   You can checkout https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/cc-commercialpaper   for an example of how you can use gpkg.in in combination with github branches and/or tags to actually "version" Go packages   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you  ~mastersingh24  for quick answer. I will do some tests with gpkg.in in the next days so  :)  ></body> </Action>

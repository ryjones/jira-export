CDATA After the chaincode is upgraded, older chaincode docker containers are not deleted and are left in a stale state unless the blockchain peer admin manually deletes it. This process of removing older chaincode containers should be automated as part of the chaincode upgrade process as not deleting it manually consumes resources on the host system. Several clients have requested for this feature and would recommend this feature be added in the upcoming versions.  Outdated chaincode images should also be cleaned up.  ></description> </Issue>

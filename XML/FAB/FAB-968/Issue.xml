CDATA Logrus is currently vendored as it is used by the go-dockerclient (I believe).  The vendoring is a bit messed up (some odd files) and the version in there does not compile natively on OSX.  As an aside, I am also going to propose moving to using this package for logging in general, so will be good to update it  ></description> </Issue>

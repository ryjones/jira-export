Partition one orderer (leader) for a few minutes, observe the others elect a new leader; and then rejoin. also expect leader to step down as follower (return SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE: no raft leader), because it cannot reach quorum  bq. If it was the leader, then its heartbeats would continue to reach the other orderers, and I wonder if this would prevent them from electing a new leader? If so, then the network would effectively halt. if leader does not receive heartbeat response from quorum for {{ElectionTimeout}}, it voluntarily steps down to follower.  ></body> </Action>

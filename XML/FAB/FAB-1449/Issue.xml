CDATA Some messages in gossip aren't signed, because they are sent only point-to-point, so the identity of the sender can be extracted from the PKI-ID that's sent during the comm layer authentication.  In order to support multi-channel related access control for messages that are point-to-point I need to add getPkiID to the interface.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the previous deployment model where chaincode was stored on the channel, the LCCC maintained version information for upgrades. With the new model proposed in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1783, the chaincode code is not associated with a channel, only its instantiation is. It is now the responsibility of the user to specify version. This version is a user-friendly name for the hashcode associated with the package of the chaincode and so has to be linked to it.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1920 details package creation. The package would contain  ** the chaincode {code, name, version} ** the policy for the chaincode usage ** hashcode computed with the above ** signature on the hashcode  On instantiation of the chaincode on channel, the LCCC for the channel would maintain the {name, version, hashcode, signature} for the channel. It will allow the instantiation to proceed only if the hashcode tallies.  Future launching of the chaincode (say after restart of peer) will validate the package based on the entry in the LCCC.  TODO - The security aspects of tying in version, hashcode to instantiation will be treated in a different JIRA item.  ></description> </Issue>

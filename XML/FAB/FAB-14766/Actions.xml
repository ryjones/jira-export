CDATA w.r.t the term *etcdraft*/*raft*/*Raft*, we current do have a mix of them and i think we should have consistent name.  I think we should definitely note etcd/raft lib in docs. However, if we use the term etcdraft heavily in code/logs/tutorials, it may sometimes confuse users, as i once got question asking whether we are depending on etcd, the distributed kv store.  I'd vote for using Raft whenever possible. However, this is somehow invasive because we are heavily using etcdraft in current codebase.  does anyone know the reason we started off with etcdraft? it's very likely that i overlooked some important reasons here..  cc  ~jyellick   ~yacovm   ~yacovm   ~tock   ~adarshsaraf123   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I also agree that we should use Raft and not prefix with etcd. We can still stay with the consenter type "etcdraft", and just use "raft" in the logs... that's my opinion.  Â   I think Kostas wanted etcdraft from a reason that if someone wanted to get another Raft implementation (i.e - consul) then "etcdraft" will be specific enough to not confuse users.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I understand where you're coming from and I actually meant to make this an "improvement" rather than a "bug" (but somehow can't seem to be able to change it) because there is nothing broken per se but rather than fight what people are doing I think we're better off accepting it.  I think it's natural for people to build on top of the samples we provide, so we should have that in mind and make them a good basis for people to build on rather than try to tell them not to follow our examples.     ></body> </Action>

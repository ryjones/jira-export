CDATA With moving content from Gerrit to Github, we are seeing a real increase in first time contributors. But there is a problem with them forgetting to sign their commits even though it is documented in the Contributing guide.  Suggestion was made to 1) Add a link to the Contributing guide from the Fabric readme. 2) Create a short 1 minute video that shows the process for creating and submitting a PR. Joe was nominated :-) Publish it on the Hyperledger Fabric YouTube channel.  ></description> </Issue>

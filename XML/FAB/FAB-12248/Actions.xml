<Action id="51543" issue="34247" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="You must specify the ID of the orderer system channel when sending transactions to it to update the channel configuration (such as modifying a consortium definition).  Today, many of our sample simply omit the channel ID when creating the orderer system channel&apos;s genesis block, and therefore that channel is given a name of &apos;testchainid&apos;.  This name is generally confusing, if anything, a default of &apos;orderer-system-channel&apos; or similar would make sense.  However, I think it&apos;s probably generally better to force the user to pick a name for the orderer system channel rather than supply any sort of default, this is why that error message is emitted as we intend to disallow the default channelID in the future." created="2018-10-02 18:06:04.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2018-10-02 18:06:04.0"/>

CDATA This is a follow-on doc defect to address the root cause problems found in FAB-4243. In a nutshell, in order to utilize CouchDB in a highly concurrent environment with large number of channels (CouchDB databases), several OS and CouchDB settings need to be configured.  In addition to documenting the OS ulimit setting (FAB-3464), the OS ephemeral port settings and CouchDB max_dbs_open parameters need to be documented. For details see FAB-4243.

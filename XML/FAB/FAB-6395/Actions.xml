CDATA  ~rameshthoomu , I have updated the package.json dependency for fabric-rest to be:  "loopback-connector-fabric": "^1.0.0-snapshot",  However it looks like the verify build for  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/14111/  is still trying to use version 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.0-snapshot.     npm ERR!

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu  thanks for fixing the verify build.  I can see failures that look like the merge build is also failing because it is cloning the master branch. Do you want a separate work item for that problem?  ></body> </Action>

Please rebase patch and merge. It should work.

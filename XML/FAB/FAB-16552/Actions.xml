CDATA While adding the support for update to private data collection configuration, we needed to persist additional information in the transient store. As a result, the code for transient store happen to maintain both old and new value format -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/86f87ebcd8a1819e3832b289f2d94d4a88bb6e05/core/transientstore/store.go .     The functions dealing with old format should be deleted as the consumers have started using new functions.     Also, for cleanliness, rename the new functions to the regular names (that is currently used by the old functions).     Specifically, remove function "Persist" and rename function "PersistWithConfig" as "Persist". Similarly, remove function "Next" and rename function "NextWithConfig" as "Next"  ></body> </Action>

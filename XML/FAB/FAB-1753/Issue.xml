CDATA Proposals are sent by a client to an endorser and with the current architecture trigger the invocation of a chaincode, and is followed up with a ProposalResponse.  Client-endorser communication is protected with TLS. However, a malicious peer, could try to impersonate a client to another peer and consume other endorser resources.  This is not a critical attack, cause (i) we currently do not support confidential contracts at the fabric level, (ii) chaincode proposals have the same chaincode content regardless of the endorser they refer to, (iii) the malicious peer cannot eventually contract a valid transaction without the original proposal creator's key.   A simple way around this attack would be to include in the signed proposal proto message the recipient's endorser/certificate. Recipient name is not necessarily included in the final transaction.   ></description> </Issue>

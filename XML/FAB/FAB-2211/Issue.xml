This means that files like core/chaincode/shim/java/*.class might be included since core/chaincode/shim is subordinate to the chaincode shim.  Aside from being suboptimal/confusing, this may sometimes lead to problems compiling.  This should be cleaned up." priority="4" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-02-13 15:20:48.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:11:37.0" resolutiondate="2017-02-28 02:17:03.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="37420"/>

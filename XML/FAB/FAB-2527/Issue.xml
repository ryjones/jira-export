CDATA Merging methods into fabric v0.6 JAVAChaincode from fabric-sdk-java v0.6 ,such as getRows/setEvent/,adding dependencies of build.gradle .And changing  Markfile  line 220 to "echo core/chaincode/shim/java | tar -jcT - > $(@D)/javashimsrc.tar.bz2" .Then I excuted make clean/make peer successfully.So,I excuted peer node start .In this step,i cannot see the information   " genesis  funcl -> INFO 00f Creating genesis bock" after repeating several times.The result was that I always got the message " chaincode  Launch -> ERRO 01a launchAndWaitForRegister failed Timeout expired while starting chaincode" when I excute peer chaincode deploy repeating several times though raising startuptimeout and deploytimeout 3 times.  After deleting the directory /var/hyperledger/production/* and recovering all fabric I  changed except raising startuptimeout and deploytimeout 3 times and the debug module of core.yaml ,then excuting "make clean"/"make peer"/"peer node start"/"peer chaincode deploy" ,the debug information is in Attachment.  ></description> </Issue>

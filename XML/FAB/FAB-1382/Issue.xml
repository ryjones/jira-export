CDATA Per some performance testing feedback from  ~bcbrock  it's much more efficient if we allow HTTP2/gRPC to handle the connection data windowing rather than attempting to implement it ourselves at a higher layer.  In order to remove windowing from deliver, there must be some other mechanism supplied to allow a client to retrieve a specific number of blocks.  This means that the Deliver API must also be enhanced to allow range specification.  ></description> </Issue>

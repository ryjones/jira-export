CDATA  ~cdaughtr  has done the work to merge all subsequent changes to v0.6 and master in the original location (fabric/sdk/node) to the new project (fabric-sdk-node), tracked in FAB-659. so there's no need to keep the old code around in fabric.   ~greg.haskins   ~rameshthoomu  want to make sure you guys are aware of this planned action. Hoping to do it asap. Would there be any concerns w.r.t the build steps and CI jobs? we'll for sure clean up the make file as part of this.  ></description> </Issue>

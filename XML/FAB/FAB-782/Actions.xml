CDATA  ~jimthematrix   ~cdaughtr : We have new job created in jenkins for Fabric-sdk-node repository and executing headless-tests.js for every commit pushed to this repository. I will remove verify and merge sdk node jenkins jobs from jenkins which are running on v0.6 branch.   This change will not effect node-sdk build process but you have to remove the references in from fabric doc folders. Also, please do let me know when I have to disable node-sdk jobs from Fabric repository.  ></body> </Action>

Will try out moving the node sdk doc to fabric-sdk-node project, and assess to see if the new format is acceptable to the hyperledger community." created="2016-10-25 14:28:58.0" updateauthor="cdaughtr" updated="2016-10-25 14:28:58.0"/>

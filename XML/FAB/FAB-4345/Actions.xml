CDATA I think you are confusing the settings here.  What exactly are you trying to prove / test here?  Maybe the bug is that you should not be able to set both orgleader and useleadelection to false?  ~yacovm  ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA {quote}   peer1.org1.example.com: - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP=peer0.org1.example.com:7051  peer1.org2.example.com: - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP=peer1.org2.example.com:7051 {quote}  The bootstrap peer of peer1.org2 is itself, instead of peer0.org2 What happens in the e2e is as follows: {quote} ## Create channel echo "Creating channel..." createChannel  ## Join all the peers to the channel echo "Having all peers join the channel..." joinChannel  ## Set the anchor peers for each org in the channel echo "Updating anchor peers for org1..." updateAnchorPeers 0 echo "Updating anchor peers for org2..." updateAnchorPeers 2 {quote}  So, the genesis block contains no anchor peers, and then a config transaction is created that adds anchor peers, but peer1.org2 can't fetch it because it's configured to not connect to the ordering service. If you try to set the bootstrap peer of peer1.org2 to be peer0.org2 you'll see that e2e finishes successfully.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~yacovm  to clarify, will the following setup work? if not, why not?  Organization1 has three peers 1) peerA: anchor peer and leader peer, no bootstrap defined 2) peerB: non-anchor, non leader, bootstrap set to PeerA 2) peerC: non-anchor, non leader, bootstrap set to PeerB   edit: what I am trying to get is that what should I set a peer's bootstrap to, or if thats needed at all for all peers.  ></body> </Action>

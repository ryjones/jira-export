CDATA {color:#000000}I would like to spawn multiple instances of the example network on the same VM. We have multiple users working on the same VM and each would like to work with his own instance.{color}  {color:#000000} {color}  {color:#000000}Based on our understanding of the docker compose, we decided to use a different COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME for each user.{color}  User 1 used COMPOSE _PROJECT_NAME=member1 and launched the example.User 1 could see the following containers - please find attachment *member1_containers.txt*   User 2 used COMPOSE _PROJECT_NAME=member2.When he launched the example, he was expecting all containers to have u1 as a prefix.User 2 could see the following containers - please find attachment *member2_containers.txt*  *Note that the chaincode container dev-peer2-example02-1.0 started by user1 vanished and was replaced by the chaincode container of the same name started by user2.*  I guess this is because the peer launches the chaincode container without prefixing it.     ></description> </Issue>

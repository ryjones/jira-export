CDATA I am going through the documentation in order, and very often the words "peer", "orderer" and "endorser" appear.  However, those were never defined. They don't ever appear in the "Key Concepts" section, and then start appearing without context later in the documentation.Â   With time, I am starting to understand their meaning (I think?) however it would be a lot easier if those were explained in the key concept section, as they seem like important keywords!  ></description> </Issue>

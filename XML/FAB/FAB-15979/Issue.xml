CDATA This documentation was last updated for v1.1, the first release with capabilities. It needs some polishing and cleaning up and context now that we know more. Also, it would be useful to add information about levels of capabilities and what was added where. Ideally, the conceptual information about capabilities will be split/expanded into its own "Key Concepts" doc, as it's become more important for people to understand capabilities as we progress in versions and the number of potential capability configurations increase. The lower level information currently in the doc would remain in the "current" doc, with the conceptual information removed.  Will write this for master, but ideally should also be cherry picked back to v1.4.  ></description> </Issue>

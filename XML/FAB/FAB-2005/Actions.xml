CDATA Would be better to give links on the mix introduction and how's the process like "https://www.zurich.ibm.com/identity_mixer/".  Then it will be more clear how to be integrated with existing fabric architecture.  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~elli-androulaki   ~dubovitskaya   It sounds like the first target for SDK would be java sdk.  But there is only a JIRA work item for go sdk.  Please clarify and create java sdk work item (assuming it is needed).  ></body> </Action>

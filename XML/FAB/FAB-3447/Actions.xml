CDATA Hi Rick, thanks for reporting this.  I am slightly skeptical about this, given that: * https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/multichain/manager.go#L228 suggests that you cannot skip the consortium name when you send out a channel transaction, and * https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/multichain/manager.go#L245 suggests that if you refer to a consortium that doesn't exist you will get an error.  Can you please upload the YAML file that you used along with a detailed listing of the minimum steps one needs to follow in order to reproduce this?  Thank you.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I would point out that indeed, it is perfectly valid to start the orderer without any consortiums defined.  But, as  ~kchristidis  points out, channel creation should fail unless the appropriate consortium information is set.  In addition to the YAML file could you include the commit you are reproducing this at? There was a brief period of time where both the consortiums and the old channel model configuration were present, and this behavior could have been observed, but that behavior should no longer be present.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Will close, as this hasn't been updated with the requested info for more than 2w now.  Feel free to re-open if details to reproduce are provided.  ></body> </Action>

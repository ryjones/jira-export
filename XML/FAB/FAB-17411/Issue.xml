CDATA There are many doc references in master to prior version such as v1.1 and v1.2 references here:   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_control.html#migration-considerations-for-customers-using-the-experimental-acl-feature   In this case, the content was intended for users upgrading to v1.2. It can be removed in v2.0 doc since we expect users to upgrade one step at a time (e.g. from v1.4 only).  More generally, grepping /fabric/docs/source for v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v1.4 returns many results. Some can be kept (e.g. when documenting when a feature or capability entered Fabric), but others should likely be removed at the v2.0 boundary.  ></description> </Issue>

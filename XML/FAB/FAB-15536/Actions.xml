CDATA For the sake of clarity, after the discussion with  ~scottz , I want to add:  _I'm requesting that this personal information that is stored in the logs should be removed as long as the proper information is deleted. There's no problem this info is stored in the logs as long as the information is available but, as soon as this information is requested to be deleted, the system should make sure to clean this info from the logs._  ></body> </Action>

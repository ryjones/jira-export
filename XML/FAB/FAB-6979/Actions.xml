Usage in fabric examples would be nice, but minimally I think some more usage notes are needed.

CDATA  ~denyeart  yes, I can do that. Will try to get some usage nodes done this week(end).  SetEvent is still legitimate but we don't actually emit the event (like we do with Block event). The CC event is in the TX in the block. SDK and users would have to extract it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I pushed an initial attempt at this to gerrit:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/17605/   Some of the information about GetBinding() was based on the following Google doc, which I found linked in FAB-634:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/18XDGqxb3pz4sTS6jTJod1KufRSC7rRA-O3PMT5cUsqY/edit#heading=h.2o87atnjtrt2   ></body> </Action>

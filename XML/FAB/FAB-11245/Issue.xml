CDATA Looking at the MSP config from the channel definition, theÂ   `client_ou_identifier` and ` peer_ou_identifier` under `fabric_node_ous` is not an array which prevent from setting up multiple client/peer ou identifiers.  This is a serious problem for any 'real' deployments which want their CA servers to be HA so have multiple intermediate CAs.  ></description> </Issue>

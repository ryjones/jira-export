CDATA Discussed in FAB-17472 and we ended up deciding not to make the nodeous an array as that would require a capability change.  Instead, the chosen workaround was to allow the node ou Certificate to be unset. This allows the node ou to be issued from any of the org's CAs.  This was documented with a sample at  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msp.html#identity-classification:    {code:java} Certificate: (Optional) Set this to the path of the CA or intermediate CA certificate under which client (peer, admin or orderer) identities should be validated. The field is relative to the MSP root folder. Only a single Certificate can be specified. If you do not set this field, then the identities are validated under any CA defined in the organization’s MSP configuration, which could be desirable in the future if you need to add other CA or intermediate certificates.{code}  ></body> </Action>

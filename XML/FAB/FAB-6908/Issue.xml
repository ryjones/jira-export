CDATA The daily-test Jobs build no.142,144,145 get stuck on test FAB-3888. job 143 got stuck on FAB-4663 (after 3888 ran and failed due to timeout). Both scenarios get stuck when first trying to refer to "initial leader". Adnan touched this logic in his update,  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15179 . So the backend function is behaving inconsistently. And the functionality is not working (in addition to the timeout stopgap code behaving inconsistently)  *Build Log*  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-x86_64/141/   *Commits*  FABRIC_COMMIT ===========> 6f10a5f CA COMMIT ========> 63b8a57  ></description> </Issue>

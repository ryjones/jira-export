CDATA A new environment variable (FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC) has been added, and support for the CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL and log module overrides has been removed, with  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27042/  , FAB-12487.  There are many places that use CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL that must also be changed. Some may not be immediately apparent in test results, but should be proactively fixed. I am attaching a list of them from fabtric-test (which also has submodules for some other repositories, so you will also see some instances from fabric, cello, fabric-samples... in the data.) If necessary, we can split this list up into multiple tasks.  Note: the examples in the description of story https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12357Â show how to set different levels for individual loggers, for the cases where you don't want to just set everything to one level.  ></description> </Issue>

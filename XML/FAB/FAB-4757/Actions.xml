CDATA i think this is a cool idea but agree with  ~markparz  it's too much.   i think this is one part where animation would be really helpful because we're trying to have the graphic do too much. it really needs to be two or three diagrams.  I would isolate parts further in the network and remove the bits on the left.   ></body> </Action>

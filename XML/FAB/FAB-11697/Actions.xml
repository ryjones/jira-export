CDATA It has been passed since your last comment. Is there any changes for this issue?  I wanna use mongodb as statedb because of the poor performance of couchdb - especially on write action.  In my lab, I changed statedb to mongodb plugin( with official mongodb driver) and I can get almost almost same TPS with goleveldb.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="70097" issue="33151" author="JIRAUSER20663" type="comment" body="I&apos;m at MongoDB so let me know if there is anything we can do to help with supporting MongoDB in Fabric. It totally makes sense to support a pluggable architecture. I see other tickets saying transactions was important and features historically associated with RDBMSs, and MongoDB does now support ACID transactions across a distributed cluster of any size. Without knowing all the requirements, I can&apos;t say how good a fit it is, but being around 10 years now we have many features expected in databases and very active development. I searched for more info around pluggable storage architecture in the docs and didn&apos;t see more information. if someone has docs or Jira ticket for a pluggable storage architecture, please link/include them.Â " created="2020-08-27 20:15:59.0" updateauthor="JIRAUSER20663" updated="2020-08-27 20:15:59.0"/>

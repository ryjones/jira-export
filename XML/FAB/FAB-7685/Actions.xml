CDATA The error was from the pkcs11js package which is used by fabric-client.  There were some warnings in the native code which is included with that package.  These issues have been fixed in the latest versions of pkcs11js.    I was able to see the warnings during compilation by installing v1.0.12 of the package `npm install pkcs11js@1.0.12` on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.  With the latest, there is no error.  Closing this as the warning messages were benign in any case  ></body> </Action>

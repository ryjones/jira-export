CDATA In test 2 orderers started. Client connects to one of them and get 1 block. After that active orderer moved to status FAIL So it is possible to open connection to it, but for each request it replies SERVICE_UNAVALIABLE Once client gets such status, it disconnects from orderer, wait for while and try to reconnect But failed orderer still accept connections So, by probabylity 1/2 it will connect to failed orderer, get same SERVICE_UNAVALIABLE, disconnect and try again And because now we have sleep between tries, it will reach timeout after relatively small number of tries.  ></description> </Issue>

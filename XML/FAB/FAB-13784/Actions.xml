CDATA Given the multiple stages, this should stop as soon as a failure is encountered rather than keep going with incorrect information.  The first failure is right after the 75second sleep (???) 	time.Sleep(config.AliveExpirationTimeout * (msgExpirationFactor + 5)) // (0.3s * 10  * (20 + 5)) == 75 seconds  The code has some "what" comments, but I could use some more "why" comments to understand what this test is doing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The "Setting up the development environment" doc  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/dev-setup/devenv.html  currently contains two options for development. Native Docker or Vagrant.     The way the two are mixed together has been confusing for new Fabric devs. The docs also make it sound like the Vagrant path is deprecated, should not be used, and will removed in the near future. A conversation on the mailing list reveals that some are still using Vagrant and wish to support it going forward.      https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2018-March/003210.html    https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2018-April/003300.html      I suggested we that we move the Vagrant instructions into their own page to reduce confusion. The "Setting up the development environment" page will link to this page with a brief note indicating that Vagrant is not the primary path. We do not need a paragraph of history explaining the switch. That can live on the dedicated Vagrant page if we wish to keep it.     I will volunteer to make this update to the docs, but I cannot volunteer to maintain this doc page or Vagrant as I don't personally use Vagrant for Fabric dev. Someone else will have to take on that duty. If the Vagrant doc or script become stale, it could be removed in the future.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~rickr  - my comment was based on the first line in the Description: {noformat} Java SDK looks odd to have when we can't deploy java chaincode.{noformat}   ~denyeart  We don't currently have a model for experimental features nor a model for an experimental channel (which is actually what I think we should do - no need to have the ability to enable experimental features in production code).

CDATA making it hard enough to enable is good enough in my opinion, so it's clear one has to jump through hoops to get it working, and you are on your own at that point.  Maybe leaving the code in, but remove javaenv from make docker, and document the code snippet to add to makefile to add the image (and prominently label it as experimental).  also note that neither of node SDK or java SDK supports java chaincode packaging. using it would also require figuring out how to build the archive to send to the peers through the SDK (both SDKs support using user-built archives as chaincode package). So that's already another layer of difficulty.  Point is I don't think we need to remove the code, and it'll be enough hoops to jump through already.  ></body> </Action>

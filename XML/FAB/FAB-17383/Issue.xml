CDATA The chaincode test tool should be able to run multiple network setups. This implementation for this should be easily expandable for contributors to the tool.  Orginally there should be a single and multi-org (three) setup. The tool should only run specific features (tagged) for a network.  Adding a new network should be documented for contributors and require minimal file additions (docker and crypto definitions)  ></description> </Issue>

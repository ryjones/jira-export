CDATA In many places we do the following:  ``` sc := &SimpleCollection{}  err := sc.Setup(...)  ``` This seems unnecessary and we should encapsulate this behavior in a constructor. Let's create the following:  ``` NewSimpleCollection(...) // takes same arguments and executes same behavior as Setup(), requires a CollectionConfig to be passed and will be used by PrivateDataProvider  NewSimpleCollectionByCollectionCriteria(...) // this constructor allows us to pass in the SimpleQueryExecutor, ChaincodeInfoProvider, and IdentityDeserializerFactory dependencies to fetch the CollectionConfig directly from the constructor  ```  Â   For now let's keep Setup as is for consumers that already have a SimpleCollection beyond an empty SimpleCollection so they can still call Setup as needed.  ></description> </Issue>

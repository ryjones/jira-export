CDATA I ran 500 threads from 5 VMs and observed "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE".  info:  2019-02-26T21:12:05.897Z PTE 67 main : stdout: info:  2019-02-26T21:12:05.804Z PTE 67 exec :  Nid:chan:org:id=0:testorgschannel368:org2:0 invoke_move_dist_evtBlock  failed to sendTransaction status: {"status":"SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE","info":"no Raft leader"}  In one instance, channel 98 lost leader for 5 min.  See attached orderer logs and leader graph of channel 98.  We may need to reduce the number of channels to find out the max number of channel that the network can support.  ></body> </Action>

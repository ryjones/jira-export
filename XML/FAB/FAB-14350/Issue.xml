CDATA h2. Summary  This objective of this test is to evaluate the functional impact of a network with large number of channels under heavy traffic  h2. Setup  Same setup as in FAB-13601, with the following differences: # create 500 channels: {{channel1-channel500}} # install/instantiate samplcc chaincode on all channels # 3 peers with 1 peer/org # 3 orderers in orderersystemchannel # {{batchSize.maxMessageCount}}: 500 # logging level set to {{info}} (and if we see errors, then we can re-run test with debug-level logs in the orderer package per FAB-13597)  h2. Inputs # Start 1 thread transaction to one org's peer for each channel, total 500 threads # Each thread sends 10K invokes, using PTE constant mode, i.e. sending next transaction as soon as the previous one is sent to and ACK'd received by the ingress orderer.  Total 5M transactions. # All transactions from a single thread will target the same orderer.  h2. Expectations # No errors in the logs of peers and orderers. # No failures or errors reported by PTE. # All transaction events are received by PTE.  ></description> </Issue>

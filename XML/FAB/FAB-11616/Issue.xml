CDATA Setup:  Network Topology: 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels. CouchDB as StateDB, endorsement policy is 2-Org AND.  Batchsize 500 or more GOMAXPROCS set to 4 Client Driver: PTE Test Steps: 1) chaincode: each channel has one chaincode, (EndorsementCC), instantiated 2) 100K transactions (initial phase) 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 invokes concurrently. All the threads to set both value and SBEP  in the same peer and same channel. 3) 100K transactions (test phase) 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 invokes concurrently. 2 threads to do value update only, 2 threads to do SBEP updates only, for the same keys. Result: 1)hardware setup 2) TPS (invokes per second) achieved for step 3 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers.  ></description> </Issue>

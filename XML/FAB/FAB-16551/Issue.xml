CDATA Each test step is executed by test driver in sequential order. Each performs action(s) specified in TestSpec input file. Each is currently performed in sequential order. We need to implement a mechanism for the user to specify performing some actions in parallel, and proceed only after those identified actions are completed. For example, we may wish to run a traffic pattern for an hour, or for 100,000 transactions; meanwhile, we may wish to perform a different action such as running a script to restart a peer every 3 minutes until each peer has been restarted. Continue after both are finished.  Consider: we could require the "parallel" indication to be part of the TestSpec input file action descriptor. Or, it might be preferable for that knowledge/direction to be provided by the testdriver which calls the operator with a parameter telling it to run the actions from a testspec file together in parallel.  This issue blocks many complex test scenarios we have planned for the system test suite.     {color:#de350b}NOTE {color}(Dec 02): Azure should be able to run each it test in parallel, so we may not need to impement a test command option to do so. Instead, we may simply need to structure our tests to be able to run in parallel, and leverage the Azure capability to do so with our go tests.     ></description> </Issue>

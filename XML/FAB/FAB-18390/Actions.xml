CDATA  ~tock  It looks like the error is from:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/consensus/etcdraft/consenter.go#L171   Â   Could you clarify the meaning of the error and recommend a user friendly message so that users know what it means?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  It seems to me that this is coming from a 1.4.8 image, no?  i.e. `image: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:1.4.8` from the `orderer.yaml`  hence: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/51a3a52260f6228bdd57eb11cdf2a564c80c766d/orderer/consensus/etcdraft/consenter.go#L166  This message comes when a channel is created, but at a particular orderer O, that channel does not include O in its consenter set. In general that is not an error, as channels can be deployed on some orderers but not on others.  What is confusing is that the channel name here is `byfn-sys-channel` (the system channel) rather than `mychannel` (the channel the user is trying to add).   In any event, this image is before the system channel removal (2.3), so I speculate this is an error in the sample setup by the user... (I assume it is a sample because I see byfn). We have to look at the profiles used to generate the genesis block and the channel creation tx in order to know what went wrong.  As to rewording the error statement, I think that maybe this is more informative:  ``` errors.Errorf("the channel being created  %s  does not contain this consenter  %s  in its consenters set, the channel is added to the inactive chain registry for tracking", <channelID>, <consenter-id (to replace "me">) ```    ></body> </Action>

CDATA The ability to build fabric-ca-* images was removed from the fabric-ca repository. These images were being used when performing tests that used fabric-ca. These tests currently use the CLI, sdk-node, and sdk-java. In order to execute true interoperability tests to ensure consistency, these images are needed.   The fabric-ca sample has also been moved to fabric-test. There are a couple of scenarios that are only tested when this sample is executed. Until this sample has been transposed into proper tests for these particular cases, this sample should continue to exist as it has caught errors at times in the past. The sample can be removed when there is better test coverage for fabric-ca and fabric interoperability.  ></description> </Issue>

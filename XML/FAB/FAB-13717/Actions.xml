CDATA The CR contains the following changes: * fabric-ca sample that was removed from fabric-samples repo with the changes found in the CRs:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28141/ and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28139/ * fabric-ca-* Dockerfiles had to be modified to use alpine * includes all the new images that we have now and the ability to build the fabric-ca-* images to the Makefile and in a separate script * When starting chaincode, the version number and not "latest" env image is searched for - there is a bug open for this, in the meantime, the version (2.0.0) is tagged to the env images in the meantime * The new images that are now necessary such as baseos and nodeenv  This change does not enable executing the fabric-ca sample, but does allow the continued execution of behave tests including the interop tests.  ></body> </Action>

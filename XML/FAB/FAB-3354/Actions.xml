CDATA  ~Lin-YiTang  I agree with both fellas above. I am changing this to an improvement as there might be some improvement to documentation to help clarify things. However, please provide information what you changed exactly. For now will keep it under the doc category.  This is a really old issue and looks to be labeled properly at Alpha-1, as that is what what we had in April. Have you tried the more recent images and e2e? Beta was just released. Let us know if you are really having and issue still or we can close this out as there have been significant changes in the last 2+ months.  ></body> </Action>

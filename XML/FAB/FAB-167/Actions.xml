CDATA  ~AshishkumarLakshmanan  - the idea is to remove the transactional REST APIs from the peer nodes.  We do have the NodeSDK and there are proposals to create SDKs in other languages as well.  But I do believe that it is still valuable to have an "out of the box" REST implementation and the current thinking (at least mine) is that we can create a separate REST API server which uses the SDK under the covers  ></body> </Action>

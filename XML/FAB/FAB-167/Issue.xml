CDATA Hi,   I got to know from multiple slack channels that the REST interface hosted by the VP/NVP is going to be deprecated. My request is to retain it.  We are in Banking software business. And our goal is to use HL Fabric as the Blockchain framework to which different participants would be connected.  We defined a plugin which can talk as below  Banking App < == Plugin == > Fabric This way we were able to handle everything  1. Custom chaincode deployment  ( Go lang) ,  2. Invoke  3. Queries  Now if this REST interface is taken out, I don't know how to go about implementing these. In my opinion, REST is the best way to implement a decoupled interface. And this way any application would be able to connect to Fabric without much of a programming interface change on the Banking S/w end.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Needs Review:  fabric-amcl   - these headers are correct ... these files are from https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto ... you need to build your own distro so that's why we have our own repo for them and then this is vendored in multiple projects  No license found:  mocks / fakes - there are a number of files listed which have mock(s)/fake(s) in their path.  These are all generated by tools and there is currently no way to have those tools add headers.  Given we frequently need to regenerate these, I don't think it makes sense to add license headers to all of them.    ></body> </Action>

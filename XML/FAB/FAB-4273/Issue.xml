CDATA Nexus release location needs to have a directory per release.  Should platform be a subdirectory?  Keep bootstrap.sh as the download approach?  Or was this a short term placeholder for alpha2?  If we keep the bootstrap.sh approach, it needs to be versioned per release.  How about /release get-docker-images.sh and /examples/e2e_cli download-dockerimages.sh. We need to resolve/eliminate overlapping scripts.  ></description> </Issue>

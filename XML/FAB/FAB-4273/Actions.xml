CDATA   ~mastersingh24  you had some recommendations for the release artifact download approach, to improve upon the bootstrap.sh approach that I believe was a short-term solution for alpha2. Can you post your thoughts here.  We'll need to decide if a new and improved download approach makes sense for beta or if that needs to be pushed out to rc1.   ~ChristopherFerris   ></body> </Action>

CDATA See FAB-4267 for the (WIP) homebrew installer approach. What it wants is a compressed tar file with just the fabric native binaries for the darwin-amd64 architecture, currently with a name that matches the package naming pattern:  hyperledger-fabric-1.0.0.tar.gz  e.g.  bin/  bin/cryptogen  bin/configtxgen  I would prefer that we have a platform-specific directory under Nexus and add the version to the tar file name as above. I think we could write simple installer for Windows and that we could also write a trivial RPM and APT package as well.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Note that FAB-4267 is for packaging up the individual binaries.   This work item (FAB-4273) is intended to finalize nexus release location, directory structure, and download approach.  I see that bootstrap.sh is now versioned as of FAB-4325, so this aspect is looking better now.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When experimenting with Hyperledger Fabric, I encountered an issue with memory consumption. As is visible in the attached visualizations, the memory consumption of the container executing the peer process raises significantly when a batch of transactions (e.g. 200 TXs) is injected in the network (Figure 1). After a few minutes, memory seems to get freed (Figure 2). The problem seems to be caused by the peer process, as it has a huge RSS (Figure 3). When enabling pprof, the parts of the code consuming a lot of memory become clear (Figure 4). The problem is that, for subsequent batches, the memory consumption keeps increasing, slowing down the processing of transactions. As such, I am not able to use the framework for continuous operation. Can anyone tell me if this is a problem from my side or if this is how the code is expected to work?

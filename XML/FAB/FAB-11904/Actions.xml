CDATA When you instantiate on org2 peer, the chaincode fingerprint from org2 peer will be used on the channel.  For any peer with chaincode matching this fingerprint, chaincode can be invoked/queried.  Org 1 chaincode does not match this fingerprint, and therefore it cannot be invoked/queried later.  Just because org1 installed the wrong chaincode, we don't want to block the entire channel from instantiating/invoking the chaincode.  So I think this is working as designed.  ></body> </Action>

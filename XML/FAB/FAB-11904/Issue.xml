CDATA I created the following Setup:  2 Chaincodes - 1) a.go 2)a.go-mod (made a logical change in one invoke function in a.go)  I had 2 organisations, where I installed a.go on Org1 and a.go-mod on the other org (Org2) under the same chaincode name and chaincode version. The endorsement policy was set to the default, ie, Sign of any 1 organisation.  Firstly, the code successully instantiated, which I believe should not have happened. Second, even after this had happened, I ran an invoke on Org2, the invoke was successful, after which, when I queried all the ledgers, the Org1 ledgers gave me a data mismatch error and I couldn't perform any other activity (invoke or query) on them.  My concern is the second point. Even if in such a scenario, the chaincode setup does get instantiated (which it ideally shouldn't), I should not be able to commit a change on any of the ledgers because it leads to them becoming unsynchorinsed.  ></description> </Issue>

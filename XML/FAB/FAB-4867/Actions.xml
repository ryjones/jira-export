CDATA {code} # Gossip related configuration gossip: # Bootstrap set to initialize gossip with. # This is a list of peers that the peer reaches out to at startup. # Important: The endpoints here have to be endpoints of peers in the same # organization, because the peer would refuse connecting to these endpoints # unless they are in the same organization as the peer. bootstrap: 127.0.0.1:7051  # NOTE: orgLeader and useLeaderElection parameters are mutual exclusive # setting both to true would result in the termination of the peer, since this is undefined # state.  # Defines whenever peer will initialize dynamic algorithm for # "leader" selection, where leader is the peer to establish # connection with ordering service and use delivery protocol # to pull ledger blocks from ordering service useLeaderElection: false # Statically defines peer to be an organization "leader", # where this means that current peer will maintain connection # with ordering service and disseminate block across peers in # its own organization orgLeader: true  # ID of this instance endpoint: peer0 # Maximum count of blocks we store in memory {code}  The {{endpoint}} parameter missing port number, hence the failure during the startup as it fails to parse it. While this is clearly misconfiguration, I will add a patch which will provide meaningful error message and will handle it more gracefully.   ~reubent 1  ^^^  ></body> </Action>

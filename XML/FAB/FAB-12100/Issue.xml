CDATA The chaincode structs and operations that currently exist in the integration tests are structured to match the legacy lifecycle and chaincode operations. In the context of _lifecycle, chaincode packaging, installing, and instantiating each required a new struct for their parameters as the parameters do not match up between the legacy lifecycle and +lifecycle operations.  This task will be used to rename the legacy lifecycle (LSCC) operations in the integration tests once the new lifecycle is fully functional on the server.  ></description> </Issue>

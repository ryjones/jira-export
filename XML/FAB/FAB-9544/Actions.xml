We should also see if there are any other &quot;events&quot; we should propagate from lifecycle as well.  This approach also seems to have limited surface area in terms of the change, so I&apos;d be ok trying to add this as part of 1.2" created="2018-04-19 11:28:53.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2018-04-19 11:28:53.0"/>

CDATA {code:java} stub.SetEvent(UPGRADE, eventPayload){code} If we are to add the name of the chaincode inside some eventPayload, I think we might want to put it inside a protobuf message so it can be extendable in the future.... shall we add a new protobuf message to carry this?  Â Since we might make changes to the lifecycle I suggest it'll be a new proto message and not something that exists and might be either changed, or is already used for multiple stuff   ~C0rWin   ~mastersingh24  wdyt?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Today, "chaintool build/buildcar" command relies on ccenv/go-get to provide dependencies it relies on such as the chaincode shim.  Going forward, the peer side of the process should be locked down and not allow external network access.  Therefore, the proposal is as follows:  # "chaintool build" will continue to function as it does today.  That is, it will execute commands that will pull in external dependencies when necessary for the convenience of the chaincode developer.  This command is not used by the peer. # "chaintool package" will package up any dependencies necessary on a per-platform basis (e.g. go-list) and in a per-platform manner (e.g. go-vendor) # "chaintool buildcar" will assume that the .car file is completely self-contained and only use dependencies that are included in the .car package.  This will be the mode that the peer uses.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Although the old variable names will be deprecated, our tests should continue to work in 2.0 as is, (i.e. it is good that our scripts work as they are today, per FAB-17124). However, going forward, we should update our launcher scripts to use new names of two environment variables. Change:  ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISMETHOD to ORDERER_GENERAL_BOOTSTRAPMETHOD  ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE to ORDERER_GENERAL_BOOTSTRAPFILE  Refer also to:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/303   https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17116  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16477     ></description> </Issue>

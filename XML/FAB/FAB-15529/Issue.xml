CDATA The {{integration/nwo}} package contains the code necessary to bring up and manage a fabric network by integration tests. This package should not contain actual integration tests.  What should be included here are tests that demonstrate how to bring up a network.  With this in mind, the lifecycle tests need to move out. They belong in their own suite or in e2e.  /cc  ~wlahti   ~denyeart   ~ales   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are several things on this package that could use improvement on this package.  Off the top of my head as I'm writing this, I am noting down the following:  # Asymmetry on the return types; some functions return the logging level as the string type, others as the `logging.Level` type. # Functions whose purpose is unclear (`InitFromViper`), whose name is inaccurate (`SetLoggingFormat` does not just set the logging format), or whose logic is simply flawed (`InitFromViper` - pay attention to how the input argument is used). # Outdated and —in some cases— nonsensical comments on the exported functions.  This is my attempt to tidy things up. I've also updated the code that used to reference the now-deprecated methods.  ></description> </Issue>

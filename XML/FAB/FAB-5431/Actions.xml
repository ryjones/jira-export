CDATA FYI: Here is the modified check license script in the Go SDK ... as not having any license header in a merge could be annoying to cleanup after the fact.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/scripts/check_license.sh  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~troyronda , I've not been very successful pushing changes to this script in the past so I decided to try and attack this from another angle.  !https://jira.hyperledger.org/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png! But I think the approach you have in the Go SDK is good and I'd be happy with that.  Many of the fabric files didn't have any license and Chris is the one who fixed most of that so he knows quite well what a pain that is to fix.  I'll update my CR to adopt your approach.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

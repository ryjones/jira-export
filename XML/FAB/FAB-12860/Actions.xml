CDATA Just before we see the aforementioned logs indicating failures to create the 3 Consumer processes, we see logs showing we see an error which indicates the orderers are not ready. The other errors are logical consequences, not surprising (all 3 Producers got NACKs for all the msgs they tried to send to orderers).  Since this test passes every day, and other variations of this test passed on same day, we would have to troubleshoot this `consenter for this channel hasn't started yet` as an intermittent environment issue to determine what led to the failures to create the Consumers and to get the orderers up and running fully functional. Investigate if this occurs more often, or with a pattern, or coincides with failures with OTHER jobs (maybe at the SAME TIME, or on same machine, or some other common underlying factor).  {{ Creating Channels 1  34m2018-11-14 02:58:56.597 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 0m Endorser and orderer connections initialized Error: got unexpected status: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE -- will not enqueue, consenter for this channel hasn't started yet }}  ></body> </Action>

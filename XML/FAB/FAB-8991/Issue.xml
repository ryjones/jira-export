CDATA Today, chaincode install stores non-code related artifacts like instantiation policy and signatures.  Because chaincode (code) installation is a global operation, and because fabric v1.2 may have some channels operating in a v1.2 lifecycle mode, and some channels operating in a v1.1/v1.0 lifecycle mode, it's necessary to support both of them in the new peer binary.  However, going forward, there will need to be a new LSCC.InstallCode function which stores the new chaincode code package.  To minimize upgrade pain, it likely makes sense to have both of these functions store their data in the same way, so that users do not have to 'install' and 'installcode' the same chaincode bytes twice.  Still, going forward, perhaps in v1.3, the plain 'install' function should be removed entirely.  ></description> </Issue>

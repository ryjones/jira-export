CDATA This is similar to what I'm trying to do with FAB-665 and FAB-666 ? We have a tool that creates the genesis block and writes to a file.  I'm updating the orderer to then read that file, pull out and apply configuration items then write the block to the chain.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I haven't reviewed your changeset yet, but the genesis block tool gets certificate files and config parameters written in a file (I guess) as inputs, and outputs a block and the hash. (Let me know if my understanding is way off.)  What I'm looking for here is a function (not a script) that gets, a ConfigurationEnvelope (specifically, not certs and config files) as input and outputs a genesis block (as a data structure, in memory, no write-to-file) needed.  These look like two different things to me, but let me know if you think I'm wrong.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Right, I see the overlap now.  Please note that we'll need this function exported so that the broadcast code (https://gist.github.com/kchristidis/72b957547489e2331e8dbb346cb65a00#file-broadcast-go-L236) can call it.  It may also make sense to rename the function accordingly and/or modify your interfaces and/or move it to the orderer's common package.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA FAB-4207 added endorser filters to the peer to allow preprocessing of a transaction. The utility of these filters is limited by the fact that the peer must be recompiled with changes to the source code to add a custom filter.  We propose to extend this functionality by allowing a deployer to dynamically link an authentication or decoration filter at runtime. This will be done using plugins that are available since Go 1.8.  In addition to loading filters as plugins, this change set will also allow for chaining of static and dynamic authentication filters.   ></description> </Issue>

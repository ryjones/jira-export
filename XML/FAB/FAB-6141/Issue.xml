CDATA The original channel creation tx generation code assumes that no modifications have been made to the organization definitions in the ordering system channel.  For longer running systems this assumption may not hold.  Consequently, a new function which accepts the ordering system channel's config is required so that it can set the correct versions for the organization's in the channel creation transaction.  This CR adds this new function.  ></description> </Issue>

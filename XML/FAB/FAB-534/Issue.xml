CDATA When a customer has backups of the peer ledger (no need to do anything with couchdb database), can that backup database replace the original and continue with execution as needed? Stop a peer some time after a backup is made, copy the old ledger backup in to replace the newer one, and restart the peer.  Expected result: There should be no problems. Execution should continue as if it were the original ledger. Peer will resume, and catchup all blocks.  This can be added as a behave test for automation.  ></description> </Issue>

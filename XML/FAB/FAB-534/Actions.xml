CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris   ~latitiah    We are discussing this and will do some tests tomorrow. Question: Is the test intent to stop the peer first, before overwriting the existing ledger directory structure with the outdated backup copy?  Or should we leave the peer actively running when we do this? (This would be more of a "hot swap", but who would do that to a live system? is this a valid testcase?)  Also, we should be able to do the same test with an orderer in a kafka network.  ></body> </Action>

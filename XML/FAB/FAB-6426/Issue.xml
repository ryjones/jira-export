This field is rather redundant, because if it is not required, why is it in the map? Since we should not encode redundant information, and the ability to set this to false is likely to only cause confusion, it should be removed." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-10-03 19:39:07.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:14:34.0" resolutiondate="2017-10-04 14:37:12.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="40172"/>

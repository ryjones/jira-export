CDATA The new chaincode lifecycle brings with it a new packaging format.  The storage and retrieval of this format has been implemented in prior stories.  Now, it's necessary that both stores work, with the newer store taking preference.  There is an interface {{PackageProvider}} in the core/chaincode.  This would be a good place to start.  We need a shim which satisfies this interface and uses the chaincode stored in the newer store if it is present and in the older one if it is not.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~tkuhrt  the vendored docker dependency has LICENSE files but no code in those sub-directories. I suppose we could delete or maybe make a notice claiming that they are not applicable.  fabric-sdk-go is still a separate project, their JIRA is FABG project now. We don't include sdk-go, sdk-rest or sdk-py yet in the release.  I believe that the incorrect licenses, copy left have all been addressed (sdk-java CR   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/24725).      Could I please ask for another FOSSology scan to identify the correct list of missing license files (if any remain)? Thanks  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Notes for fabric scan 2018-07-27:  1) In the fabric repo, there are GPL-2.0 LICENSE text files in the github.com/docker/docker component, within the contrib/selinux-* subfolders. There is no corresponding code in these directories, so it appears there is nothing to which these GPL-2.0 files apply. Given that, I would recommend removing these directories and LICENSE files.  2) There is a .jar file in fabric-chaincode-java, at /gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar, which appears to contain compiled Java object code. This should be removed from the source code repo. If it is necessary for building then it should perhaps be pulled in as part of the build process, but the source code repos should not contain compiled object code.  3) There are four package.json files listed in the "Wrong license statement" tab. These files incorrectly state the project's license as "ISC"; these should say "Apache-2.0" instead.  4) There is also a file listed in the "Wrong license statement" tab in fabric-sdk-py at /hfc/fabric/channel/__init__.py. This file is missing most of the Apache-2.0 license notice (including any reference to Apache-2.0). It should be replaced with either the full standard Apache-2.0 license notice, or with an SPDX-License-Identifier as shown in #6 below.  5) The toml dependency is under the WTFPL license. toml has recently been updated to the MIT license (see https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml/blob/master/COPYING), which is a clearer and more broadly accepted license. toml was found at /vendor/github.com/BurntSushi/toml/ in fabric, fabric-chaincode-evm, and fabric-test (within /chaincodes/shim-vendored/plob-1.1-shim/chaincode/vendor.zip). Is it possible to upgrade these instances of toml to a newer version with the MIT license?  6) In the "No license found" tab of the spreadsheet, the files with "No license found" do not contain license notices that were detected from our scanning. Where reasonably possible, for those files that contain Hyperledger code, Apache-2.0 comments should be added. This can be done by adding a comment with an SPDX short-form identifier, such as:  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0  Note that the files in this tab listed as "third party directory", "excluded file extension" or "empty file" do not need to have these notices added.  Also, please note also that any "_sk" files also should have been marked in the report as "excluded file extension" and do not need to have license notices added. This will be fixed in future reports.  7) Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, CC-BY-4.0, is the license for Hyperledger documentation. Many of the documentation files already have CC-BY-4.0 notices. Consider adding notices to any Hyperledger documentation files that don't, such as by using an SPDX short-form identifier:  SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0  More information for #6 and #7 can be found on the Hyperledger wiki, at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/copyright-and-license-policy  ></body> </Action>

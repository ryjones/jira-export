CDATA This is by design in 1.4 and can be mitigated in 2.x.   From the  documentation|https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/private-data-arch.html#private-data-collection-definition : {quote} For example, in a channel with ten organizations, five of the organizations might be included in a private data collection distribution policy, but the endorsement policy might call for any three of the organizations in the channel to endorse a read/write transaction. For write-only transactions, organizations that are not members of the collection distribution policy but are included in the chaincode level endorsement policy may endorse transactions that write to the private data collection. If this is not desirable, utilize a collection level endorsementPolicy to restrict the set of allowed endorsers to the private data distribution policy members.{quote}  In Fabric 2.x you have a collection level endorsement policy: {quote}An optional endorsement policy to utilize for the collection that overrides the chaincode level endorsement policy. A collection level endorsement policy may be specified in the form of a signaturePolicy or may be a channelConfigPolicy reference to an existing policy from the channel configuration. The endorsementPolicy may be the same as the collection distribution policy, or may require fewer or additional organization peers.{quote}  ></body> </Action>

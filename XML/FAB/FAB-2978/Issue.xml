CDATA The Quality Team would like to begin scalability testing.  This require machines with public ip addresses.   The plan is to utilize docker swarm to cluster machines.  Is it possible for the fabric team to get either dedicated hardware or vm guests with ssh logins on public ip addresses?  Say 10 machines to start?  If this is possible, we can harden the details.  I am assigning to Ry.  Please ping me if you want to chat.  Thanks, Barry  ></description> </Issue>

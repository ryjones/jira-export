CDATA When there is no system channel, we should start a consenter without the  InactiveChanRegistry and associated go-routine.  This should happen also when the orderer starts without channels at all - we assume it is going to be a cluster-type consensus in this case.  This task mainly involves some refactoring of server/main.go and the etcdraft consenter.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Because of FAB-5309 and FAB-6080, channels which were created under the v1.0 channel framework had their config incorrectly initialized without the {{mod_policy}} on some elements being set.  The orderer has since been enhanced to enforce that the {{mod_policy}} is non-empty, but the existing channel configs are stuck in a state where they cannot be 'upgraded', because the {{mod_policy}} cannot be satisfied.  Although it is definitely a hack, we should modify these empty {{mod_policy}} fields to be defined to "Admins".  This implies custom upgrade processing of config, and violates the spirit of config updates with some 'magic', but this should be a one time hack to bring configuration into line so that we do not need to maintain some other 'magic' for coping with unset {{mod_policy}} which is otherwise disallowed.  ></description> </Issue>

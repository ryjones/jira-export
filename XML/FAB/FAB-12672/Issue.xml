CDATA In order to properly support leader failover during reconfiguration of the Raft cluster, Raft Chain, should be able to track leadership changes. Chain should introduce capability to trigger notification upon leader change to handle leader changes to take over and handle reconfiguration.   Currently chain receives channel via constructor such that external observer could be notified upon leader changes. However this channel could not be used internally for the purpose of taking care of failover.   Therefore there is a need to devise a method to track changes to being able to support leadership failover while re-configuring cluster.  ></description> </Issue>

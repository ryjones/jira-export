CDATA It seems the wait is meaningful only if some human is operating manually, in interactive mode. In scripts, its meaningless to make it wait and automatically supply the input. It should not prompt us to hit enter if we do not use the -t interactive flag. And (when using interactive mode) the prompt could be reworded to say “are you sure?” and ask for a "yes" (instead of a blank line Enter) to confirm such a significant command.  The current behavior (if you do not use -t flag) appears to be: on individual local desktop, I am told that it waits (even without using interactive flag) in the docker startup command in our IKS network, it does not wait  Can we make the behavior consistent for all environments? And make the prompts consistent with the behavior?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Noticed this in one of the builds: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/1582/console {code} 18:32:31     When an admin deploys chaincode at path "../../fabric-test/chaincodes/shimApiDriver/node" with args  ""  with name "myShimAPI" with language "NODE" # steps/endorser_impl.py:101 19:42:41 Build timed out (after 120 minutes). Marking the build as failed. {code}  Notice the time jump where the system seemed to freeze for 50 minutes before it timed out.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have updated the Makefile to reduce the time that it takes to clone fabric and fabric-ca repos (by only cloning a specific branch instead of the entire repo).  We can reduce the cloning of the submodule time by using {code} git submodule add --depth 1 -- repository path git submodule update --depth --  <path>...  {code}  Addressing the bdd test scenarios, there are some tests that can be removed if there are duplicate system integration tests that exist in the fabric repo.  Though the timeouts do not happen as often as they were at one time with the first change, once these 2 additional things are complete, it addressed the specific points laid out in the issue description.  ></body> </Action>

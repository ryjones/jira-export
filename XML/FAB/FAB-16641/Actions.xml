<Action id="65525" issue="42403" author="scottz" type="comment" body="This test has been completed. We are not planning to automate a test with 98MB transactions because of the resources required. Based on the explanation in the mentioned bug, it does not affect external behavior; just that a block was delivered a 2nd time because of the way kafka works.

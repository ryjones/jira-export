CDATA As mentioned in the #FAB-16068 comments by  ~scottz , create a new test case FAB-16720 to automate a test in kafka (and raft) based networks with out modifying the existing orderer config parameters (besides AbsoluteMaxBytes). This task will be used to execute and debug the testcase with max payload (nearly 100 MB), but not automation.  Refer also to the  Hyperledger Fabric wiki page for Quality Assurance ( https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Quality+Assurance%3A+Tests%2C+Strategy%2C+Reports%2C+Diskspace+Requirements ) for discussion of relevant config parameters useful for processing huge transactions: refer to section "Handling Large Transactions"  ></description> </Issue>

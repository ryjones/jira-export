CDATA Does this mean a generated mock?  Â   Why? The existing hand-rolled mock appears to have all functionality needed for a very simple client.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="59670" issue="39016" author="btl5037" type="comment" body="Very simple is using the actual docker interface, from the actual docker client Fabric currently uses, to auto generate a mock. That leaves us with 5 lines of code we would have to maintain. That&apos;s about as simple as it gets. This is a remnant of a bygone era, before we had counterfeiter and mockery. We need to standardize and cleanup the codebase. We now have tools to generate the mock that didn&apos;t exist in Fabric when it was written, and we should be using them. Just because something works, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s the best way. It&apos;s ugly, unclean, and requires maintaining. This is part of our hygiene tasks intended to cleanup the polluted codebase." created="2019-05-02 00:17:07.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2019-05-02 00:17:07.0"/>

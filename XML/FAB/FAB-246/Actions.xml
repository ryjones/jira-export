CDATA The GitHub repository was transferred to Gerrit, and we left things frozen on GitHub to allow for pull requests and issues to be transferred. It is likely that you had a mismatched version of the software from the documentation. The documentation  1  and the GitHub source  2   and the DockerHub images  3  have been re-aligned, and you'll notice that we've updated the port assignments. Please try the current documentation as it carries the correct port assignments.   1  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  2  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric  3  https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledger/  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="71509" issue="46618" author="btl5037" type="comment" body="The `peer node pause` and `peer node reset` and `peer node rollback` commands are performed offline, the `peer node pause` command creates a lockfile that prevents the peer interacting on a channel until `peer node resume` is run. So you must execute the `peer node pause` command as part of the launch command in the container before the `peer node start` command is executed. So you will need to stop the `peer` running inside of the container and then execute your commands. Or modify your docker command to run the `peer node pause` command before calling `peer node start`." created="2021-03-09 18:58:46.0" updateauthor="btl5037" updated="2021-03-09 18:58:46.0"/>

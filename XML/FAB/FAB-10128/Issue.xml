CDATA +*Setup:*+  Network Topology: 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, each peer with CouchDB container for stateDB, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels.  Run1: Test aggressive endorsement-time push to all peers (maxPeerCount equal to number of peers)  Run 2:  Test no push and only pull at validation/commit time (maxPeerCount of 0 ensures no pushing)  Client Driver: PTE +*Test Steps:*+ 1) chaincode: each channel has one chancode, marbles02_private go chaincode, instantiated 2) 100000 transactions transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 25000 queries concurrently with tx id from 1 to 25000           thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2 3) Concurrently, do  100000 transactions (repeats): 2 a) 100000 rich-queries of 4-field spread among 2 channels.  b)  100000 private data queries on specific committer peers.  +*Result:*+ 1)hardware setup 2) RPS (request per second) achieved for queries 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers and CouchDB containers  ></description> </Issue>

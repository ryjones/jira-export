CDATA  ~Honglei  Project teams have found that the table metaphor did not map well over key-value database.  Instead of a implementing a series of patches on top of an imperfect metaphor, it was decided to not support table api in v1 and instead encourage projects to model data as JSON and persist the exact composite keys that they need for their requirements.  New chaincode APIs CreateCompositeKey() and PartialCompositeKeyQuery() have been implemented to assist chaincode developers with querying based on a subset of keys, to fulfill their query requirements in a more controllable manner.

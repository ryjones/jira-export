Your mark has some potential. IMHO, the typeface choices not so much.  so i had my team take a different approach. instead of only doing Fabric...I had them come up with a system that could be applied to other projects (e.g. Sawtooth, Composer, Burrow, etc.) that exist as well as be extended to future ones.   For example, you'll see we tweaked the HP logo to fit within the style of the logos. Sawtooth and Composer logos were also added to cite examples of how they can work together as a projects under Hyperledger. Happy to work with HP Marketing on this more closely if desired.   I've attached the two best idea explorations we came up with for consideration.  1) Hyperledger Logos for Presentation.pdf 2) Hyperledger_branding ideas.pdf   ~ChristopherFerris  happy to take one idea and explore it further (along with any requested tweaks). We'll leave it up to the community and you on how you would like to proceed.   Cheers  ></body> </Action>

CDATA just a quick word on process and timing. It looks like Fabric 1.0 is coming soon, so we'd love to get all logo proposals in by Monday 7/10.   we would ask that all interested parties register their preference and that the community favorite be put forward to the marketing committee - I am  the proxy, so once the community preference is put forward, I will share it with the Marketing Committee Chair and we will ratify it as the logo or come back to the group with suggested changes. As long as the design adheres to the guidelines, we will do our absolute best to defer to the preferences of the community.  thanks!  ></body> </Action>

Love what you've got on page 5 in branding_ideas_v2  One small point is that the words "Hyperledger" and " Project Name " below it should be aligned with one another left.  One question - the Fabric and Composer logos look to have very similar visual styles, which may convey the notion that Composer is for Fabric. Clearly Fabric is the first supported framework, and my understanding is that the plan of intent is for Composer to work with other Hyperledger framewkrs. Given this long term plan, I wonder if having a little more differentiation in the style would be valuable?  In the interest of getting started with the Hyperledger Fabric logo, if you can make the small edit regarding the alignment of Hyperledger and Fabric and get that over to me in the requested formats, I'll begin using it on the web site and elsewhere.  Thanks and look forward to your and others' thoughts on the Composer logo question.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~gtewallace   We'll send a revision with tightening up the alignment.   What we set out to do was create a logo system so that other projects could align and unite under the Hyperledger brand- both now and in the future. We even went so far as tweaking the Hyperledger logo so that it would align better. But all of this was intentional.   The previous  PDF|https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/attachment/10976/Hyperledger_branding%20ideas%20lowerRes.pdf  showed preliminary ideas on what that could look like with Fabric, Sawtooth, Composer, etc. The system can evolve and grow, but we think it would set a good tone if implemented. For the latest round we simplified and just showed Fabric and Composer, which our teams both contribute to.   The complaint in the past that I've heard directly is that the projects don't align or look like part of a larger umbrella.I realize this is subjective, but the proposed design system looked to solve that. A united system would allow Composer to convey that you could pair it with Fabric, but other frameworks as well in the future.   Alternatively, if you wanted to have distinct logos, taking the composer logo from Hyperledger Logos For Presentation3.pdf might make more sense.   Thanks again  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Now I see, thanks for the explanation.  My sense is that for now, a good step in the right direction is for all the projects to use the guidelines to create their logo.   Since the guidelines ask for all logos to include "Hyperledger" and the project name in the same proportions, I do think this should get us on the path towards a more unified identity across the umbrella and constituent projects.  Realistically, I don't see us going from the current state of nearly no project logos to a fully integrated system in one fell swoop. I do sincerely appreciate the thought, skill and effort that have gone into these PDFs.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~seanbarclay   getting caught up here after I was on PTO last week.  I think I should be looking at Hyperledger_branding ideas_v2.pdf - is that right?  Assuming yes, then I think it's looking great. My only question has to do with the first page with the Hyperledger logos. Are these suggestions to replace the current logo? If so, then I would ask that we break these out into a separate file. At present there is no active process underway to rework the Hyperledger organization logo. Should the Marketing Committee determine that this is something it would like to pursue (and any member is totally empowered to advocate for this), then by all means these logos could be submitted as part of that process.  thank you!

CDATA  ~gtewallace  correct you should be looking at Hyperledger_branding ideas_v2.pdf, posted on 7/17/17. We did include a Hyperledger Project logo update in that PDF to reflect how it could be consistent with a Fabric and Composer logo to create cohesion and unity. Generally, from a branding perspective, you want to achieve that, but I can respect that the Hyperledger project doesn't want to go that route. Again, it's a suggestion to be considered.   I see that the logos have been put up for an election. If selected, we'll be happy to provide the final files in whatever formats you need. Thanks again  ></body> </Action>

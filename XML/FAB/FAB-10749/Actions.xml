CDATA All release jobs are ready to publish images and binaries for 1.2.0  *Docker Images:*  release jobs pull 1.2.0-stable docker images from nexus and re-tag it as 1.2.0 and publish to hyperledger docker hub. This is a manual trigger from Jenkins. (No need to create a tag in the repository to publish images)  *Binaries:*  release jobs to download fabric and fabric-ca binaries from nexus and re-tar it with 1.2.0 release version.

CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris   ~denyeart  I think we have to publish images based on the release commit  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23421/  to match both "fabric.version" and "RepoTags". Otherwise the fabric.version (1.2.0) and repotags (1.2.0-rc1) shows different versions if we use images or binaries which are published already without the above patchset.  ></body> </Action>

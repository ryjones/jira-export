CDATA  ~muralisr  My best guess is that this was created when we were trying to map out a rough plan, w/o a concrete understanding of the steps involved.  In an earlier edit, I suggested that we mark this as done (i.e. close it), however do we have a means to address the following: a configuration transaction that requires endorsement/signatures from more than one orgs? If we don't, this JIRA is relevant.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kchristidis   ~muralisr  I don't think this item belongs to Endorser, which doesn't have the orderer's MSP signers that might require in some config.  At this point, I think it should be an out of band process, like signing of a chaincode package. We need a standalone tool or CLI to do this.  ></body> </Action>

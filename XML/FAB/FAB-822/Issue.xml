CDATA Since the InsertRow operation does not prevent the length of a string (or bytes) type column's value being zero.  Suppose there is a table looks like this:  tableName: MyTable || _ROW-DEFINITION_ || string, key=true || int, key=false || | _ROW-VALUE_ | "" | 47 |  table key: 7MyTable row key: 7MyTable0  The DeleteTable operation just delete rows searched by RangeStateQuery(tableKey + "1", tableKey + ":"). So the row {"", 47} won't be deleted.  Similarly, the GetRows operation won't get some rows contain empty strings.    ></description> </Issue>

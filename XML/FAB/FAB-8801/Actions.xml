CDATA Discovery Service NodeSDK: - add new role to connection profile channel peers attributes to indicate a 'discovery' peer      -- by default a peer added to the channel will be a discovery peer allowing for non connection profile based configurations - add an internal method to discover channel configuration, members, and chaincode endorsement selection plans. (low level internal API)      -- the method will be to convert grpc to NodeSDK usable objects and references. - update the channel 'initialize()' method to take a parameters to indicate the target peer and whether to use discovery      -- default will be to use discover along with the peer's query for instantiated chaincodes (I assume this is not a admin only call ) to get a picture of this channel      -- if no target is specified the first discovery peer assigned to the channel will be used      -- save the msp, peers, orderers, and chaincode endorsement selection plans. - update the sendTransactionProposal to allow for a plugin to select the targets and sending - create discovery endorsement handling plugin      -- determine the target list as suggested by  Yacov             -- allow for application to provide good and bad lists (passed as send request attributes)             -- pick random to complete (give priority to higher ledger counts)     ** no new API's  ></body> </Action>

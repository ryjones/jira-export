CDATA I think that for v1.0 we should encourage users *not to change ordering service endpoints at all* because of the following scenario: * Assuming we have a peer *p* in orgA * the ordering service endpoint are all replaced to a totally new set and *p* is updated with the new endpoints * Later, peer *q* in orgB is added to the channel, and it's the first peer from this org, and it is given the genesis block that points to an old, non existent set of ordering service nodes (they were all replaced)  * Unless *q* has connectivity to *p* or any other peer from orgA - it will never be able to connect to any ordering service endpoint at all. * The reason is that we currently update the delivery client as configuration blocks are consumed, and there is no way to "override" the delivery client to work with an ordering service that is different from the latest configuration block. * This whole scenario gets even impossible to solve if: ** orgA was the first org in the channel ** orgC was added later to the channel ** orgA was evicted from the channel later ** orgB was added last, and now cannot even communicate with peers from orgA.\ ** as a result - orgB is disconnected from the channel although it participates in it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~yacovm  While I see your point and I think it's perfectly valid, since changing endpoints might be quite dangerous action, _however_ you missing the fact that this possibility is  already there and in order to take effect peer has to be restarted.  So you scenario could be done even now, with one except, you need to restart your peer once config is updated.  ></body> </Action>

I was just chiming in to say that we should recommend users not to mess with that part of the system anyway, since it is very easy to shoot oneself in the foot. Therefore - I'm not certain how urgent it is to fix this for V1.0  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't think we should make any changes in this area for now.  We can put this in a fix pack.  I would document this as a known limitation.  I don't see that anyone will have the need to actually do this in any case for the first few months.  So my vote is defer to first patch release  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As we saw in FAB-8415 , certificate expirations are a major disruption, regardless of whether it happens in production, tests, or samples.  We are at risk of other certificate expirations over the life span of 1.1 (let's say next two years).  Need to review all certificates and update any that will expire within the next two years, across these repositories: fabric fabric-ca fabric-baseimage fabric-chaincode-node fabric-samples fabric-sdk-java fabric-sdk-node fabric-test fabric-test-resources  Longer term we need a better strategy for managing certificates in the repositories.  ></description> </Issue>

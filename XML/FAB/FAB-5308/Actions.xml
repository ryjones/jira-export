<Action id="28655" issue="19247" author="nickgaski" type="comment" body="Is the goal here to update the consortium on the system channel or simply to add an org to an existing application channel? My initial understanding was that since channels exist in the purview of a consortium, then the actual consortium would have to be updated on the system level.  However, Jason has explained that this is fact not the case.  You can still add an org to an application channel without updating the consortium at large. " created="2017-07-19 13:15:46.0" updateauthor="nickgaski" updated="2017-07-19 13:16:25.0"/>

CDATA Understanding Consortium Usage - As per my understanding, only those organization added to the consortium, has authority to create channel. I have changed the e2e to add only Org1 however channel creation fails upon using the Org1 admin MSP.

The caveat is that you cannot do this on channel create; you must do a channel update after the the channel has initially been created." created="2019-08-11 09:21:55.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2019-08-11 09:21:55.0"/>

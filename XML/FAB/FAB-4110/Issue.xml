CDATA For cases where there isn't a load balancer in front of the peer or orderer nodes, the application should be writtten in such a way to handle individual failures.  Specifically:     1 - Retry orderers and peers on error.  2 - Cycle through the available peers and orderers if one of them is unreachable or if the operation doesn't complete.     This will cover the case where one instance is having a problem, but others work.  We should provide best practices in the documentation we build for helping people write chaincode apps that covers HA.  ></description> </Issue>

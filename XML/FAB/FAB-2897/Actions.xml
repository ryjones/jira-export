<Action id="21765" issue="15471" author="manish-sethi" type="comment" body="Block number has a significance because, it is stored in the block&apos;s header and is exposed via public APIs (&apos;GetBlockByNumber&apos; etc.) and hence the preference was to match the block numbering to bitcoin numbering scheme. As far as transaction numbering is concerned, as such there is no notion of transaction number and hence no public APIs. It&apos;s all in the internal code. So, pretty much it is a matter of taste and hence either way is fine. No, I don&apos;t foresee any issue with this." created="2017-03-31 08:41:59.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2017-03-31 08:41:59.0"/>

CDATA When an MSP identity is validated, its validity can be cached until an event does require the MSP to be updated. Before that, if the a validation is requested again on the same identity, the result stored in the cache can be return directly.  The same reasoning can be applied to MSP identity deserialisation and to MSP principals.   ~Senthil1 , ~elli-androulaki , ~ales , ~yacovm , ~mastersingh24 , please have your say,  ></description> </Issue>

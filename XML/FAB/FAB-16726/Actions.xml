<Action id="64233" issue="42540" author="scottz" type="comment" body="The job has executed fully through all the behave tests, for the last two days, so it appears the strange problem has disappeared. And the pass/fail results are consistent for the past two days as well (20 failures out of 136 tests). IÂ would normally recommend opening specific bugs for the remaining specific test failures - however we will be deprecating the behave tests soon anyways and shutting down most of these 1.4 tests due to aging/incompatible tools that have not kept up with fabric changes. For now, we will just monitor for steady results in the behave 1.4 test suite." created="2019-10-01 15:20:06.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-10-01 15:20:06.0"/>

CDATA > My assumption was when I update the MSP definition on system channel, they get propagated to the channels that have the MSP and they are kept in sync.  Indeed, this would be very nice behavior, and is something we've discussed implementing via something like an "Identity Channel".  However, it is nothing that is implemented today and this is working as designed.  > (Workaround is to update ALL the channels using private key that was used in the original definition. But this is not practical since you might have a lot of channels and you also need to have the private key of the cert that was originally on the channel)  Agreed that this is tedious, but I don't know that it's necessarily completely impractical.  Changes to MSP definitions should be relatively rare, and there are alternatives like the OU principal type that can be use instead of the Role.Admin type if frequent changes are foreseen.  ></body> </Action>

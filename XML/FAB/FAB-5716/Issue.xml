CDATA # Create a channel say, 'mychannel' using "Org1" # Add a new admincert (admincertB) to the consortium on system channel for "Org1" # Use the private key for adminCertB to instantiate chaincode on 'mychannel'  This fails because mychannel isn't aware pf adminCertB even thought I updated the MSP definition for Org1 in system channel.  My assumption was when I update the MSP definition on system channel, they get propagated to the channels that have the MSP and they are kept in sync.  (Workaround is to update ALL the channels using private key that was used in the original definition. But this is not practical since you might have a lot of channels and you also need to have the private key of the cert that was originally on the channel)  ></description> </Issue>

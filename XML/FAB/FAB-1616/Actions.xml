CDATA About https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3901/ this patch, I hope we could discuss here. In short, the code of same logic including download chaincode and make a tar file in different packages (golang/java/car) is not consistent. In car package they are in package.go, but in hash.go in golang and java package. Also now the hash method is not used in car package.   So above two points I want to fix For first, I feel package.go is more suitable. For second, I think it should also need invoke hash method.   ~muralisr  ~ghaskins  ~harrijk  ~hgabre  ~satheeshk   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="20527" issue="14030" author="muralisr" type="comment" body=" ~grapebaba  I agree consistency would be good. One thing to note is that the hashcode for a chaincode package could be coming back (as an additional check... we will NOT go back to using the hashcode as a name). https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1783 has some details on how hashcode will be used. Something to consider as part of this work." created="2017-01-23 12:59:04.0" updateauthor="muralisr" updated="2017-01-23 12:59:04.0"/>

I am moving the Dockerfile injection to the endorser side of the processing so that the CLI/SDKs no longer need to provide it.  I have noted that the package generation is a bit of a mess.  Perhaps we need a design spec." created="2017-01-23 13:24:58.0" updateauthor="greg.haskins" updated="2017-01-23 13:24:58.0"/>

CDATA Now that our LTS strategy states we will not backport breaking changes to prior releases, we will stop performing automated daily tests on branches prior to our current master.  We should disable the daily/weekly test suites for these branches by removing the CRON entry in the pipeline definition files. This does not include nightly publishing jobs.  I'll note that a user can simply navigate to Azure DevOp's to trigger the tests should the need arise.  This will allow us to focus efforts towards ongoing and future work, rather than monitoring old releases and backporting changes.  Acceptance criteria: No nightly tests execute on branches outside of master.  ></description> </Issue>

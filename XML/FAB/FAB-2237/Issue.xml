CDATA This query should provide the names of all the channels a given peer has joined.  The query can be called from CLI as follows:   {code} peer chaincode invoke -C testchainid -n cscc -c '{"Args": "GetChannels" }' {code}  The query will return a ChannelQueryResponse proto with the following definition: {code} // ChannelQueryResponse returns information about each channel that pertains // to a query in lccc.go, such as GetChannels (returns all channels for a // given peer) message ChannelQueryResponse { repeated ChannelInfo channels = 1; }  // ChannelInfo contains general information about channels message ChannelInfo { string channel_id = 1; } {code}  Once this is done, this will need to be exposed on the SDK.   ></description> </Issue>

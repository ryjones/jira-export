CDATA When a collection configuration is supplied to a deploy/upgrade invocation, the LSCC logic should attempt to instantiate the policy. Instantiating it will perform extra semantic validation and will - for instance - ensure that no SignedBy node references the ordinal of a principal out of the range of the supplied ones.  The extra validation will be added to endorsement phase, so it is unnecessary to use a new capability.        ></description> </Issue>

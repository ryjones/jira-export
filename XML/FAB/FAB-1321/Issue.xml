CDATA This epic consists of all the work needed to implement the default MSP supported by the fabric.   MSP enables the fabric to support multiple roots of trust, among other things.  This, includes two major components:   - one sitting on the node/peer/orderer side, that does plain X.509 certificate parsing, and associated signature generation/verification,   - one sitting on the client (application) side that registeres/enrolls users, generates transaction certificates, incorporates attributes in transaction certificates and is used to perform tcert signature verification/generation.   Note, that MSP implementation should consider the BCCSP of the peer/orderer/client code the MSP is running on.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Something's going on in the gRPC layer, between the broadcasting client and the orderer (gRPC server).  Quickly glancing at the code, and it looks like "the client preface is not valid." I defer to  ~mastersingh24  who's handling the server component. Any idea what we're seeing here?  Question to  ~Ratnakar : What happens if you have another client attempting to Broadcast after you see this? Does it go through?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Not sure if Gari will chime in here, but via Rocket.Chat: {noformat} it usually means that one side is not using TLS{noformat} Are you using your modified `broadcast_timestamp` client for this?  Something's up with the configuration there?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kchristidis   I am not using *broadcast_timestamp* client for this. I am using *e2e_cli* sample hence *CLI container* is the client here.  when (3rd orderer) *Orderer2* is started along with rest of the orderers (Orderer0 and Orderer1) I couldn't see the issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kchristidis  Apologies, It is my bad. when Orderer2 is started TLS is disabled.  It is due to the environment variable configuration, where *ENABLE_TLS* is empty hence *TLS* is not enabled. {panel} - ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED=$\{ENABLE_TLS} {panel}  ></body> </Action>

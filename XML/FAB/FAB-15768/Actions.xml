<Action id="62898" issue="40705" author="wlahti" type="comment" body="Ah, I think I know what the problem was. I&apos;m guessing you generated the artifacts for byfn without specifying a channel id, so it was defaulting to &quot;mychannel&quot; at that point. Then, when starting up the network and specifying the channel id, it was trying to create &quot;testchannel&quot; using artifacts that referenced &quot;mychannel&quot;. " created="2019-08-14 15:42:38.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2019-08-14 15:42:38.0"/>

We should make sure to document that the generate step should also be run with the -c channel id flag before attempting to bring up a network with a non-default channel id. " created="2019-08-14 15:45:32.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2019-08-14 15:45:32.0"/>

CDATA Dear Will,   Thank you and I am glad you are able to replicate the issue and also identify the underling issue. I believe you may be accurate on why this has happened. I encountered this issue as I was trying to perform channel configuration updates dynamically  with configtxn txn .      Hence your analysis makes perfect sense.      I agree with your resolution suggestion. Another option would be - to at least alert the user - why this happened and how to recover rather than state the fact and fail. For example - the message could have been - MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE SAME -c option when you generate the artifacts and when you use them to start the network  -generate and -up .     Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

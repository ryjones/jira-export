CDATA The channel configuration values are currently mutable, which causes problems.  Each sub-group of configuration data commits seprately, leading to potentially inconsistent views of the channel configuration when considered in the context of cross go-routine out of execution for memory assignment.  This CR adds the channel config values to the immutable config bundle and introduces a poor man's config value parser.  This parser will be removed once the config values are entirely immutable, but is convenient for now to remove an unwanted dependency on the configtx code.  ></description> </Issue>

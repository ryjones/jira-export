CDATA The current configtx code was written under the assumption that it was managing a channel configuration.  Although there is some abstraction via the use of interfaces to make unit testing easier, it's not currently possible to use the configtx processing for something like the RSCC support.  This story is to remove the channel config specifics from the configtx package, and to factor the common components out of the channel config package into a common config package.  ></description> </Issue>

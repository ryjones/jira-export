CDATA Refer to  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1  and the New Feature JIRA mentioned in the summary.  Previously, all applications needed to capture information of the target fabric environment. The FAB-5363 enhancement generates a common exchange doc, with backend topology information. With this doc the application will no longer need to construct the channel, add peers, orderers and get the org admin, simplifying your application development.  ></description> </Issue>

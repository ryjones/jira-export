CDATA The MSP claims "CA Certificate did not have the Subject Key Identifier extension, (SN: %s)" whenever a certificate does not have an SKI set _or_ when the certificate does not have the "IsCA" attribute set.  In the latter case, it is very confusing to the user because when they inspect the certificate the SKI will indeed be present while the error indicates otherwise.  Additionally, the error prints the cert serial number as decimal, which is very unhelpful because most tools display it in hex.  ></description> </Issue>

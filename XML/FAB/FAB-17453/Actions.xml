CDATA The error is caused by function InitCrypto called by function  common.InitCmd, which is a hook function of cobra.Command(chaincodeCmd), in file internal/peer/lifecycle/chaincode/chaincode.go. I thought of two ways to eliminate the effect of this function.  The first method is to separate the "package" command from other commands, such as install, queryinstalled, approvedformyorg, etc. Define a new cobra.Command variable to register "package" command, instead of the variable chaincodeCmd, and the new variable does not register function common.InitCmd as a hook function.  And the second method is to modify function common.InitCmd. If the function is called by commod "peer lifecycle chaincode package", skip function InitCrypto.   I think the second modification method is simpler and I prefer it.   ></body> </Action>

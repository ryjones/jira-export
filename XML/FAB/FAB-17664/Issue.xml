CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to be able to retrieve and update my channel's policies.   We initially supported adding/removing/retrieving policies for all other groups except for the channel group, lets add this in now before we support retrieving the entire channel config.     *Acceptance*  I can call a function to add a policy to the channel group and another to remove a policy from the channel group. I should also be able to retrieve the existing policies in the channel group. The examples should be updated to demonstrate usage of these features.  ></description> </Issue>

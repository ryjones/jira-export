CDATA The documentation for the chaincode interface for {{GetState}} reads as follows:  {noformat} // GetState returns the value of the specified `key` from the // ledger. Note that GetState doesn't read data from the writeset, which // has not been committed to the ledger. In other words, GetState doesn't // consider data modified by PutState that has not been committed. GetState(key string) (  byte, error) {noformat}  As a first time chaincode developer, it's not at all clear what the behavior of this function will be when the key does not exist, and whether this is an error or not.  ></description> </Issue>

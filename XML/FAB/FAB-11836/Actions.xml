There are a few items related to logging, including this, that need to be looked into now that we&apos;re using the new zap logging package as our backend for most of Fabric (everything other than chaincode containers, as far as I know).

CDATA > Think it makes sense to have both SetModuleLevel and SetModuleLevels exposed via the admin service?  No. I think we need to avoid adding operations.  The current service is already weird with extra cruft like GetStatus and StartServer (that only return a constant ServerStatus_STARTED) and adding different mechanisms to change the logging level is just additional complexity that is unwarranted with drags to proto, service, tests, etc.  We should just fix the current issue and move on.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/26140/  This is the first step in re-enabling set log levels via regular expressions. There is further planned work to address FAB-11775, which points out that the log levels at peer startup no longer function as expected.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA In some cases, peers in the same organization should communicate by connecting to endpoints only route-able from within the organization, and when communication with peers in different organizations, they should connect to endpoints that are route-able from outside the organization.  We need to add to gossip the ability to do that.  My plan is to add another endpoint, and to have the signature over a GossipMessage that contains an AliveMessage to be signed over a message that contains the internal endpoint as nil, and then the peer signs the GossipMessage it'll add the internal endpoint and the signature over the internal endpoint and then send the message.  When a peer forwards a GossipMessage that contains an alive message to a different peer outside of its organization, it'll delete the inner endpoint's ip address.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Add methods to validate a config update in broadcast phase.  Validate a proposed config update versus the current config.  This the code that was removed from the Bundle.ValidateNew().  Checks the validity of the state transitions of a possible migration config update tx by comparing the current ConsensusType config with the next (proposed) ConsensusType fields. It is called during the broadcast phase and never changes the status of the underlying chain.  ></description> </Issue>

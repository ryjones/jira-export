CDATA Define configuration for peer builder/launcher plugin roots in {{core.yaml}}. The configuration should be a list of directories. The order of the directories specifies the order in which the {{detect}} portion of the protocol will be executed.  Example: {code} chaincode: external_builders: - some/filepath/one # should contain some/filepath/one/bin/detect - some/filepath/two # should contain some/filepath/two/bin/detect {code}  When relative paths are used, they are treated as relative to the directory containing {{core.yaml}} instead of the current working directory. This is consistent with other configuration data.  ></description> </Issue>

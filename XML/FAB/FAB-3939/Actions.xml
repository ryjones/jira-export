CDATA  ~ptippett  The query I was thinking was   {code:java} peer chaincode query -n cscc -c '{"Args": "GetChannels" }' {code}  or the equivalent from SDK. Once the peer is up this will get all the channels the peer is attached to and would have to be issued by a MSP.member of the peer. This will cut through a large part of endorser side code in addition getting you the information on channels that are on the peer.  ></body> </Action>

It is a requested improvement. I am sorely tempted to change this to an Improvement.  ~ptippett  please help me understand why this should be treated as highest priority defect when it will necessarily involve API changes, and likely changes to core code, at this late date." created="2017-05-30 16:46:42.0" updateauthor="christopherferris" updated="2017-05-30 16:46:42.0"/>

CDATA Murali and I talked about this and one option was to query some system chaincode that lists channels.  If that call returns and better yet, if it returns a list of channels, that might be good enough.     Murali.  Can you provide details in this issue?  If that works, we can likely lower the severity of this.  Thanks!  ></environment> <description><! CDATA In order to support hyperledger in a production environment, especially when hosting many networks for other users, we need a way to easily tell if a peer is healthy.  Simply checking if the process is running isn't enough, and looking at the logs is great for debugging a single network, but doesn't scale when trying to support many networks in a production environment.  A simple, low impact, CLI or grpc call that verified that returned status indicating whether or not a peer was healthy, or a simple check we could do on a network we were hosting for other users (so didn't require us to submit transactions) would suffice.  ></description> </Issue>

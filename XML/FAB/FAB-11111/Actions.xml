CDATA can we have a update on the delivery of this utility. Preference would be to make it as a part of fabric-tool docker image.  Â   Today, we do package fabric-tool on pre-prod and production system and making it as part of the fabric-tool would not allow us to change deployment deliverable. Having all tools (others already present configtxlator, fabric-ca-client) and now like the said would be 1-stop solution for fabric.  ></body> </Action>

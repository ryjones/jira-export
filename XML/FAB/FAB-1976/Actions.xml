CDATA  ~muralisr Two problems 1.Refer to https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/711, protogen still not support 1.7 context 2.If we have interface in *pb.go and use context as a arg, the implementation cannot use 1.7 context too.  ></body> </Action>

To summarize, ** we wanted to move to using "context" package instead of "golang.org/x/net/context" and remove "vendor/golang.org/x/net/context" ** however protogen does not support "context" yet per  ~grapebaba  investigation ** some files in fabric are already using "context" while majority use "golang.org/x/net/context"  We have two options # leave things as they are with a mixture of "context" and "golang.org/x/net/context" # make sure all packages use "golang.org/x/net/context" in fabric till we can move to "context" wholesale  If both packages can coexist, there's no reason to reverse any changes.    ~grapebaba  do you know of any reason they should not coexist ?    ~binhn   ~ChristopherFerris   ~greg.haskins   ~mastersingh24    ></body> </Action>

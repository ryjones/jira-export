CDATA The chaincode test tool should take an optional argument defining the detail of logging to be provided. The default for this should be "info" with an option of "debug" provided also.  Debug should provide more in depth detail about the processes running and info should give a top level view to keep the user posted of where the tool is.  Error output should always be shown no matter the log level.  Logs should include cucumber step output and network setup output.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA self-note: In _core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go_ function _LoadCommittedVersions_, it obtains a newVersionCache and assigns to *VersionedDB* every time the function is being called.  However, this function is being called by multiple code paths, which resulted in complex synchronization.   - detach *committedDataCache* from *VersionedDB* struct, and create a simple API to return the committedDataCache. - refactor higher level synchronization code when it is not needed anymore.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This Epic controls the release of Fabric 1.0.x. We use it to drive and link to all of the stories, bugs, improvements included in a release, and all of the tasks necessary to deliver it.  The maintainers will hold a daily review of the underlying JIRA items and make a determination as to whether or not they should go into the pending release by setting the _Fix Version/s_ accordingly.

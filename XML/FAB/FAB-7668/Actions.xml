<Action id="38325" issue="26679" author="divyank" type="comment" body="A possible solution to this would be to store some system chaincode metadata on the ledger (like we do for user chaincode). This would help all peers have a standard view of what system chaincodes are running. This could be part of the channel config or there could be an instantiate step for system chaincodes like we have for user chaincodes. In the latter case, we could also have a set of &quot;required&quot; system chaincodes (like LSCC) that don&apos;t need instantiation as we can assume presence on all peers." created="2018-01-09 03:47:09.0" updateauthor="divyank" updated="2018-01-09 03:47:09.0"/>

If people decide to use their own system chaincode, they must be responsible for distributing the proper peer binaries and/or plugins to all participants." created="2018-01-20 23:53:13.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2018-01-20 23:53:13.0"/>

CDATA How to conduct channel membership changes is a frequently asked question.  The tools are all there, and there is some fragmented documentation around this, but the best way to document is through example.  It should be relatively straghtforward to enhance one of the examples to define three application organizations instead of 2, then create a channel with two members, and add the third.  This is an exercise that I've gone though by hand and would be happy to walk the implementer through.  ></description> </Issue>

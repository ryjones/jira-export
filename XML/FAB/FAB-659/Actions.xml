CDATA There is a minor change to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1823/1/sdk/node/src/hfc.ts in debug logging which is under review.  Will keep track of this and ensure it gets into the fabric-sdk-node in function newInvokeOrQueryTransaction, lines 1996 (...level to CONFIDENTIAL) and 1999 (...level to PUBLIC).  I do not see any other open changes that need to be merged.  ></body> </Action>

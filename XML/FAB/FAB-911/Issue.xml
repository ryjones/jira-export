CDATA Transactions that are sent to vp0 are lost. Some other scenarios, and other peers, do not exhibit the problem.  Found in v0.6 testing. Similar to FAB-333 and FAB-335, but not same.  CAT_407_S0S1S2_D_I_R0R1_IQ.go Scenario: Bring up a 4 peer network with security using example02. Stop peers vp0 vp1 vp2. 100 Invokes to vp3. Deploy new instance of chaincode, to vp3. a=b=10000 Wait over 6 minutes. Start peers vp0 vp1. Invokes:  77 to vp0,  2 to vp1,  8 to vp3. Query:  EXPECTED A/B:      9813     10187. ACTUALs: Peer 0             9890     10110 Peer 1             9890     10110 Peer 3             9890     10110  Those 77 invokes sent to vp0 were lost. In future we can enhance test case to check for event notification to confirm whether or not the fabric knew they were being dropped, but nevertheless it seems odd that only those that were sent to vp0 were dropped.   ></description> </Issue>

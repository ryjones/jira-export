CDATA These validations _could_ be added on the peer side in the chaincode handler HandlePutStateMetadata(). However, the feature was designed generically so that the validation parameter could be anything, not just a MSPID policy, so it's not as simple as just adding the validations. We'll need to consider whether to extend the shim API to indicate that the validation parameter is based on MSPID policy, or perhaps give the shim access to things like channel members so that the shim could add such validations.  Since this would be new functionality, changing from Bug to Story.  ></body> </Action>

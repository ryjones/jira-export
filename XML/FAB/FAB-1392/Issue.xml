This way proposalHash can be computed over each of the two byte arrays as opposed to the serialization of common.Header. This is required because at transaction time, the headers are split in two (ActionHeader has a SignatureHeader and the Transaction has a ChainHeader) and the two need to be assembled before computing the hash. If protobuf serialization is not deterministic, then we might have a problem when reconstructing the proposalHash" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2016-12-14 14:47:38.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:54:15.0" resolutiondate="2017-02-23 18:32:27.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="36885"/>

CDATA Put latest stable images in Nexus. Provide a label or tag (something like "DEV_STABLE" that always points to "the latest working images" (from the master development branches of the repositories).  Every day, the fabric-test daily test suite pulls the latest commit levels and runs integrations tests for several fabric repositories. When it passes, then automatically upload all the working images, npm modules, etc, into Nexus and reassign the "DEV_STABLE" tag to point to them.  Anyone can use the tag to pull the latest stable images for their own development and testing.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There are a lot of questions on how to add additional organizations and peers to an existing organization, especially to the BYFN (which would be more difficult since there is some predone cert work already). So we need an example / clarity on how to add peers to an existing organization.  This should feed off a doc, potentially the same doc as adding an additional organization to a running fabric network.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~jiangyaoguo  Thanks for creating this. Agree that having chaincodeID in ChaincodeAction is has some interesting possibilities. If we are ever going to use just one ChaincodeAction then the duplication is not that valuable (but no harm done) On the other hand it opens up the possibilty of multiple chaincodes per TX.  Also, even with a single Chaincode we can check if ChaincodeAction.ChaincodeID.Name == ChaincodeHeaderExtension.ChaincodeID.Name   ~binhn   ~mastersingh24   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi,     I followed the following steps:  I define 3 Organisations in the config.tx and one channel profile in which consortium contains only 2 organisations.     I generated the artifacts and started the services on docker.  I created the channel and run the join command for the 2 organisation peers which were part of the consortium.     But when I tried to join the 3rd organisation peer, the command for the joins runs successfully and I can see the channel in the peer channel list.     So I think it not be able to Join the channel if it is not a part of the consortium.     In the peer logs of 3rd organisation I can see this:  ERRO 03b  korechain  Got error &\{FORBIDDEN}     And in the orderer logs:  Principal deserialization failure (MSP Org3MSP is unknown) for identity 0  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I think we need to tighten the relationships a bit more. e.g. to pair better with the code and make things more intuitive, perhaps we show how the CreateCar function in the Smart Contract was triggered- and how that led to the car on the right being Audi, Q7, Red, Sarah.   Aesthetically, the car just feels like it doesn't belong visually with the rest. The ledger being dimensional also doesn't feel consistent.   ></body> </Action>

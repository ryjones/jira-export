CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to verify that a cert was issued by my organization's MSP before adding it to the MSP's revocation list.  Acceptance: Provided with a config block/transaction, I can call a function to "revoke" a certificate issued by an MSP. This should result in a configuration update that appropriately modifies the {{revocation_list}} attribute of {{FabricMSPConfig}}.  Providing a certificate that has not been issued by the MSP should result in an error.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA All components, please link to this issue as a blocker for v1.1 features/fixes which are not backwards compatible with v1.0.x, but which do not affect the transaction validation path.  For example,  enabling mutual TLS authentication for chaincodes|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5406  will cause existing chaincodes to fail to start and will require that the chaincode is redeployed.  However, this simply prevents an endorsement, and has no possibility of forking the world state.  These issues should only be merged after consideration for an existing v1.0 migration path.  Issues may be closed, but establishing the link will enable us to document the incompatibilities as v1.1 releases.  ></description> </Issue>

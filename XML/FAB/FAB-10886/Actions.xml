CDATA Fabric v1.1. fabric samples version? IDK about the version but I ran git log and this is the last commit:      commit f05a132586ae9ca7ce86b9e56ae4bd3b084bc959 Author: foolcage <5533061@qq.com> Date:   Sun Apr 8 18:03:01 2018 +0800      -FAB-9406- Typo in byfn.sh          I found "depete" in first-network/byfn.sh.     Maybe it should be "delete".      So it's not a very old version I suppose.        ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't think this is an issue .... I think the artifact in the repository was generated by an older version of configtxgen (v1.0.2) and there have been multiple changes since then.   ~jyellick  - I don't think this is an issue?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I dug through the code and it looks like configtxgen set the txid in the ChannelHeader back in 1.0.x but hasn't since then.   release-1.0 code:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.0/common/configtx/template.go#L276   Also verified that inspecting a newly generated channel.tx contains an empty tx_id in the channel header: {code:java} "channel_header": { "channel_id": "mychannel", "epoch": "0", "timestamp": "2018-06-28T18:57:33.000Z", "tx_id": "", "type": 2, "version": 0 }{code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Although {{configtxgen}} used to set the txid, this was an error and is inappropriate.  The txid is computed as a function of the creator and nonce.  Since configtxgen deliberately does not perform actions with a crypto context, there is no creator, and there is no nonce, so setting a txid does not make sense.  When the channel creation transaction is actually sent to ordering, the submitter may (and usually should) set the txid of the transaction before submitting.  ></body> </Action>

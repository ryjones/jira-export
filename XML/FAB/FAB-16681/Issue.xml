CDATA In the "Enrolling the admin user" section ( https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html ) there is a note that says:   _"You may find it useful to stream the CA logs when running the upcoming programs by opening a new terminal shell and running `docker logs -f_  _ca.example.com`_|http://ca.example.com/ "  However, after launching the network with the {{`./startFabric.sh javascript}}` command there is no  _ca.example.com_|http://ca.example.com/  container therefore the command fails. There are, however, two CAs: _ca_peerOrg1_ and _ca_peerOrg2_. After checking the source code of _enrollAdmin.js_ you can see that it uses:  _ca.org1.example.com_|http://ca.org1.example.com/  which corresponds to _ca_peerOrg1_ according to the _first-network/docker-compose-ca.yaml_ file.So the actual command to inspect the logs is `docker logs -f ca_peerOrg1`  Â   Also, in the "Querying the ledger" section ( https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html#querying-the-ledger ) there are some references to the _../../basic-network/connection.json_ file when in reality the code references _../../first-network/connection-org1.json_ as you can see in f_abcar/javascript/query.js_  ></description> </Issue>

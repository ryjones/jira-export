CDATA When instantiating with the binary utility and the option to add a collections config file (which works fine using the Node SDK):    bin/peer chaincode instantiate --collections-config myfile.json  ...    The error is:   Error: invalid collection configuration in file myfile.json: could not parse the collection configuration: json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field collectionConfigJson.policy of type string   Because of this line:    https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/eca1b14b7e3453a5d32296af79cc7bad10c7673b/peer/chaincode/common.go#L157    Instead of a string, it should be a JSON object type, thus the error being unable to parse it.       ----       EDIT:     The file used for the collections at instantiation is different when used from the SDK or the command line, as the policies need to be formated as JSON or polish notation, respectively.     This is not a bug, but should be added to the documentation.  ></description> </Issue>

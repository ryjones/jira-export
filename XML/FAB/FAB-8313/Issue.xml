CDATA When gossip selects K peers out of the total candidates, it performs the filter predicate over all of them and then selects a random subset of size K (if possible).  It might be problematic in case the membership view is very large.  It will be much more efficient to first randomize the order of all peers, and then iterate and select the first K that match the predicate.   ></description> </Issue>

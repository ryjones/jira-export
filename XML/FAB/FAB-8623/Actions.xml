CDATA Docker multiarch should fix this issue. The work what I did here  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/18467/  will resolve this issue.  ~ChristopherFerris   ~mastersingh24  Do you suggest any other approach to fix this issue?  Once the docker multiarch is ready, I will give 1.1-latest in fabric-ca docker-compose file, which always pull the latest tag of 1.1 release.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As noted in the Release retrospective, I really want to move us past the process we currently have. I would like to get to a place where we have:  A) nightly builds that publish images and binaries to Nexus  B) integration and SVT tests run against a matched set of images and binaries - maybe we tag with a specific tag for our testing (e.g. tag "candidate" or something).  C) when we are happy with the results, we can retag with a release identifier and publish the lot to the respective homes (docker hub, maven etc)  D) lather, rinse and repeat  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sambhavdutt   ~jtclark  Existing Verify jobs publish docker images and binaries for every patchset and we have a daily jobs which publishes docker images with "latest" tag to nexus repository. We are trying to implement the same in merge jobs and publish every image & binary with "candidate" tag to pull them in downstream jobs. # fabric-test-daily cron job should pull these "candidate" images & binaries to test. # Every SDK (fabric-sdk-node, fabric-sdk-java, fabric-samples) jobs should pull these images & binaries instead of building them.  Few pain points here:  We can not publish binaries with the same tag. In this case, we can only publish "candidate" tag only once through Jenkins maven:deploy-file plugin. We should identify a way to publish unique binaries to nexus2 repo.  ></body> </Action>

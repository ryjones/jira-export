CDATA As a Fabric client developer, there are useful utilities in protoutil that I would like to use in my application.  With the protos being externalized into fabric-protos-go, it would be beneficial to also externalize protoutil (e.g., into fabric-lib-go).  Context: we had a downstream developer of the SDK ask about usage of proto utils. https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=hDpwE7YPvr4Hbf4Q6  The Fabric Go SDK, itself, maintains an internal copy of the utilities (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protoutil). It is preferable to stop needing to copy from Fabric and instead be able to make usage of common components.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The network was brought up using byfn with 1.1 capabilities enabled, two config updates are made by fetching the latest config block from orderer system channel (testchainid), first change is increasing the max message count in batch size from 10 to 20 and second change is increasing the max message count in batch size from 10 to 50. The final pb files of both the changes are send to the orderer at the same time using orderer admin.   No error message is seen on the cli side but only one config update happens and the other one is discarded by the orderer.  The config update that is queued first passes successfully and the second one fails as a result only one new config block gets written on the orderer system channel.    ></description> </Issue>

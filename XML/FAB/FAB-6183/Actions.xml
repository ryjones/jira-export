As discussed, create multiple targets in Makefile which should clone fabric, fabric-ca etc.. repositories then build docker images and binaries before execute fabric smoke, release and daily tests from fabric-test repository. This approach gives more flexibility to install/update packages or tests as per developer wish in fabric-test repository. CI team, just execute &quot;make ci-smoke&quot; or &quot;make ci-daily&quot; etc.. from Jenkins job. Let me know if you have any concerns or any questions." created="2017-10-09 14:00:57.0" updateauthor="rameshthoomu" updated="2017-10-09 14:00:57.0"/>

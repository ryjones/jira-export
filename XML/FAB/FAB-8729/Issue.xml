CDATA Fabric currently has the concept of ESCC and VSCC and theoretically one can associate different ESCCs/VSCCs with chaincode on a per channel basis.  In practice, this is not the case as the validation "flow" is actually "hard-wired" and there is really no definition / interface defined for implementing "custom" ESCC/VSCC.  Ideally we should be able to easily add built-in ESCCs/VSCCs to Fabric and also allow ESCC/VSCC to be built as plugins.

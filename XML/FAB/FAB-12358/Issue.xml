CDATA To prevent dragging bunch of unnecessary complexity, the healthcheck should be implemented as a basic http or https endpoint at /healthz. When the peer is healthy, it will return with a status of `HTTP 200/OK` and JSON payload of '  {"status": "OK"}  '. If the peer is responsive to the status check, but unhealthy, it will return with a status of `HTTP 503/Service Unavailable` and a JSON message that indicates which subsystem has failed the health check.  ></description> </Issue>

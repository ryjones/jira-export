CDATA We have chaincode that can take 2 minutes for the INIT to run and it fails with some strange errors {quote} Error:  80914958 No ledger context for GetState. Sending ERROR {quote} from Rocketchat:  {quote} theres a timeout of 30 secs. I think you are running into the situation where the requester cleaned up the context and returned error back. When the chaincode called GetState, the context was no longer there (and you get the above error). We need to remove the hardcoded timeout and allow timeout to be specified via a property. {quote}   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As an infrastructure developer I want o be able to define and leverage multiple MSPs (or roots of trust) on the same channel  This item relates for the fabric infrastructure to support multiple MSPs within the same deployment. This includes - ability to define / configure multiple verifier MSPs in the genesis of a channel - ability to leverage these MSPs for defining access policies for chain/chaincode rights - ability to re-configure verifier MSPs in a secure/modular way within a channel  The work described here relates to the design associated to multi-MSP support from an access control perspective, but also of chain reconfiguration as well as the implementation of the respective components.   ></description> </Issue>

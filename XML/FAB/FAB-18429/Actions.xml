CDATA Hello, we are developing Blockchain Verifier at Hyperledger Labs ( https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-verifier ), and this use case seems to have much in common with the tool, so we think it can be expanded to support this use case.  We'd appreciate if you could give us any opinion.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~shimos   We prefer to build the utility in fabric repo so that all the ledger utility code is available. It avoids limitations like what you mentioned about verifier ("the plugin uses only the first file({{blockfile_000000").}}  The first story will be FAB-18425.  Could you explain what the blockchain verifier actually checks in the fabric-block plugin?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  Thank you for the comment. I agree that the disparity between the implementation of the platform and that of the tool could be some concern.   Blockchain Verifier is designed not to rely on internal functions of platforms, and so there are several issues as you pointed out since some functions that SDK does not provide are implemented by Blockahin Verifier.  But this allows explicit checks for blocks, rather than implicit checks inside a library.   Currently it checks  - The hash value in the header of a block and the hash value calculated for the actual block  - The previous hash value in the header and the hash value calculated for the previous block  - The signatures for the block by orderers  - The signatures in the endorsements   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Today, the orderer may be given one of two genesis methods 'Provisional' or 'File'.  In the 'Provisional' case (useful only for testing) the orderer generates a genesis block based on a configtx.yaml file, while in the 'File' case, the orderer loads a file from the filesystem.  In order to ultimately allow the orderer to start without chains defined, we need to allow a genesis method which does not attempt to do anything.  This genesis method should be called 'None', and should not trigger loading of the genesis file, nor generation of a genesis block.  ----  If you supply None as the genesis method for an orderer that has not been bootstrapped, the orderer should panic. If you supply None as the genesis method for an orderer that has already been bootstrapped and the genesis file is not available, it should start normally.   ></description> </Issue>

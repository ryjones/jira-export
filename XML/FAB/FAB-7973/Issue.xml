CDATA We currently vendor an old version of viper with several "quirks". An example can be found in FAB-6803.  The upgrade is complicated by the fact that all keys (not just top level keys) are now treated as case insensitive. This breaks assumptions in the viperutil code used by peer, chaincode, orderer, and configtxgen.  ></description> </Issue>

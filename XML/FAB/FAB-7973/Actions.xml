In 95% of the places where we use configuration, the configuration values are static and can be memoized. While memoization out of a constructor can work, ideally we move to exported attributes on the structs that need configuration (caller provides the config), configuration options (caller provides config as named, optional values), or configuration objects." created="2018-10-01 19:54:27.0" updateauthor="sykesm" updated="2018-10-01 19:54:27.0"/>

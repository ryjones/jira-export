CDATA When a peer determines whether a given peer is eligible for receiving blocks for some channel, it looks up the latest state info message that the remote peer has sent.  In some situations, especially at boot time - the peer might get a message for that channel (i.e a hello message for blocks pulling) from that remote peer before it has received a stateInfo message from that peer. This results in a printing of a warning that a peer attempted to pull blocks but wasn't eligible for the channel.  This warning is a false negative and disappears after a while when the peer receives the StateInfo message of the remote peer.   ></description> </Issue>

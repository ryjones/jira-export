CDATA One (of several) aspects of Hyperledger Fabric that I find very 'opaque' (and thus confusing) is uncovering the definitive "environment" necessary for peer commands.   The documentation enumerates *only* flags for e.g. peer commands but IIUC flags are one dimension, extensive (undocumented?) sets of (mandatory|optional) environment variables are expected; and in some cases there's an expectation of a configuration file.   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/commands/peercommand.html   E.g. per documentation:  {{CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP" CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crtexport CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel}}{{peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME -f ./channel-artifacts/channel.tx --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem}}      I've been unable to find documentation for each of the commands that explains|enumerates the complete environment. My approach has been to start with known-working fabric samples e.g. first-network and attempt to evolve these.  This approach is challenging and results in a hope (!) that the result is correct rather than an assurance.  Recommend:  Provide definitive documentation of the environment (mandatory and optional) including explanations for the configuration not just enumerations (please).     ></description> </Issue>

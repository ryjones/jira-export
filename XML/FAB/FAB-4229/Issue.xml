CDATA Test Name: -FAB-4229-, performance benchmark: long run - mix  Component: Performance  Description: Performance 12 hr mix long run      chaincode: each channel has one chaincode, sample_cc, instantiated      transactions: 8 threads, each thread sends 1 invoke followed by a query per second to the anchor peer of an org of each channel for 12 hours as the following: # thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1 # thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1 # thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2 # thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2 # thread 5 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1 # thread 6 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1 # thread 7 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2 # thread 8 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2      Each invoke has payload size of 1kb-2kb.  Artifact Location: crypto-config  Network Topology: docker containers; 2 channels, 2 organizations, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, with TLS enabled  Client Driver: PTE  Input: ./pte_driver.sh userInputs/runCases-chan-longrun-i.txt  Output: # The benchmark passes if it  completes without any error. # The benchmark fails if it encounters error or does not complete, or any query fails.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When protobuf definitions are updated in {{fabric-protos}}, an automated build process should be triggered to compile the protos to go and commit the generated artifacts to a separate source repository that gets used by or vendored into consumers. The {{fabric-protos}} repository will not contain the generated language bindings.  We have a couple of options to discuss for placement:  1. Create a {{fabric-protos-go}} repository to contain the compiled protocol buffer bindings for go. In this scenario, the import paths for the various protobuf packages would be {{github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/ common,discover,peer,orderer,etc }}. This repo should be configured not to accept pull requests. The contents should be managed by automation.(Preferred.) -2. Reuse the {{fabric-lib-go}} repository. In this scenario, the import paths would all be under a common {{protos}} folder and would be {{github.com/hyperledger/fabric-lib-go/protos}}.-  In either case, pull request builds for {{fabric-protos}} should generate but *not* merge/commit the artifacts to the target repo. Builds performed post-commit should generate the artifacts and commit them to the target repo.  Update: During IPM we decided to do the build and promote with Travis-CI.   1:  Please consider branching strategies. {{fabric-protos/release-2.0}} should promote to {{fabric-protos-go/release-2.0}} while {{fabric-protos/master}} should promote to {{fabric-protos-go/master}}.  2:  Please read https://medium.com/namely-labs/how-we-build-grpc-services-at-namely-52a3ae9e7c35 for inspriation.    ></description> </Issue>

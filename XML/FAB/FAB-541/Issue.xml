CDATA The last line of the Dockerfile is currently like this:  # install the hfc locally for use by the application RUN npm install $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node  This means the version of HFC can get out of sync with what the application developers are told to use, namely the version published in npm.  Also the publishing of this image could be lagging behind the publishing of HFC in npm, resulting in errors seen with the starter kit that have already been fixed in npm.  Should really switch to "RUN npm install hfc"  ></description> </Issue>

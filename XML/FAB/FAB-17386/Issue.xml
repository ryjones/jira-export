CDATA The chaincode test tool should provide step definitions for the new chaincode lifecycle to start a chaincode running on a channel. The step should be language agnostic and should use the CLI argument to work out which language to instantiate the chaincode.  The chaincode folder locations should be gathered from the CLI where the directory is given which supplies all the chaincode and includes the overriding of a specific chaincode location  Example: Have folder containing most of the required chaincodes for the tool in /Users/andrewhurt/testChaincode Have chaincode "advanced" in seperate location and can specify in CLI that specific location  ></description> </Issue>

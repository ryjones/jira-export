CDATA As an SRE I want to be able to reset the logging level for components in an Orderer to the initial value (as at end of start up) in a similar way to how I can reset the level for components on a Peer using the {code:java} peer logging revertLevels{code} command. The values should be reset without having to restart the Orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

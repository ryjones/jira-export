CDATA lccc currently supports "deploy" in its Invoke method.  lccc needs to be modified to implement an "upgrade" function which will * check for existence of chaincode (upgrade will error out if chaincode does not exist) * replace the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec * bump the version * return the new version of the chaincode  Note that the actual starting of the chaincode is done in the endorser outside of the lccc and is outside the scope of this task.  ></description> </Issue>

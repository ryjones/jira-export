CDATA With the initial version of the integration tests, the tests are coded to have each peer endorse the "ApproveChaincodeDefinitionForMyOrg" step, even though this should be not required.   This task will be used to ensure that we only approve the chaincode definition once per org in the integration tests and then check that the block has been gossiped to the other peers.   ></description> </Issue>

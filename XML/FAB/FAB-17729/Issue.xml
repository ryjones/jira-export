CDATA We should address the general logging statements in BCCSP pkcs11. Many of them add no value (or are essentially trace level statement) to someone debugging their HSM configuration.  For example:Â  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/bccsp/pkcs11/pkcs11.go#L87   We are logging the happy and expected path in the code. We should look at the happy paths and add logging statements to the error path, so users can better understand when things arent going well, but aren't inundated with messages when things are going well (gossip causes this message to be logged hundreds of times a minute depending on your gossip settings)  ></description> </Issue>

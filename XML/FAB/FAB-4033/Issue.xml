CDATA end-to-end.rst recently added guidance for developers to *checkout v1.0.0-alpha2* when doing e2e trials.  The intent was to avoid any potential problems in latest master.  However this advise has backfired, as the instructions and docker-compose in fact had problems at that alpha2 tag level.  After discussing with maintainers, it was agreed that the checkout v1.0.0-alpha2 guidance should therefore be removed.  Also, in a follow-on work item end-to-end.rst may be removed in favor of Getting Started.  Or perhaps refactored with obvious paths for 'consumers' (who download images) vs 'developers' (who clone repositories and make docker images).  ></description> </Issue>

Because, chaincode execution is a proposal to update the ledger, it does not actually update the ledger and therefore the writes are not available for query.  Also, this will not be available for couch, and therefore we need to be consistent across state databases.  For the sake of consistency and simplicity, I would like to remove RYW semantics from &apos;GetKey&apos; API." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2016-11-23 09:20:06.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:10:53.0" resolutiondate="2017-01-19 16:28:46.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="36748"/>

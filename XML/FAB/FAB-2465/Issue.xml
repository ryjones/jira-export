CDATA As a fabric application developer, I want the ability to deploy user chaincode in pre-built form so that each member organizations' peers do not need to build the UCC (nor need to have the source code on the peer).  Note: the controls on allowing organizations to examine the source code or build their own images is separate from the deployment issue. i.e., each channel and member organization can still make a decision on whether to deploy the UCC without requiring the source code to be built and available to the fabric peer itself.  Sufficient pre-built targets will need to be provided to handle the possible environments of a fabric network.  ></description> </Issue>

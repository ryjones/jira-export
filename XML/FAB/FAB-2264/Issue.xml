CDATA Currently chaincode handler will return 100 items to the chaincode container, even if the chaincode ends up not exhausting the list.  All 100 items will go into the RWSet phantom check results though, even though the chaincode client didnt read them.  This should be improved such that only the items that are actually read go on the RWSet phantom check results.  This can be deferred from v1.  ></description> </Issue>

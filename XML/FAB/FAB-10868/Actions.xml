CDATA I assume that applications development is meant to be a shorter term for client application development. May I assume that there are two input available: 1. The associated smart contract and 2.

CDATA Excuse me  Ed that I missed the above message.  I believe Fabric is slowly growing up and that means that Fabric needs more customers. Customers want to see how a problem they have, can be solved with Fabric. Therefore we are developing the Applications Development topic by starting to describe the business, illustrated with concrete examples and scenarios, understandable to business and Fabric experts. Btw a technical question: I saw version 28 while there was no answer to 27. How do I see what 28 adds to 27? Please be aware that I am very weak in that software.  ></body> </Action>

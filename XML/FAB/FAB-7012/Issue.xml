CDATA The following error message is received when there is a certificate that has been tagged as a CA certificate. While one should be able to use "A CA certificate cannot be used directly by this MSP", the error is clearer if it were to say "A CA-tagged certificate cannot be used directly by this MSP"  It would also help to know exactly what certificate the complaint is about, since there are potentially multiple certificates on the system.  {code} 2017-11-16 16:42:57.709 UTC  orderer/multichain  newLedgerResources -> CRIT 078 Error creating configtx manager and handlers: Setting up the MSP manager failed, err admin 0 is invalid, validation error Could not obtain certification chain, err A CA certificate cannot be used directly by this MSP panic: Error creating configtx manager and handlers: Setting up the MSP manager failed, err admin 0 is invalid, validation error Could not obtain certification chain, err A CA certificate cannot be used directly by this MSP {code}  ></description> </Issue>

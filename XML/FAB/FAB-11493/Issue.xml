CDATA Hello-  The High throughput tutorial's README is very buggy/leaves a lot for the user to infer that can make it difficult to setup the network.  I would like to update the documentation, as well as update the chaincode slightly in order to allow traditional 'standard' assets to be deleted from the network, since currently there is no way to do so.       This pertains to the 'release-1.1' branch of the repository.  I understand the latest is v1.2, however a lot of the clients i work with still prefer 1.1 so it is worthwhile to update this documentation.     I have attached the new chaincode which includes the updates.  All it is is a simple `delstandard` function, that works in tandem with `putstandard()` and `getstandard()` in order to facilitate deleting something on the network if it is put on using the traditional way.  ></description> </Issue>

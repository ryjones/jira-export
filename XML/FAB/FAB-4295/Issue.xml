CDATA These days I get in touch with FAB and try to do some stress test.  It seemed BDD tests is a good start point.  But I found the documents for Behave BDD tests look deprecated for that I have to install Virtual Box and Vagrant as dependencies.  But since the environment itself is a ubuntu Xenial in VM. Installing Virtual Box process hangs permanent. It is reasonable that install VM into VM is problematic.  Thus our group switch to write our own stress test program for runnable new FAB in Docker.  And is there any plan to provide official stress test template/scripts on new FAB?  Â   ></description> </Issue>

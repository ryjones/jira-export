CDATA David, yes, please look in the test/ folder in the fabric repo.  Also, for running behave, there is no longer a dependency on Vagrant. There are install instructions in a README in bddtests/ folder and there's a script for initializing the behave dependencies under scripts/ .  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Just to share my discovery: \{\{}} {code:java} source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh{code} would not work when my python version is 3.x, it will say: {code:java} /home/davidliu/.pyenv/versions/3.6.1/bin/python: Error while finding module specification for 'virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'virtualenvwrapper') virtualenvwrapper.sh: There was a problem running the initialization hooks.  If Python could not import the module virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader, check that virtualenvwrapper has been installed for VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/home/davidliu/.pyenv/shims/python and that PATH is set properly.  {code}  Then I found that it is not about python2 or python3. Problem comes from the 'pyenv' version manger.      ></body> </Action>

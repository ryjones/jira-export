CDATA The deliver service has a backoff and retry policy that makes the deliver service reconnect to the orderer upon a connection failure, until a threshold has been reached.  The total time of reconnections is currently hardcoded by  reConnectTotalTimeThreshold|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/core/deliverservice/deliveryclient.go#L32  and is set to 5 minutes which is too low for some use cases where the ordering service in unavailable for a long duration of time.  We perhaps need to make it configurable in core.yaml   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Storing data on a blockchain is often in contradiction to basic GDPR requirements, which require a user/client/participant to be able to request deletion of their data.  In Fabric, private data partly addresses this issue, as it allows to only store hashes of the actual transaction read/write set on the ledger and keep the actual data in SideDB. However, the control over how long this data is kept is limited (BlockToLive)Â and there is no facility to delete specific private data on request from all stores (TransientDB, SideDB, WriteSet Cache).  The goal of this epic is to address this issue and allow targeted deletion of private data from all caches/stores, including from internal db log files as mentioned in FAB-15536.  ></description> </Issue>

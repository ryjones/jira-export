CDATA PTE install of Chaincode is unable to create the indexes in the CouchDB.   how to reproduce:  with PTE, install and instantiate a chaincode (make sure that peers have CouchDB as stateDB and the Chaincode has the necessary index definitions in the specified folder)  Result: The CouchDB does not have the indexes defined, as seen by looking through the CouchDB web interface  Browse to `localhost:5984/utils/#/_all_dbs` click on the database named `<channel_name><chaincode_name>` click on the `design docs`   expected: indexes are defined and are present as design docs  ></description> </Issue>

This was necessary before recent changes, to allow the application to manage certs and keys in a custom manner. This is no longer required, as the SDK performs this management in the SDK stores. Application can obtain user&apos;s key and cert by calling IdentityManager.GetSigningIdentity(). So we don&apos;t need Enroll and Reenroll to return the key and the cert any more." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-03-01 02:40:12.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:15:54.0" resolutiondate="2018-03-01 14:54:16.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="41412"/>

CDATA Revised the raft start sequence after consensus-type migration, such that: * Remove the redundant checks and tests.Â Simply check to see if the consensus metadata field is nil in the block (as the block writer nils this field on migration), indicating that the chain must have been migrated. * Eliminate the DetectConsensusMigration method that was added to the consenter API.  ></description> </Issue>

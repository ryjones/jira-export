CDATA It looks like the context is wired down to {{deliverBlocks}} and is selected on so f the client connection goes away, things will be cleaned up. If the client simply closes its envelope stream, the server will continue to run until the stop height is reached. This is working as designed.  Closing the client stream simply means the client has nothing more to send but it must continue to receive until the server stream is closed. Based on the information you've provided, your first (and only) request is for all blocks until until the end of time.  Basically, the deliver service does not pipeline requests; it simply handles them sequentially.  If I've misunderstood anything about your scenario, please let me know. Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

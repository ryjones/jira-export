CDATA "a actor" should be "an actor" h1. Membership   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/membership/membership.html   a actor -> an actor {quote}It’s worth noting that just because *a actor* has the role of an administrator it doesn’t mean that they can administer particular resources! {quote} {quote}Even though an X.509 certificate has a {{ROLE}} attribute (specifying, for example, that *a actor* is an {{admin}}), this refers to *a actor*’s role within its organization rather than on the blockchain network. {quote} {quote}This is similar to the purpose of the {{OU}} attribute, which — if it has been defined — refers to *a actor*’s place in the organization. {quote} {quote}As a result, the administrator of an MSP, local or channel, can quickly revoke *a actor* or node from an organization by advertising the updated CRL of the CA the revoked certificate as issued by. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

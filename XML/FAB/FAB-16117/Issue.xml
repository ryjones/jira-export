CDATA This task is to ensure coverage for something similar to Item 83 of the "Behave Testcases" tab of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741. Actually, instead of doing exactly what item 83 originally tested (FAB-6333), we should just kill a cc container in a peer, and verify the cc can be used afterwards for query and/or invokes (and the peer should recreate it automatically).  A feasible way to do this might be to insert a step to delete a chaincode container in an existing test between invokes, to ensure the chaincode container is recreated automatically when a subsequent invoke or query is requested. Possible locations could be in a test in one of fabric/integration/nwo/ or* fabric/integration/chaincode/ *or fabric/integration/e2e/.  ></description> </Issue>

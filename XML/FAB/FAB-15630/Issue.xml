CDATA In many CC2CC scenarios, the callee needs to know and verify the caller's information. For example, in the implementation scenario of an oracle, the oracle CC accepts calls from the business CC and writes the URL access results back to the business contract in a callback. In the callback function, the business CC only trusts callbacks from the oracle CC. At the moment, due to the lack of the ability to obtain the caller's information, the oracle logic can only be placed in the same CC as a function library . Such an implementation brings troubles in the monitoring and processing of business events and oracle events.  ></description> </Issue>

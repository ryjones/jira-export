CDATA For chaincode-token integrated transactions, we have decided to enhance existing ENDORSER_TRANSACTION type instead of introducing a new transaction type. Use this CR to remove TokenEndorserTransaction proto message and enhance endorser transaction.  Benefits of this approach: 1. applications don't have to worry about different transaction types when invoking chaincode 2. don't have to face additional security issues related to introduce a new transaction type  Â   ></description> </Issue>

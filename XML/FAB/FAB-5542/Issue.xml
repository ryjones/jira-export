CDATA Orderers should be strictly enforced to boot with identical genesis file (with same hash), otherwise it would result in divergent blockchain.  Therefore, orderer should broadcast its genesis file hash when startup, and halts upon mismatch. However, we should allow at least one 'winner' in the network, so a newly joined orderer with different genesis hash won't bring down the whole network.  ></description> </Issue>

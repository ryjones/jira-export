CDATA We can close this, and abandon the effort to add this new behave testcase, because the NodeSDK tests the new cc lifecycle features: all queries, install of all three chaincode lang types, approve of all with two orgs, commit of all with two orgs and then finally invoke all three. Nothing about cc upgrades or negative testcases - which is OK because those tests belong in fabric repo anyways.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/test/scenario/features/chaincode_lifecycle.feature https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/test/scenario/features/steps/chaincode_steps.js  Note, however, Bret says as we move forward the NodeSDK 2.0 will not have support for Admin functions including Chaincode lifecycle. So we may need to revisit later.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA SDKs: ensure calls work the same with the same workflow as with the CLI  The Node and Java SDK wrappers in the fabric-test/feature/sdk directory need to be updated to ensure that the correct parameters are being passed with the correct APIs.  It is also recommended that the approve_chaincode and commit_chaincode functions are added.  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I use the <NodeJS SDK/Java SDK> interface And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 When a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "invoke","a","b","10"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 990 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

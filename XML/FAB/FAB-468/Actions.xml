CDATA I will not be adding support for QueueSize, at least right now. Upon further review:  # I claim that its purpose (at least as described in the orderer/config package) is ambiguous: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1153/3/orderer/orderer.yaml # It turns out that the Solo orderer does not implement it as described. # It may end up being an optimization that does not belong in the "General" section of a config file.  ></body> </Action>

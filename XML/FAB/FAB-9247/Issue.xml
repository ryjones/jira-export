CDATA In gotools/Makefile, a number of variables are set for the default acquisition of a number of gotools:  *go.fqp.dep := github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep* *go.fqp.golint := github.com/golang/lint/golint* *go.fqp.goimports := golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports* *go.fqp.gocov := github.com/axw/gocov/...* *go.fqp.misspell := github.com/client9/misspell/cmd/misspell* *go.fqp.gocov-xml:= github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml*  for the following rule:  *gotool.%:*   *$(eval TOOL = $\{subst gotool.,,$\{@}})*   *@echo "Building $\{go.fqp.$\{TOOL}} -> $(TOOL)"*   *@GOPATH=$(abspath $(TMP_GOPATH)) go get $\{go.fqp.$\{TOOL}}*  However, there is no need to set "go.fqp.dep" as that tool is processed explicitly by an earlier "gotool.dep:" rule and therefore doesn't invoke that default target, so setting "go.fqp.dep" would seem to be superfluous, no?  I realize it's not doing any harm, but I see no value in hanging onto unnecessary content. Thoughts?     ></description> </Issue>

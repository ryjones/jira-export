CDATA Historically, transactions in fabric could be validated by system chaincodes and later by go plugins - both of which aimed to be plug points so that alternative validation of endorser transactions could be defined. System chaincodes and go plugins are now being removed, and so the pluggable nature of validation should at least be preserved by defining a clear interface and using the "validation" field of a chaincode definition as a way of determining the correct implementation of that interface.  Alternatively, we could say that alternative validation of endorser transaction doesn't exist, we can only validate differently a different type of transaction. In this case, there is no need to even  have a field to store the alternate name of the system chaincode/plugin.  ></description> </Issue>

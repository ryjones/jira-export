CDATA Address the following comments made in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1080  #     Move the constants related to new function, just above the function. #     Though, not introduced in the PR but just noticed that array element access without checking lengths. A wrong input could cause panic. I recall that you mentioned that you had added that check but not included finally. But, it would be good to check for safety against a bad input.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In fabric-merge-end-2-end use to build nodeenv image to run sdk-node tests, gulp target in Fabric-chaincode-node "gulp docker-build-image" is no longer use to build nodeenv and the above error is observed. Fabric-chaincode-node project build system has been changed with a new tool called RUSH.

CDATA The CC1-call-CC2 will not work as work if CC2 is a system chaincode as the setup for system chaincodes are different from user chaincodes. In this task we will enable calling of system chaincode from user chaincode.   However there's another part to securing the call that needs to be done to complete this. That'll be addressed in another task (discussion in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2081 on that).  ></description> </Issue>

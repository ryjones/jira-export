CDATA In `core/endorser/endorser.go`, after simulating the transaction and collecting the read/write set, we call the endorser system chaincode (ESCC) to endorse the proposal response. However, to `endorseProposal()`, we pass the released `transaction simulator` object. Hence, an error would occur if we try to use this txsim.   Till now, default ESCC is not accessing the ledger. With a pluggable ESCC (static –  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/systemchaincode.html  ) and dynamic (the one that is being added to v1.2), the ESCC may access the ledger.   Hence, it would be better to create a `transaction simulator` and pass it via `endorseProposal()`.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA So, the endorser's plugin state fetcher (the abstraction for the query executor) always just grabs a new query executor:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/committer/txvalidator/plugin_validator.go#L216-L234   Therefore, the query executor in the endorser.go isn't going into the endorsement invocation itself.     I think that's OK though, no? because - the endorsement gets all the data it needs with regard to the simulation itself, because it obviously has to sign the thing, and also that way we don't hold the lock during the ECDSA signature that might take a millisecond?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Also - thanks for pointing out the documentation,  ~Senthil1 .   ~joe-alewine  ,  ~pandrejko  - we need to get ESCC and VSCC out of systemchaincode.html for v1.2 ;)     Shall I open a JIRA?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, the e2e test for "basic kafka network with 2 orgs" contains our tests surrounding golang docker builds for module and gopath chaincodes using _lifecycle. These should be moved to an appropriate place in the lifecycle tests, keeping this review comment from @sykesm in mind:Â  {code:java} This is tricky. The test is placed in e2e so we can reduce the number of networks and, hopefully, improve the speed of the tests. I like that.  On the other hand, this is pretty unrelated to the kafka network test - especially since we're de-prioritizing kafka going forward.  Is there a better place to put this within lifecycle that would not extend the execution times greatly? The fact that we are deploying chaincode with docker means they will always take a long time... {code}  ></description> </Issue>

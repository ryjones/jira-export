CDATA This is one of the Identity Mixer contributions to the fabric for privacy-preserving transaction signing.  It consists of the Identity Mixer crypto package (in Go lang) that provides the following functionality: * generating the issuer (CA) keys, * issuing certificates in a form of Identity Mixer credentials, * signing messages and selectively disclosing attributes from the certificates in a fully unlinkable manner, and * verifying such signatures.  ></description> </Issue>

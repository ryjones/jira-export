CDATA The goal is to make access control decisions in chaincode based on "client attributes".  I am using the term "client attributes" in its most general sense.  They could be arbitrary name/value pairs such as "admin=true" or "bank-account=1234", or predicates such as "I am over 21". Sometimes these attributes need not be private.  For example, it may be fine for everyone to know that I have an identity with "admin=true". In other cases such as the "bank-acount=1234" example, I may need to keep the attribute secret from everyone except the client, the fabic-ca-server, and the chaincode. This story focuses on the last case in which I want to keep an attribute as private as possible.    ></description> </Issue>

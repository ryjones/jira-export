CDATA Similar to using service discovery to determine the endorsers needed to meet a user-defined chaincode's endorsement policy, we should also be able to use it to discover the endorsers required to commit a chaincode definition using _lifecycle.  Acceptance: - Query _lifecycle on a specific channel and receive the valid list of endorsers required to meet the endorsement policy. (Version does not come into play.)  The list of endorsement should match the active configuration. This will likely involve creating a test with a non-standard _lifecycle endorsement policy.  ></description> </Issue>

Actually, they can and it works, and as mentioned in my issue description if one uses &quot;\u0000&quot; instead of &quot;&quot; for start key one gets what he needs. But this behaviour is not documented." created="2021-01-11 08:50:11.0" updateauthor="JIRAUSER19929" updated="2021-01-11 08:50:11.0"/>

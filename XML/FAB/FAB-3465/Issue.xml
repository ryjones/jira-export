CDATA In order to improve the test coverage of the bccsp/sw package, the following tasks are designed.  1. Replaces the switches with maps whose keys are opts types and values are interfaces representing key generation, key derivation, encryption and so on.. The reason for this is that it would allow the ability to test the single functionality (keygen, keyderiv, ...) in isolation and simplify testing of the bccsp implementation.  2. Add tests for the each component.  Actually, this two tasks can be run in parallel and a change-set can be submit for each bccsp method.  ></description> </Issue>

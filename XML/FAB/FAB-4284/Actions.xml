CDATA it's supposed to be very straightforward: our official publication channel is NPM, so you go there and search for "hyperledger" or "fabric", and you get fabric-client and fabric-ca-client, both entries have links that point to https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io.  So we need to clean up all the rest of the noise: - delete fabric-sdk-node.readthedocs.io  ~rameshthoomu  - update any links to the above and replace with https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io  ~nickgaski   ></body> </Action>

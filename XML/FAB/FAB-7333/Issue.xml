CDATA Test name: Performance test: filtered block events, 1 channel Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with levelDB     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_js, instantiated     transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 10000 invokes concurrently          thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1 Network Topology: docker containers; 1 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with the channel Client Driver: PTE Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error     each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself     each thread does not receive any event that not associated with the channel it registered The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

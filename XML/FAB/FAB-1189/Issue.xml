CDATA I have implemented a chaincode. I am trying to implement functionality where deployment of new version of chaincode migrates the ledger data from old version of chaincode. It does so by calling QueryChaincode method of ChaincodeStub and passing chaincodeID of old version. I have built the access control in all query and invoke function which uses securitycontext and metadata. However I found that QueryChaincode method does not pass attributes of ChaincodeSpec like SecureContext, ConfidentialityLevel, Metadata and Attributes. Due to this QueryChaincode is failing the access control implemented in old version of chaincode. I think it is necessary that above attributes should be passed to QueryChaincode  and InvokeChaincode  ></description> </Issue>

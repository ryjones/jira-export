CDATA The first four CRs in this series have been creating a paralllel implementation of the channel configuration, which no components are using.  The implementation should be compatible with the existing implementation, so components can be swapped out individually until there are no more references to the old model, and then it can be reomoved.  This CR moves the orderer to the newer immutable channelconfig bundle.  ></description> </Issue>

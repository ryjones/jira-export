CDATA The Getting Started doc relies on users executing a script that's pulled off github to get the environment set up. However, the script is really crude. It fails to detect errors that might happen halfway and stop if there is any. Instead it continues as if nothing went wrong. And when an error occurs it fails to provide the user with any useful info that could help them understand what might have gone wrong.  For instance, here is what I get on a windows box using cygwin:  $ ./bootstrap.sh % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 1193 0 1193 0 0 1918 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2153  gzip: stdin: not in gzip format tar: Child returned status 1 tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now ./bootstrap.sh: line 6: cd: release/cygwin_nt-6.1-wow-i686: No such file or directory sh: download-dockerimages.sh: No such file or directory  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA If a CouchDB username has been configured for the peer, enforce authentication for each database within CouchDB.  This can be done with the _security API:  http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/database/security.html   When peer gets a handle to a CouchDB database, CreateDatabaseIfNotExist() is called to validate that the database already exists, and creates the database if it doesn't already exist.  As part of this initial validation, also call the _security API to set the configured username as a database member.  Need to support several scenarios: * Newly created database with username credentials configured. * Username credentials added to peer after db creation. * Username credentials changed after db creation. * Username credentials removed after db creation.  Due to the above scenarios, simply re-PUT the db credentials each time CreateDatabaseIfNotExist() is called, rather than attempting to diff and update the list of database members.        ></description> </Issue>

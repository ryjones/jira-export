CDATA Although very recently introduced, the resources config followed the same mutable model as the channel config.  This leads to some awkward looking code with far  more lines than are actually needed.  This CR converts the resources config to follow the same bundle model that the channel config does.  It does not intrduce a bundle source like the channel config because for the moment, the resource config may not be changed.  ></description> </Issue>

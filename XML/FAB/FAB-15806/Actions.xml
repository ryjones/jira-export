CDATA This is not a bug as this is the intended design.  The error log message was added because many times clients fail to connect and it is difficult to debug.  Without this message, you'll generally only see "context cancelled" in the logs (which is not helpful).   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="61411" issue="40782" author="ymlbright" type="comment" body="I agree with you, but I suggest that we use an WARN log level instead of ERRO log level. Default log level is INFO in node, user can still find those helpful information in log. It‘s a little strange that Fabric node which are scanned by port scanner (such as Nmap)  print a lot of ERRO log." created="2019-07-02 08:48:53.0" updateauthor="ymlbright" updated="2019-07-02 08:48:53.0"/>

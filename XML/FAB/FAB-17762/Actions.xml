CDATA Introduced by https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/966 We will change the production code to ensure deterministic behavior. When a bunch of index files is passed to statecouchdb package, we should make it process all valid index and log error for the invalid index. Currently, we do log the error but at one level higher. We can log the error in statecouchdb package itself. If we don't fix this non-determinism, we will have some peers with all index and some peers with missing index.    Thanks to  ~sykesm  for pointing out this non-determinism.   ></body> </Action>

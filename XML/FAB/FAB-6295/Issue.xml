CDATA This was attempted in FAB-5930 however the upgrade was not complete. Certain grpc-go packages (including the core transport package) are still at an untagged version between 1.3 and 1.4.  Due to a  bug|https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/1401  in gRPC, the version currently vendored into fabric is incompatible with clients > v1.5. This forces clients to downgrade.  We propose to upgrade all grpc packages to the stable version 1.5.2     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like to be able to add and remove application, orderer, and channel capabilities. Consider whether we should allow setting unsupported capabilities outside of the existing ones or if we should just have toggles (ie EnableV20ApplicationCapabilities() and Disable...)     *Acceptance*  I should be able to call these functions to modify a config transaction and then process further configuration updates on the modified config transaction. The examples test should be updated to demonstrate usage of this feature.     ></description> </Issue>

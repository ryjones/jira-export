CDATA In order to save development time in the long term, and to have consolidation of code - it is preferable that we have a single communication layer which can fit all ordering service nodes regardless of their actual consensus algorithm, be it CFT or BFT.  Therefore, we need to define a protobuf schema that is oblivious of consensus algorithm implementation.  ></description> </Issue>

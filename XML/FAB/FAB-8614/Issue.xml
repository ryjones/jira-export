CDATA The e2e and byfn scripts rely on the output of {{configtxgen}} to update anchor peers.  This has always been a bit of a dirty hack, as the output of {{configtxgen}} assumes an untouched network.  For instance, changing anchor peers a second time will always fail.  If other changes have been made, such as modifications to the MSP, setting anchor peers will also fail.  Really, anchor peer updates should be done like any other config update, such as adding a capability or org, and our examples/tests should be fixed to do so.  ></description> </Issue>

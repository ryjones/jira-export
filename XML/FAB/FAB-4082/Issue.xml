CDATA Here's how we currently describe these two settings: {quote} * Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for the serialized messages in a batch. * Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed for the serialized messages in a batch. A message larger than the preferred max bytes will result in a batch larger than preferred max bytes.{quote} In both cases we write "allowed for the serialized messages in a batch", but in the first we actually mean that _each message_ cannot be more than AbsoluteMaxBytes, whereas in the second case we actually refer to _the batch in aggregate_.  This ambiguity results in user confusion and needs to be removed.  Solution:Â Improve and simplify the text. Give examples if needed. Rename the keys if needed as well and the change isn't too invasive. If AbsoluteMaxBytes refers to a different entity than PreferredMaxBytes their names shouldn't be so symmetrical. (Shouldn't AbsoluteMaxBytes be MaxEnvelopeSize?)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When an ordering service is used, be it Kafka, PBFT, Solo, etc. the service specific protocol can be abstracted away to a more generic 'orderer' API.  For some deployments the binding to the ordering service may wish to be done remotely, while in others the binding may be done locally.  In order to support both these scenarios, we should specify this orderer API as a gRPC service and corresponding Protobuf definitions.  Attached is a proposed proto for this service.

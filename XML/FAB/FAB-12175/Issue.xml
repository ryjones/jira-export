CDATA Some Fabric samples contain outdated configuration keys that have no effect whatsoever,  even such that were introduced in v1.0-alpha|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.2/balance-transfer/artifacts/base.yaml#L21  and never got to v1.0 GA.  As a result, users that read these samples are mislead and sometimes even share with other users these configuration parameters which no longer exist, or have changed.  Ideally - all configuration of samples would be inspired by the  e2e_cli|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.3/examples/e2e_cli  in the fabric core repository.  ></description> </Issue>

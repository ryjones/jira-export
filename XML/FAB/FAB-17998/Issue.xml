CDATA Since FAB-17733 adding a new raft consenter requires a valid certificate chain for its TLS certificates to be present in the orderer group. However, this means that you need two separate config updates to the channel in order to add a new organisation that contributes raft consenters.  Please consider speculatively applying the config update before validating raft consenters ( as suggested by Yacov|https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/message/8525 ) to be able to add such a new organisation with a single config update.  ></description> </Issue>

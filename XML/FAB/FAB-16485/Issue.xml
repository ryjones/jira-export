CDATA The goal is to make our test environment self-sufficient and more stable, not to test other chaincodes such as those in fabric-samples or fabric repositories. If a cc exists in another repo, that other repo owns it and should have their own tests to verify it works.  Review current cc usage for all tests inside fabric-test, and if necessary create our own chaincodes that exercise the logic funtionality desired, or make local copies in fabric-test/chaincodes/. We don't want our tests to break when the test chaincodes get changed by others.  An argument could be made for exceptions for marbles02 and marbles02_private, which are fully supported by fabric team (currently and intended to provide full API coverage and expect to be maintained continually; we could consider using these from remote repositories (currently fabric-samples). Discuss with the leads as appropriate. However, even for these, it may still be preferable to contain local copies within fabric-test repo. If for some reason the cc evolves, then we could update our own copies and fix our tests together in a controlled manner at aa convenient and appropriate time, to avoid unexpected test failures and CI disruptions.  ></description> </Issue>

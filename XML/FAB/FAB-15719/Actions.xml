CDATA Thanks  ~kopaygorodsky ! I was able to do what you suggested. There is just one minor issue though. The dind container for each pod needs to download fabric-ccenv image. This image is kind of big and this causes the instantiation process to take a bit longer than usual. I hope I'll find a solution to solve this minor issue.  Anyway, thanks again for your help.  ></body> </Action>

When I instantiate the chaincode a new docker image is created (chaincode container with a name like  dev-peer0.org1.example.com-mycc-1.0-384f11f484b9302df90b453200cfb25174305fce8f53f4e94d45ee3b6cab0ce9  ) but since it&apos;s not created by Kubernetes, it&apos;s not part of the Kubernetes cluster and it can&apos;t enjoy features like high availability and scaling. What can I do to bring this container into Kubernetes cluster? I thought maybe changing the CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE environment variable to the network that Kubernetes pods reside in would help but apparently the docker network must be of type bridge and the docker network that Kubernetes pods reside in is of type null!  What can I do?" priority="1" status="10100" created="2019-06-14 00:14:34.0" updated="2020-12-13 13:01:06.0" votes="0" watches="7" workflowId="53531"/>

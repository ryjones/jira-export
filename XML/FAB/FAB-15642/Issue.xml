CDATA Currently the maintenance filter is not allowing config changes other than consensus type changes in maintenance mode. It seems generally useful that the network operator might want to for instance to modify batch parameters before switching over consensus type, to add new certificate authorities, etc.  We therefore lift the restriction and let the admin do any kind of config change he is authorized to in maintenance mode.   Two restrictions remain:  # Entry to- and exit from- maintenance mode should not be accompanied by any config change;  # ConsensusType.Type can change only in maintenance-mode.   ></description> </Issue>

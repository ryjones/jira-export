CDATA Chaincode developers should be able to check ACL policies inside their code to manage access to resources.  ACL validation could be done as soon as a request comes via Invoke or inside a particular function. This feature is implementation/use-case agnostic.  This way, any consortium can use declared access policies to add a function-level control that allows to use certificate attributes to restrict certain user actions.  ></description> </Issue>

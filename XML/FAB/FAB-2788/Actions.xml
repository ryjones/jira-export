CDATA I got an additional information on peer crash problem FAB-1163 from Dave Enyeart. https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ledger?msg=5e8tveA4YnraFJnGc  In summary, there is a timeout when a transaction (query/invoke/deploy) takes to much time. This option was a fixed value of 30s and not configurable but extended to be configurable in v1.0 a few days ago. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2767   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for providing all the detail  ~rjkuro . I'll move this to fabric-ledger so that it can be easily referenced, but I'll actually close the bug since it is not applicable to 1.0 and no enhancements are planned for 0.6.  ></body> </Action>

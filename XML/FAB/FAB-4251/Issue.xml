CDATA Per attached Security scan report , the TLS version is set to 0 in *   *fabric/orderer/kafka/util.go*   Remediation : *        Remove MinVersion and MaxVersion from TLS config as go TLS by default support TLS 1.2 or * Set MinVersion also to be TLS 1.2 explicitly.  If MinVersion and MaxVersion , both are set to 0 , it means the supported TLS versions are TLS 1.0 , 1.1 and 1.2. This is what is being set in the code currently.   ~mastersingh24  , upto you , what do you want to implement :  # Support only TLS 1.2 or # Support TLS 1.0 , 1.1 and 1.2.     ></description> </Issue>

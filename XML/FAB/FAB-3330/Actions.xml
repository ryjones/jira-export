CDATA Sprint 16 should be our final sprint.   We want to feature freeze.    I see you just created (2 days ago)  this Jira and it references 3329 (also create 2 days ago).    Can we defer these.   If you think these can;t be deferred please talk to  ~binhn  or  ~mastersingh24 .   Maintainers are now cross referencing CRs to Jira items.   ></body> </Action>

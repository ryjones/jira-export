CDATA Update fabric-sdk-java job configuration to pull images from nexus and run the e2e tests. This eliminates building docker images happens on every fabric-sdk-java patchsets.  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-end-2-end-x86_64/ publishes fabric & fabric-ca  "stable" tagged docker images to nexus and pull these images in the SDK jobs to eliminate building docker images again and again.  Note: After this change is merged in CI, SDK's no more clone/pull the fabric and fabric-ca repos and build images on the latest commit but it looks for the "stable" image which CI published from the fabric-merge-e2e-x86_64 job.  ></description> </Issue>

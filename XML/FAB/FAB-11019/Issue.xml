CDATA This issue is a New Feature request/specification from Tecnalia Research & Innovation  Current developments of *Hyperledger Fabric* relay on the creation of a REST API services for interactions. This is an easy way to start an interaction with the *CA* and with the smart contracts code but it generates a *SPOF* and in most cases, breaks with decentralization of apps, forcing to all clients to go through the rest api for interacting.     We propose the creation of a *Javascript* based SDK (based on Node.js) which will support basic interactions against the Blockchain.     ></description> </Issue>

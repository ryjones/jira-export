CDATA Currently common case quorum and view change quorum sizes are N-F. We can optimize conservative N-F sized quorums in commonCase and view change as follows.   1) Common case quorum is the number of commit messages needed and number of prepare messages needed minus one (as primary does not send prepare). In general, we need every two common case quorums of size X to intersect in at least F+1 orderers, hence 2X>=N+F+1, or X is: X= Ceil((N+F+1)/2)  2) Then we need every view change quorum (of size Y) to intersect with every common case quorum in F+1 orderers and hence Y = N+F+1 - X, where X is defined above.  ></body> </Action>

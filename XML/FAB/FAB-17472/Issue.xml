CDATA Copied from:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17059?focusedCommentId=65793&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-65793  Given that the MSP configuration contains a single fabric_node_ous field, adding a CA to an existing MSP might create problems. Indeed, if any of the OU identifiers (client, peer, admin or orderer) sets the certificate field, the client, peer, admin or orderer certificate issued by one of the two CAs will be invalid after the config update. We might want to extend the certificate field to become a slice.  The certificate field in question can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/sampleconfig/msp/config.yaml#L14  Alternatively, we can clarify the documentation and recommend to only set a Certificate in the NodeOU configuration if you really want a specific certificate to issue NodeOU classifications.  ></description> </Issue>

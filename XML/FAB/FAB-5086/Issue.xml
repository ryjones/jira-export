CDATA Private data may be missing for a variety of reasons:  1) Peer may not have access to private data  2) Peer did not previously have access to private data  3) Peer had access to private data, but couldn't find private data at validation time.Â    This feature will check for missing private data at endorsement time and return error accordingly.  Also, since not all peers will have data to support validation of non-key queries, invalidate transactions that performed non-key queries.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, MSP administrators are named one by one at configuration time. It might be convenient, in certain cases, to able to identifies MSP administrators by using the Organisational Units they belong to without have to name them explicitly. Therefore, we propose to enhance the MSP configuration to allow to specify an OU that identity the administrators of that MSP. Namely, we propose to add the following new protobuf message:  {code:java} message FabricAdminOUs { // If true then an administrators are identities by their OUs, otherwise they need // to be named one by one. bool   Enable = 1;  // OU Identifier of the clients FabricOUIdentifier adminOUIdentifier = 2; {code}  to FabricMSPConfig. At setup time, if FabricAdminOUs.Enable is equal True then the MSP will enforce only identities carries the specified OU will be considered administrators of that MSP, otherwise, the previous behaviour is enforced.   ~mastersingh24 ,  ~smithbk ,  ~elli-androulaki ,  ~ales , please, have you say :)   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The high level idea makes sense for the channel MSPs, though I'm not sure about the implementation.  Do we want to have both admin certs and this message in the long run? I'm not sure...  My guess would be that it would make sense to consolidate the admin property into 1 proto message, and have that message reflect all possible enumerations of admins, be it one-by-one identities, OUs or fair coin tossing. Therefore, I'd suggest we also copy the  repeated bytes admins|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/protos/msp/msp_config.proto#L69  field to that message while we're at it, and then since we have versioned MSPs, we could deprecate the old admin field at some point, no?  Another thing - I think this approach can also be used for the local MSP. Why not extend the node's  local MSP config|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/msp/config.yaml  with an OU that is the administrator OU?  ></body> </Action>

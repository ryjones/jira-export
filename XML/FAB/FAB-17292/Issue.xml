<Issue id="43788" key="FAB-17292" number="17292" project="10002" reporter="rameshthoomu" creator="rameshthoomu" type="10002" summary="&quot;disable gossip&quot; causes peer blocks out of sync with the orderer." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2019-12-20 19:30:23.0" updated="2021-04-16 15:37:42.0" resolutiondate="2021-04-16 15:37:42.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="57641"> <description><! CDATA Make sure the fabric network is configured with gossipDisable. See the config here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/release-1.4/tools/operator/testdata/kafka-couchdb-tls-network-spec.yml#L22  Make sure kafka to raft migration is done  Once the migration is done, send invoke transactions from PTE tool.  Observed below error  after migration is completed from kafka(v2.2.2) to raft on fabric 1.4.2 code base. Please see the attached orderer log files.  Tested above test case on multiple kafka versions (1.1.1 and 2.2.2) with fabric 1.4.2 and 1.4.4 code base. Below are my findings.  Observed blocks are creating for the transactions we are sending from the PTE tool but noticed "unreceived events" in the PTE log.  `CONSTANT INVOKE Overall event: received 0 timeout 0 *unreceived 80*`  "eventOpt": { "type": "FilteredBlock", "listener": "Block",  I see there is no communication between Orderer and Peer. So the peer is unable to fetch the block information from Orderer.     Not observed this issue in master branch with the same configuration.        ></description> </Issue>

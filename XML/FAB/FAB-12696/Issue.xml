CDATA When pure fake implementations of meters are used, there's no validation done on the label cardinality or on the validity of the resulting bucket names (stasd) or metric name (prometheus).  We should consider creating a provider explicitly for test that validates these requirements while recording the metric. (Could be a simple as using the stastsd write to implementation to get the results at the end of the test and validate all the contents.)  Additionally, the provider should attempt to validate label values for conflicts with the rules implemented by prometheus and statsd.  ></description> </Issue>

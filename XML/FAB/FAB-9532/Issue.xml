CDATA From Stack Overflow 4/14  What is an artifact?  I see the word everywhere in building a Hyperledger network, but I don't exactly know what it is and the Hyperledger docs don't return a definition when I query them.  Maybe it's a dumb question because the docs don't define it and assume you should know, but I don't and can't find a precise answer to it.  Â  Artifacts in Hyperledger are channel configuration files which are required for the Hyperledger Fabric network. They are generated at the time of network creation.  These include: # Genesis.block: First block of a chain, that initializes a block chain # Channel.tx: Channel configuration transaction # Org1MSPanchors.tx: Anchor Peer update (Defining a peer from Org1 as an anchor peer)  configtxgen command is used to create the above channel config artifacts.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA On April 5th, a changeset was merged to fabric-sdk-node for FABN-909, and broke all fabric-test/ PTE tests:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30450/   indicating it moved User.js to * fabric-common/lib/User.js  from * fabric-client/lib/User.js  So it looks like PTE code must be modified accordingly, for this and others too that moved (utils.js, and impl directory): {quote}$ grep -r -n User.js *  PTE/pte-util.js:30:var User = require('fabric-client/lib/User.js');  $ grep -r -n fabric-client/lib/utils.js * {quote}  This new changeset in fabric-test includes exactly this fix:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30970/  ></body> </Action>

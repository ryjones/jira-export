CDATA https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-integration-tests-x86_64/9231/consoleFull  This is what happened from orderer5's point of view when flake occurs: 1. start 2*. consume its log to observe {{0 -> 1}} leader change 3. orderer1 is killed 4. consume its log to observe {{0/1 -> X}} leader change 5. submit tx to orderer5  2 is not currently performed, so that chunk of log is never consumed, which causes 4 to instantly pass. subsequently, 5 is executed too quickly and fails test.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As per  ~rickr  request, publish multiarch images (ex: 1.3) along with 1.3.0 and :latest tags to docker hub after successfully publish the images to dockerhub.  This helps sdk's to use 1.3 tag which should pull 1.3.0 (current latest), if the version is changed to 1.3.1 (future latest) that should work without changing the sdk scripts.  ></description> </Issue>

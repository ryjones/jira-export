<Action id="28361" issue="19248" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Hi  ~jyellick  . It appears Sandeep found a good bug in the configtxgen tool. I think it is ALSO a bug in the orderer, which should not have accepted the create-channel config transaction in the first place because it was incomplete. I would think a modification policy, for every policy, should be required (except for those policies (if any) that can never be changed). Could you put that enforcement in the fabric code too?" created="2017-07-13 21:54:28.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2017-07-13 21:54:28.0"/>

CDATA  ~scottz  Yes, this is a good find by  ~sandp125   If this were pre-v1, I would be inclined to make the breaking change you suggest.  However, as this would break existing deployments, I don't think forbidding this action is a good idea for 1.0.1.  I think the appropriate course of action is to add a warning to the log for now, and once we have a way to differentiate between fabric versions, consider enforcing it strictly for new channels.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jyellick  sorry to ask but I am new to blockchain and I am learning through    http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html   seems it's just a docker compose command to start the environment and I don't know how to use configtxgen explicitly...  I am sure my env is 1.0.1 as it's built 2 days before and I saw this bug already fixed for about 1 month...     will check more and see whether I can have any clue , thanks for your info  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello,   I have the same problem that  ~jichen  .    ~jyellick , you told him that he should use new configtxgen tool. However please note that in project  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/chaincode-docker-devmode  , artefacts are already generated and posted. Probably the reason of this error is usage of artefacts generated by old configtxgen tool with bug mentioned. Do you know with whom I can contact to regenerate this artefacts and push on GitHub?   Brgds  Rafal  ></body> </Action>

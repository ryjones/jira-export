CDATA After finishing the other tasks in this epic by rewriting all the required Behave tests in the Fabric Integration golang, we must clean up the following, on master branch AND in release-1.4 : * +CI+:  Abandon the CI job for fabric-test behave daily tests * +CI+: Remove the behave results from the fabric-test daily results job * +fabric-test+: Remove scripts/install_behave.sh and remove all references to behave tests from Makefile and README and regression/daily/ and regression/smoke/. Remove any associated build targets that are not used elsewhere (e.g. consider removing fabric-ca-client - although I think that one is still used by CTE). Clean up the scripts/pull* bash scripts. (Note the behave tests were already removed from the master branch smoke test suite here - but the Makefile was not cleaned up, and the daily tests are still running:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-test/+/33942/6/regression/smoke/runSmokeTestSuite.sh ) * +fabric-test+: Remove all test code in feature/ and feature-upgrade/.     ></description> </Issue>

If you are not using the all-in-one `bootstrap.sh` script to bootstrap everything, it is up to you to download the correct dependencies. It is expected you would pull the correct image version and retag it as latest yourself.  It is also up to you to download the matching config files and binaries. And you also would need to checkout the correct tag of samples to match all of these deps.  Samples does not easily exist independent of the bootstrapping script. We are aware of the deficiencies in this process and we have plans to address it, but until we do, it's highly recommended, unless you understand exactly what your deps are and how to retrieve them, that you use the bootstrapping script.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~bdjukic  Why are you running the `peer node start` command manually?  Once you run `start.sh`, the peer is already started.  If you run the command again, the peer tries to open a ledger file that has already been created and opened, so the bug is expected behavior here.  ></body> </Action>

I've figured out what is the issue. The reason why I was trying to start it manually was because I was getting *failed with error: "exec: not started"* when I tried to deploy my first chaincode on the peer. That is why I thought the peer itself was not running and I was trying to kick it off by myself.   After some googling I figured out that this message comes out when I tried to deploy the chaincode directly onto the peer and not using peer CLI:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44576816/can-not-install-chaincode-via-cli.  A friendlier error message would have saved me some time :P  Cheers,  B.  ></body> </Action>

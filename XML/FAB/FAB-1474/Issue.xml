CDATA Go through JIRA and find what stories with the "fabric-peer", "fabric-baseimage", "fabric-devenv", "fabric-gossip", and "fabric-membersrvc" components and corresponding labels have been completed. (API tests will cover the SDK components, not behave/functional tests.)   Compare as to whether there are feature files and scenarios for each story if needed. (may not be in the hyperledger/fabric repository under the bddtests directory) If it seems that a scenario is needed, write a general description of the scenario (not steps) and the associated owner/assignee of the story. A scenario is a one line test description.  *Output:* A list of scenarios or possible scenarios that will be discussed with a developer/owner.  ></description> </Issue>

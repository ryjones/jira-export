CDATA In the meantime, let me say this. The main point in the attached error message is *MSP PeerOrg10 is unknown*. It means that in the channel where the operation has been performed does not contain an MPS whose ID is *PeerOrg10.*  Now, what we can additional do is to print the identity in a more human readable form. The identity there is, at the end of the day, an X509 certificate. Would be okay to print the X509 certificate in a more human readable form?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~angelo.decaro  Three things that would help:  1) "{{PeerOrg10}} is unknown" would be more understandable as "PeerOrg10 is not defined on the channel".  2) "{{deserialization failure}}" gives users the wrong impression that there was some encoding issue.  3) Have the caller provide context of what it was doing functionally when the error was hit (e.g. was it checking the signer of a transaction proposal? checking the signer of an endorsement? etc).  And yes, making the identity human readable would help (if that doesn't leak any info), so make that four things.  ></body> </Action>

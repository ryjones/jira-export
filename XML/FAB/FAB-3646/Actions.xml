CDATA I agree with  ~mastersingh24    ~pvrbharg  The error message is showing the issue with your crypto directory. There was a mismatch with the old getting started and the level of code you were using. If you go back and use the current getting started you'll be in good shape.  peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME -f ./channel-artifacts/channel.tx --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/cacerts/ca.example.com-cert.pem  I'm going to close this particular issue, if you run into something else please let us know.  ></body> </Action>

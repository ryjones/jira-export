CDATA This epic aims at the refactoring of MSP interfaces and structures to allow for a more intuitive policy evaluation flow, as well as an easily extensible policy types.      In the context of this refactoring, we aim also to allow the definition of "orderer" type (in addition to "peer" and "client" that is already supported), as well as the consideration of an expiration time at policy evaluation.      Our proposed changes refer to the interfaces of  MSP, Identity, MSPPrincipal proto structures and Policy evaluation mechanisms.

CDATA With the new deploy model where the installation is on the file system, we cannot use the deploy proposal (or the new "instantiate" proposal) to install the code - that proposal will turn into a TX and we don;t want to ship the bytes to the channel.  The "on peer" install is not quite satisfactory for developers who have to log on to a peer to install before they do anything.    This task will implement a new "install" Invoke command on the LCCC whose only purpose is to put the code on the file system. It is the equivalent of the "peer chaincode install..." command except that it will also go through the endorsement process.  ></description> </Issue>

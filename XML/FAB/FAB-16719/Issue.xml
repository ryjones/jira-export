CDATA Write an interop test suite (using various make targets, depending on which repo the triggering update was merged) in fabric-test/Makefile to execute a group of tests from whatever repositories, which can be used in interop jobs in CI pipeline for fabric project repositories.  To cover node-sdk, inside fabric-test, write golang test driver, using operator and launcher to launch a network with RAFT orderering service with CouchDB.Â  Then use PTE to interact with node-sdk to perform the following test * private data * service discovery  To cover java-sdk, execute the e2e Integration test from that repo. The tests will include the following on a network with solo orderering service with levelDB using sample chaincodes in various languages * e2e golang chaincode * e2e java chaincode * e2e node js chaincode * idemix  The detail of the tests and their associated network configuration are given in  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=192492918   ></description> </Issue>

Could you explain the reason why balance-transfer is removed? You may have written the reason on the Pivotal Tracker but I couldn’t assess to the link. Many application developers utilize balance transfer because it was a best practice for SDK and Chaincode. It might be better to write the reason in the release note of v2.0.0 alpha.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~yuki-kon   - Actually, the point is that the application was not using best practices and people were building "production" apps based on it.  That's why new samples applications for Node SDK were introduced in 1.4.x and continued in mater/2.0.0.  Reason to remove:  1) The sample uses a REST server ... and while people may want to try to build REST interfaces, this was not the way to do it nor was it officially supported by anyone.  There were many questions about the REST piece itself which was really not the point of the sample.  2) The sample stored the private keys for multiple users .... meaning you login via REST but the reality is that behind the scenes the server was enrolling with the CA and storing the keys for multiple users in the middle tier.  This is not a best practice.  3) There were too many "wrapper" layers in the application.  While it sounds like you were able to modify this sample, most others were not.  We want to demonstrate actually using the SDK APIs not wrapper around them.  The new samples do this.  ></body> </Action>

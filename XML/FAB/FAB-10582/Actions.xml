CDATA We were able to run some simpler traffic tests in a single org, without seeing those WARN logs.  We will enhance our startup scripts to set anchor peers in each org. This should alleviate the problem with obtaining the private data across org boundaries.  Since it is necessary to establish an anchor peer in every org that has a peer that requires sharing private data, then this should be documented as a requirement in the new feature documentation. I looked and could see that it is mentioned in the new  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22817/1/docs/source/private-data-arch.rst .  In addition, I am redirecting question 2 above to a new bug for discussion on that topic separately.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~scottz  this is a quote from *anchor peer* section of gossip documentation:   {quote} Anchor peers are used to facilitate gossip communication between peers from **different** organizations. In order for cross-org gossip to work, peers from one org need to know at least one address of a peer from other orgs (from this peer, it can find out about all of the peers in that org). This address is the anchor peer, and it's defined in the channel configuration. {quote}  since private data primarily distributed between peers of different organization, I think that having anchors peers  setup correctly explicitly follows from paragraph above, specifically   {quote} Anchor peers are used to facilitate gossip communication between peers from **different** organizations. {quote}  you can find it here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gossip.html  ---------  Since this is proven to be a misconfiguration issue and 60s retry timeout is in fact configurable and could be controlled, I'd suggest we close this item since worked as designed.

CDATA That gossip doc reads well, but what I think it would be helpful to also have something explicit about using anchor peers where we explain the use of the private data / sidedb feature. Has that been done, or in the works?  Otherwise, yes we can allow Dave to comment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Since the Anchor peer setup essential part for the feature, I'm not seeing good examples and documentation for Anchor Peer setup from Node SDK.

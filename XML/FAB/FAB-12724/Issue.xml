CDATA Revise and replace  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/first-network/scripts/upgrade_to_v13.sh  with a version that works with v14, for both scenarios: after 1.4 is released (upgrade 1.3 to 1.4), and while it is still in development (upgrade to "latest").   Also, refer to earlier versions of this in v1.2 FAB-10199 and v1.3 FAB-11778 for more details of this upgrade test. Especially, refer to other tasks "related to" FAB-11778.  ></description> </Issue>

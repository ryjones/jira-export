CDATA This relates to the design and implementation of the components of the system that allow for orderers to perform access control on a channel's data, and peers to enforce access control on a chain's transactions and events.  Therefore, we include in this epic:  - design documentation on channel/chain AC structures and Configuration parameters / reconfiguration authorization - chain security components setup to allow for AC management at the peer side - channel security components setup to allow for AC management at the orderer side - chain access settings reconfiguration  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA CouchDB occasionally doesn't respond for 30s - update peer timeout.  Occasionally CouchDB doesn't respond for (exactly) 30s.  This is most often seen in create database calls which happens frequently during unit tests.   The default peer behavior is to retry couch after 20s, and therefore these occurrences disrupt unit tests and causes them to fail occasionally.  This change will set the peer CouchDB timeout to 35s for now, in order to avoid the retries in the peer avoid the unit test problems.  The root cause of the 30s delay is being worked with CouchDB team in FAB-3318.    ></description> </Issue>

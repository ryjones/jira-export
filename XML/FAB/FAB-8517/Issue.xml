CDATA Command *peer channel fetch* is used against an orderer deliver service to fetch a block.  If you forget to add -o to connect to an orderer, you get error:  *Error: ordering service endpoint  is not valid or missing*  However, starting in 1.1 the peer also supports the deliver service, and therefore this command can be used against a peer now.  The command should be improved to go against an orderer or a peer.  ></description> </Issue>

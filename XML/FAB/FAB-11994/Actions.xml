CDATA I was talking to Anthony O'Dowd about this and wanted to capture his thoughts:  It's also a trade off, as separate chaincodes, give you separate ledgers. This cannot be done without affecting applications quite radically It's a matter of degree though.  Let's say an app was doing chaincode1 func1 putState and chaincode 1 func2 getState. Moving func2 to chaincode2  won't work as the states are now invisible to each other so we need to be careful here.  I'm pretty sure the chaincode ID scopes the CouchDB tables        ></body> </Action>

CDATA The second paragraph of the Starter Kit page reads:  Further exploration  If you wish, there are a number of chaincode examples near by.  cd ../../chaincode  At that point in the page this command makes no sense whatsoever At the minimum this section needs to be moved further down where it makes sense and be given some context so that the user knows in which terminal window and from which directory to type this command. It's probably better to give an absolute path in this case.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The last run for Behave daily tests is not failing due to timeout error, All tests in Behave daily were completed in 9 hours, 11 minutes.   There are test case failures in CouchDB Index, Chaincodes, Gossip, Orderer tests . I will address this in new Jira items if they fail again.   *Build Logs*  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/75/consoleFull  https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-test-daily-behave-master-x86_64/75/    ></body> </Action>
<Action id="53052" issue="35064" author="scottz" type="comment" body="This issue should be closed (but we can wait until tomorrow to make sure the timeouts are captured correctly for a second successive day). The other test failures seen today should be flagged as new issues. If the CI team cannot investigate and provide an explanation as to why the timeouts never happened, then maybe close this (and reopen again if the problem resurfaces). The timeouts worked correctly on desktop, just not in the CI test runs, so it is not a testcase issue." created="2018-11-05 21:49:12.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-11-05 21:49:12.0"/>

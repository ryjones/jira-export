CDATA Each time a chaincode is compiled in the Docker container {{fabric-ccenv}}, all its dependencies need to first be built.  This can be seen by running {{go build -v}} in a folder with a chaincode in a container running the {{fabric-ccenv}} image.  This can be solved by installing these dependencies in {{fabric-ccenv}}. Concretely, I think this would just mean adding the following line to the file {{fabric/images/ccenv/Dockerfile.in}}: {code:java} RUN go install github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer {code} When using a customized {{fabric-ccenv}} image with this optimization (via the environment variable {{CORE_CHAINCODE_BUILDER}}), I get a significant reduction in compilation time for the chaincode (two times faster in my case).  ></description> </Issue>

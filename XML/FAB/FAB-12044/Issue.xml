CDATA The javaenv image used by the test is not pulled down as part of the make process. In particular, it's not one of the dependencies of the integration-test target or its transient dependency docker-thirdparty.  The fact that the javaenv image is not currently published to docker hub complicates things slightly as well as we have to pull from nexus and tag manually.   ></description> </Issue>

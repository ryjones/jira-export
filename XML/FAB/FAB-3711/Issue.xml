CDATA I started a network with 4 peers of 2 orgs, 2 orderers (orderer0 and orderer1), 2 kafka brokers. I could use node SDK to create channel (mychannel.tx), manage peers joining channel, install chaicode, instantiate chain code etc...    However, when I restart orderer0 and orderer1, chaincode invocation cannot be processed by the orderer any more. The Orderer verification passed but it does not deliver the block. The last statement in the command line is: "  Consenter instructed us to shut down"     Using the file ledger, I have already configured the Orderer/kafka persisting data into the mounted volume. It can reload the block file after restarting but still cannot deliver the block.      If the orderer is not fault-resilient even using file ledger, then the application of hyper ledger fabric will be greatly compromised      ></description> </Issue>

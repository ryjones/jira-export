CDATA Feng, thank you for getting back to me with details.  I've inspected your setup and the logs, and I am fairly confident that you were hitting the bug fixed in -FAB-2915-.  If you know how to build Fabric Docker images (assuming a proper Golang dev environment, you git clone the Fabric repo to $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger, then cd into the fabric directory and do "make docker"), please try it out with the current master and let me know if the issue persists.  Otherwise, hold on for a few more days – we're about to cut alpha-2 any day now, maybe even this Friday. Try it out with the new release and let me know if the problem persists, so that we can update this JIRA accordingly.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Kostats, thank you for your prompt response.   Ok, I did not notice this JIRA Bug report as I have been using the alpha1 version as our testbed.   Great to know this, looking forward to the alpha 2 release, and hopefully, it can function stably in some way....   ></body> </Action>

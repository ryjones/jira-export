CDATA RocksDB has a patent infringement license in it from Facebook. The legal team is therefore not comfortable with using it. For details read: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/PATENTS  The alternatives include 1. LevelDB (https://github.com/google/leveldb) with a go wrapper (https://github.com/jmhodges/levigo), 2. *goleveldb* (https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb) - a porting of leveldb in golang 3. BoltDB (https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)  BoltDB is suitable for read heavy workloads (e.g., LDAP) but has a relatively poor performance for read-write workloads. Of the other two options, *goleveldb* is chosen because it is implemented in golang and hence easy to intergate and maintain. In addition, as a precedent, ethereum go implementation also uses this package (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/ethdb/database.go)  ></description> </Issue>

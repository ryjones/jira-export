CDATA as an operator, I should have a cli that I can easily install that lets me interact with the various components of the fabric  The current peer commands are entangled with the validating peer capability, which means that building and installing a peer for Mac and Windows is complicated by the need to have RocksDB etc installed.  We can extract the peer commands into a separate component that is not dependent on the internals of the peer node, that can be simply installed as a platform-specific binary.  ></description> </Issue>

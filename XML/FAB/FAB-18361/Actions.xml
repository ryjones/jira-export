CDATA Most of the libraries have been updated. Notably, we still can't update viper (because it really is configuration with fangs) and a number of other dependencies that require a minimum version of protobuf-1.4.  The big issue with protobuf is that it breaks etcd. The minor issues with protobuf are that google decided to introduce behaviors like their `detrand` package to prevent people from testing against their error messages while still not providing a sentinel error (as they did in the v2 of their package) to evaluate errors against. This has a ripple effect on a bunch of our tests.  The protobuf issue also prevents picking up new versions of gomega and prometheus. I believe it will also prevent us from picking up grpc-middleware changes.  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The biggest remaining bit of work is to handle the x509 verification path / ignoreCN issues. The first step is to create a test on the verify path and then pull in enough code to address it.  We also have the outstanding questions about the changes to the CRL validation.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Focus of this one was Go v1.15. I've moved the protobuf upgrade subtask to its own issue, and will create another task for Go v1.16.  Closing the v1.15 task as done.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA thanks to  ~jiangyaoguo  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1457 adds support for pb.Response to be returned from chaincode instead of (  bytes, err). As described in FAB-1457, response codes < 500 can be endorsed and (potentially) turned into transactions.   This would require Response to be added to ChaincodeAction in fabric/peer/proposal.proto. And set at endorsement time.  ></description> </Issue>

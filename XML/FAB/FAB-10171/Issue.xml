CDATA For the sake of more visually obvious patches to the doc files, I propose restructuring all of the doc files so that each sentence corresponds to a single physical line, regardless of the length of the sentence. While a first reaction to that idea is, "Oh, man, that means really long sentences are going to stream off the right end and I have to scroll over to the right to see them," it also means that patches are more focused and localized and reflect *only* the changes.  As it stands now, if one wants to physically wrap lines to not exceed 80 characters, if you, say, add a new sentence in the middle of a lengthy paragraph, then the remainder of that paragraph would have to be refactored and, visually, the change would appear as a wide-sweeping change to a massive hunk of that paragraph, which is misleading.  The "one line per sentence" standard is used by the  Pro Git book at GitHub|https://github.com/progit/progit2 , and when I started contributing to that project, I was initially put off by that standard, but it took very little time to appreciate that it was, in fact, the right way to do things. So give it some thought.  ></description> </Issue>

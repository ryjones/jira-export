CDATA We would like to include the fabric repository as a git submodule in our repository as a dependency. Ideally, we would be able to build the necessary images and executables that are needed from this submodule.   Currently, the Makefile makes some assumptions that the directory structure will be "hyperledger/fabric/..." The Makefile should be more flexible to allow for a different structure.  ></description> </Issue>

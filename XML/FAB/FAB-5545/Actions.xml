CDATA  ~rameshthoomu   ~ryjones   ~ChristopherFerris   ~mastersingh24   ~greg.haskins : I would like your opinion on this issue. (Feel free to add others as you see fit.)  I am proposing a simple fix of changing the Makefile variable PROJECT_NAME to use "hyperledger/fabric" as the default if the PROJECT_NAME env variable is not set and using "$(PROJECT_NAME)/fabric" if it is set.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The problem with that is that we would have to wait for a build to be deployed to an external location and not be able to build based on a set commit in fabric. Performing this task will allow us to be able to freely test against a specific sha at any given time. Especially if we are running daily test, we should be able to build accordingly.  Including fabric as a submodule allows the use of existing chaincodes and other tools in the fabric repo. If we are doing this, why would we not also _allow_ for the building of the fabric images? It is not vital to build from this location. We should be able to use whatever images are made available. But making this change allows for more flexibility in testing and what can be tested at a given snapshot in the development cycle.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The etcdraft package presently handles all of the parsing and validation of config updates for etcdraft consensus parameters within the etcdraft package itself.  This is very problematic for a number of reasons:  1) This forces etcdraft to re-implement the config update parsing, and there have been several bugs discovered around scenarios where that parsing was actually not being done correctly. 2) There are multiple reconfiguration scenarios, including creating new channels, modifying existing channels, starting up in a bootstrap scenario, where the config must be validated, and all of these cases are currently handled independently (though with some shared code). 3) Finally, the interwoven nature of config processing with the rest of the consensus logic is simply messy and difficult to maintain, and makes understanding the consensus plugin more difficult.  Finally, as we move towards BFT, we will almost definitely need a very similar plug-point for BFT config update validation.  We should be able to convert this processing into a re-usable component acceptable for both.  ></description> </Issue>

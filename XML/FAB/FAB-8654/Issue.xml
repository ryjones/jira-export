CDATA Fabric Java Chaincode moved to Gradle 4.4.1 in FAB-7626. The Java environment docker image and dev environment should also be moved to Gradle 4.4.1. Currently they are using Gradle 2.12.     At least in my environment, with Java 1.8.0_152, the Java platform chaincode unit tests in the Fabric project are failing. Upgrading to Gradle 4.4.1 resolves the failures.  ></description> </Issue>

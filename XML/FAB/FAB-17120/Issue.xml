CDATA Counter to FAB-15066 where peer.ApplicationPolicy was moved to common.ApplicationPolicy, after some discussion with  ~jyellick  it would have probably made more sense to move the common.StaticCollectionConfig to peer.StaticCollectionConfig since the collection config is a peer concept and really should never have lived in common (this would also leave peer.ApplicationPolicy as is and still prevent an import cycle as long as nothing in common imports StaticCollectionConfig which there isn't anything that does).

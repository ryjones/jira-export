CDATA This epic contains links to new tasks required for system testing v1.2, one task per JIRA testcase, each with fixVersion=v1.2.  Other "platform/tool development epics" contain workitems to provide functionalities needed for executing testcases in this epic. For example, refer to FAB-2247 PTE development, where the required tasks have fixVersion=v1.2.  Note: The system testcases that were executed in earlier releases and which we will run again in this release are described in other epics, one per system test category.  For reference, the V1.2 Dashboard is  https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10701 . It shows a table of all the system testcases and workitems required in this release.  The V1.2 Release Plan features are described here:    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1prtMkLOkZZx7RYi_meb-3yY6lgFhISLQtx8AcSMDhdo/edit   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Current orderer readme is outdated, and most of the content are covered in our docs already. I think it could removed, or replaced with some simple writeup, like "Orderer: This module provides the service that assigns total order to transactions with finality" or similar.  wdyt  ~joe-alewine   ~jyellick   ></description> </Issue>

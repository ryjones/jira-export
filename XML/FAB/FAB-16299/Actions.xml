CDATA 1) The above error is observed from the builds after this CR mergeÂ  FABN-1320  Fix git_tag.sh  2) I see build.gradle is having different code for getting `version` from different branches, which doesn't work.  These changes were made on release-1.4 ( FABN-1320  Fix git_tag.sh) and please make these changes in all branches, CI script tries to pull `version` while publishing jar's to nexus from a common script (include-raw-publish-image-jar.sh).  ></body> </Action>

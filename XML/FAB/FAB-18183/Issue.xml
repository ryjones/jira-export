CDATA Currently, the sphinx version are not consistent between `docs/requirements.txt` and `docs/Pipfile` *  requirements.txt ** sphinx version: v1.7.2 ** This file is supposed to be used to build the docs on ReadTheDocs * Pipfile ** sphinx version: v1.8.5 ** This file is referred to by `docs/source/docs_guide.md` to build the docs locally.     I think the versions for local and ReadTheDocs build should be unified to avoid problems due to version differences.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~sanchezl   ~kchristidis  - What's the status / game plan here?  I recall that a design doc was in progress as were some experiments?    1) Allowing people to prune Kafka logs - do we feel this is now safe?  OSN code changes needed? 2) Pruning the OSN file ledgers - this entails more work for sure  I'm going to move this out to 1.3.  If any part of this fits within the 1.2 development cycle, we can reconsider     ></body> </Action>

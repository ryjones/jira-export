CDATA As a tester, I would like to know a quick way to start up a fabric blockchain network, so I can test it with existing tools or with my own tool. I may wish to write and/or test my own chaincode, and need to quickly spin up a network. Or, I may wish to add tests to the fabric repository, including how to add my own project's chaincode framework.  Tools and readme files are being written inside fabric/test/ directory structure; let's provide in the  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html  a list of the things that can be done easily, along with links to those directories readme files.  ></description> </Issue>

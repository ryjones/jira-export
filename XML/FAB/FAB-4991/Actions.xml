CDATA  ~mastersingh24 , thisÂ got assigned to me but looks like should be  ~harsha544  's as he has a fix in  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11123  where you propose it be fixed later.  The fix is consistent with other cases where we use "latest" and not "x86_64-1.0.0-rc1" tag in the docker compose file.

CDATA Hi  ~AdnanChoudhury ,  No, I have no plans to do that. A sample application should be self sufficient. His comment is about duplication of the assets citing that it creates more maintenance over head. Here is my rational for keeping it this way -  Normally, the data files rarely change so the maintenance argument will rarely apply. Also changing the data files for one project would impact both so in a way it is better to have a copy. Some times too much sharing create more problems then it solves. Nevertheless, if required it can be done as a separate change set. I would need more mods to a working tree to accomodate this suggestion (with which I am not convinced in the first place).   Including the typescript folder inside the javascript folder is also not appropriate as then the users looking for typescript example will not see it. Also the typescript sample (at present) is a rough port of the javascript sample however it does not need to be and should have its own evolution and guidelines.   Regards  Kapil     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ksachdeva  Thanks for the detailed explanation of your rationale.  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   ~jimthematrix  What is your opinion?   ~AdnanChoudhury  is attempting to use the sample in system tests therefore a final decision is required for the sample approach.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA update the gerrit patch set with all the downstream job results. This improves user experience while checking the result of the patch. In the existing approach, we show only aggregated build result with +1 or -1 and in the history we display all the triggered job results with Success or failure. But this is confusing user to see which job is failed for the specific patchset.  Proposed approach: After trigger all the build jobs, the job result should display on gerrit patch set with  fabric-verify-x86_64 SUCCESS  fabric-behave-x86_64 SUCCESS  fabric-verify-s390x SUCCESS  fabric-e2e-tests-x86_64 FAILURE  ></description> </Issue>

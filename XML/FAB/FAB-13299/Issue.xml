CDATA If we onboard a new OSN, and crash in the middle, we start with a ledger that has some blocks, in some channels.  The onboarding phase, has to fetch all blocks in order to verify the hash chain and verify the blocks, but we should skip committing blocks that we already committed before.  The alternative, is to always delete the entire ledger prior to onboarding.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the operational service allow setting logging specs.  However, after the node restarts, the setting will lose and restore to the default level.  There are several ways to achieve the persistence of the setting:  a. Store as local configurations, i.e., core.yaml;  b. Store as separate config for the operational service, which will be used by other operational settings, too;  c. Store into environment variables.  ></description> </Issue>

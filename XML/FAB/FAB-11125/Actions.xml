CDATA  ~mastersingh24  Any response to the above?  To my mind, the old eventhub is a bug.  It doesn't function correctly, and by design never really will.  Any 'serious' clients are already using the newer APIs to get around the old behavior, so I think removing in v1.3 is fine.  Regardless, we should do this early in v1.3 if it's going to be done.  ></body> </Action>

It does this multiple times for the same identity, even within the same policy.  This is amplified when mulitiple policies must be evaluated for the same signature set.  Instead, the signature set should have the identities deserialized once, and then passed into the policy framework." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-06-13 15:00:56.0" updated="2021-04-16 19:13:19.0" resolutiondate="2021-04-16 19:13:19.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="42915"/>

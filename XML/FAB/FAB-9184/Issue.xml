CDATA Running "make linkcheck" generates numerous "redirect" diagnostics, almost all of which are simply translations from "http://" to "https://", so might as well make those changes in the .rst files to remove all that clutter from the output.  There are still other link issues, such as broken links, but that's for another patch â€“ this patch is strictly for basic redirect warnings.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA With the move to GitHub, many, many more people are contributing, especially around documentation updates. The Doc team struggles with the fact that many people make the changes via the GitHub UI for which there is no automated procedure for signing off their commits. The DCO-bot provides very basic instructions in the event, but the problem is its hidden on the `Checks` tab under `DCO` and the instructions assume the change was created on the CLI and you have access to the branch locally.  We should create a simple GitHub action to verify the signoff exists for all commits, and if it does not exist, comment on the PR with how to fix the signoffs and push the changes as well as add the `dco-signoff-required` tag.  ></description> </Issue>

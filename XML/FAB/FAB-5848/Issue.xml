CDATA In gossip, when logs are in DEBUG level - the pull digest message is logged. Identities are replicated via pull (as well) and the digest that is printed is printed in gibberish, since the digest is hash(identity bytes).  We can't make the computation of the digest be different since that would remove compatibility with v1.0.x, but we can at least make the digests of identities be printed not in gibberish.  ></description> </Issue>

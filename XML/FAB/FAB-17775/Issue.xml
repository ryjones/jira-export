CDATA Since the implementation of New() to create a ConfigTx, we should do a walkthrough of all the tests to ensure we're using it and not directly creating the struct via: 			  {code:go} c := &ConfigTx{ 	original: config, 	updated:  config, } {code}  This will ensure we're testing the expected functionality as expected. For example, I noticed this when trying to understand the expected functionality of the AnchorPeers() getter function that the original config was being updated when adding an anchor peer, which I did not expect.      ></description> </Issue>

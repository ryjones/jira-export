CDATA This still in discussion.. After recent updates, now Fabric docs are building on RTD with new Sphinx theme. RTD (readthedocs) only supports github.. RTD build process doesn't support gerrit requests. I see two ways we can implement this  1) Run CI job to execute "make" from docs folder and copy all html files to a hosting documentation server ( Question: 1) who will provide this? 2) It's difficult to maintain multiple copies in hosting site for every patch.  2) Ask committer to verify the documentation build before submit patch and check the documentation output is passed as per new theme.   ~bmos299  any inputs?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~bmos299  I have made changes to CI script to publish docs to gh-pages.. This approach overrides existing files on github repo. couple of observations here:  1) we have to forcibly update staging git hub account every time 2) We can not sync staging and production github in sync with the above process 3) update staging environment for every verify request is a big process and not suitable in this case. RTD will have only one reference URL to refer document changes.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rameshthoomu   ~nickgaski   ~ibmmark   Let me see if I understand this one... 1.  Everything works fine for code merged to master 2.  This Task is pertinent to the verify process using a staging environment.   The item is that the url to the staging environment will be the same and could result in one .rst file overlaying/regression a previous one.  This only applies to the verify process and the viewing by the reviewers/maintainers may not provide the actual .rst file.  I think the chances of this are really slim and the actual merged code is never impacted.  I don't think we need to spend too much time on this one.  The actual .rst will still be in the PR and can be reviewed, regardless if a regression occurred.  Is this true?  If there is not a quick fix for this, I think the risk is greater than a complex fix as we never break the build or the community doc.  ></body> </Action>

We need a verify build that writes to nexus to a CR-specific staging location that the submitter or reviewer can check. For the merge job, we can let RTD host etc as we have now.  ~bmos299   ~rameshthoomu   ~nickgaski   ~markparz " created="2017-04-13 16:21:21.0" updateauthor="christopherferris" updated="2017-04-13 16:21:21.0"/>

CDATA As mentioned in the Rocket chat, I would like to add a new job in fabric to generate the RTD formatted doc output and display on jenkins console. Please access the HTML report out put here (In sandbox for test purpose)  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/doc-test/HTML_Report/ |https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/doc-test/HTML_Report/   This saves lot of document writers time.. Just submit a patch and verify the result on jenkins console.  ></body> </Action>

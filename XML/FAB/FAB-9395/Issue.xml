CDATA Current State  ...'A distinct endorsement policy for *install and instantiate* transactions is also required.'...    Elli Androulaki 9:12 AM I am not sure what install and instantiate a transaction means. If these refer to the corresponding chaincode, then i would say that there is no installation function invoked via a transaction through the ledger. Installation is a local operation.   Jason Yellick 10:05 AM +1, though this is outside the scope of this CR, but install is a local operation and has no endorsement policy.        ></description> </Issue>

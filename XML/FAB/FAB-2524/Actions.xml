CDATA  ~ghaskins  {{Only the specification provided at install() time would generally be considered correct.}} Agreed... and we should not have to need to send chaincode when doing instantiate.  I think I know what's happening. Will work on this today and update by EOD.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~greg.haskins  The CLI actually sends the instantiate without the CodePackage set. I also tried without the path as well. So the following command works in CLI  {code:java} peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args": "init","a","100","b","200" }' {code}   Having said that it is true that it is important to make sure that code provided in {{instantiate}} is not used.   The right way to do that is to not overload ChaincodeDeploymentSpec but use it only for {{install}}.  Propose for now we add a check during endorsement to return an error if CodePackage is set in ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for {{instantiate}} and {{upgrade}}.  Let me submit a CR with that for review.  ></body> </Action>

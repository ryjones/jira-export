Aside from the appropriateness of using a deployment-spec for this API, there is the additional issue that we need to use the proper deployment-spec.  Only the specification provided at install() time would generally be considered correct.  This means we either need to force our clients to formulate a correct CDS, or worse, we operate blindly without one.  This materializes in odd ways, such as forcing the chaincodePath to be set, or instantiating a CAR type payload but ending up with a GOLANG payload instead (since this is the default)" priority="1" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-02-28 02:53:38.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:11:50.0" resolutiondate="2017-03-05 02:33:46.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="37622"/>

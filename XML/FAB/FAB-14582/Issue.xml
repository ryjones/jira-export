CDATA In response to FAB-10416 a script was added to check that the Go version being used is supported but the check wants the exact same major version when it should merely check for a recent enough version, allowing for newer one. Although possible, it is unlikely that a newer version will be backwards incompatible and prevent building successfully.  This makes the build unnecessarily fail using go1.12: {code:java} $ make ERROR: go1.11.x is required to build Fabric. Please update your Go installation: https://golang.org/dl/ make: ***  check-go-version  Error 2 $ go version go version go1.12 darwin/amd64{code}  ></description> </Issue>

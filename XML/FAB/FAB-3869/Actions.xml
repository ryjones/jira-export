CDATA So, I am not familiar with our CI/CD, but I am ready to get going on this. If you'd like, I can quickly pull together a demo and pull down and scan all of the existing projects so that you can see the output. We can then discuss 1) desired changes, 2) workflow that meets our process, and 3) integration with CI and new code check-ins.      Once we get to item 3, we can always design in the logic to make this a gating function if we'd like. I don't recommend it in the beginning.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ashutosh_kumar , you're right. It does not support Go. I would have to look into incorporating that into Anteater or how to use a different tool. I will look into that.   As for arranging a demo, I will try to set something up for this week. Is there a preference for a day and/or time?  ~jasondotstar .   Also,  ~ChristopherFerris , I will work with them on the pipeline.

<Action id="37943" issue="26340" author="wlahti" type="comment" body="I discussed this issue with  ~manish-sethi , since the deliver service waits for a ledger iterator to return the next block before sending. This iterator currently returns on the peer when the block storage has the new block instead of when the state db has it, which is what the queries are performed against. Manish plans to handle the fix. " created="2018-01-03 19:06:24.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2018-01-03 19:06:24.0"/>

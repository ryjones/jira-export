CDATA There are sbft-related artifacts in the the top-level orderer package that do not belong there.  I was told that they were allowed in there temporarily until some sbft-related work was completed, but it's been a couple of months now, and as we're finalizing the work for v1.0 we should expedite this clean up.  Specifically, the following needs to go:  # "genesis" section in orderer.yaml file: this holds deprecated settings simply for sbft - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/orderer.yaml#L173 # "sbft_test.go" and "network_test.go" in "fabric/orderer": both of them are sbft-related and don't belong in the top-level orderer package.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to be able to update the channel creation policy value in a consortium.  We don't support configuring it at channel creation time because it governs the validation of the channel creation request so allowing the channel create tx to set the value would defeat the point; however, we want to be able to allow consumers to update this value on config updates. Note that this is not a ConfigPolicy but rather a ConfigValue in a specific consortium group.  Â   *Acceptance*  I can call the function to update the default channel creation policy value in an existing config. An example should be added to the example_test as well.  ></description> </Issue>

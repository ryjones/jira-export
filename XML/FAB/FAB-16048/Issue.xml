CDATA Would appreciate your feedback on the below: * The documentation of Hyperledger Fabric currently exemplifies the possible key management tools as HSM only, while there are various tools out there. * Promoting a vendor agnostic and technology agnostic approach, I would like to incorporate a pointer to MPC based vHSM technology as well. * Being fully transparent, Unbound Tech, of which I'm an employee, has such a (FIPS 140 L2 certified) vHSM product. However, the vendor name would *not* be promoted. Just the fact that there are various, certified, ways to protect keys.  ----------------  Example places in the documentation where HSM is mentioned: *  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/wallet.html?highlight=hsm  *  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/tutorial/commercial_paper.html?highlight=hsm  *  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/connectionoptions.html?highlight=hsm   Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~RebeccaAspler  To be clear, the docs list things that Fabric supports out of the box ... not what *might* be possible.  That being said, technically we should be talking about PKCS11 rather than "HSM" as what Fabric really supports is the use of PKCS11 compliant crypto modules.  Do you have some suggested text you'd like to use?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Here are some suggested edits:  For  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/wallet.html?highlight=hsm  - Change the diagram to have a "HSM/vHSM" block - Change the HSM description to: - (virtual) Hardware Security Module: A wallet stored in an HSM or vHSM. An HSM is an ultra-secure, tamper-proof device that stores digital identity information, particularly private keys. HSMs can be locally attached to your computer or network accessible. Most HSMs provide the ability to perform on-board encryption with private keys, such that the private key never leave the HSM. A vHSM is software that provides that same ultra-secure environment as an HSM, but has the flexibility of software to provide enhancements and updates without hardware changes.  Other locations should change HSM to "HSM/vHSM" or to "(virtual) Hardware Security Module".

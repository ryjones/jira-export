CDATA Today we execute the upgrade test by going from 1.4 -> 2.0 -> 2.1  We need to update the test to perform two scenarios: * 1.4 -> 2.0 -> 2.1 -> 2.2 * 1.4 -> 2.2  Of note is that the 1.4 -> 2.2 upgrade will no longer require the user to drop the database when using couchdb. If the upgrade scenario doesn't use couchDB, it should be modified to us couch.  This test should be modified to run daily and only executed on the master branch.  Acceptance criteria: A daily job runs two upgrades scenarios, one to across all releases since the last LTS release, and one that runs from the last LTS directly to the newest LTS.  ></description> </Issue>

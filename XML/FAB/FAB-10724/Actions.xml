CDATA Copying  ~jyellick 's comment from the gerrit CR:  "The user will need to include the hash of the chaincode in the voting portion of lifecycle as well as in the definition step. Although we can/should return the hash to the user at install time, if they install a chaincode, discard this hash value, and later wish to work with it, they can query the peer to get this hash value."  ></body> </Action>

CDATA FAB-10720 introduces a way to persist chaincode packages onto the filesystem and FAB-10723Â introduces a way to retrieve those packages by hash.  However, users may not know the hash of their installed chaincode by may only know the friendlier name/version. In this case, we will need to be able to look up the hash by name/version. Once the correct hash is known, the existing API for retrieving the code bytes themselves may be used.  The implementation should accept name/version as parameters, and return a byte slice which is the hash.  ></description> </Issue>

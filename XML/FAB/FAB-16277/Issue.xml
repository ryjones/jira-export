CDATA Same problem as FAB-14268 - the 5 orderers created when you start BYFN w/ Raft: - All have different hostnames inside the Docker network (orderer, orderer2, ..., orderer5)  - All have the same port inside the Docker network (7050) - All have different ports outside the Docker network (7050, 8050, ..., 11050)  The configuration blocks contain the hostnames and ports inside the Docker network, and this is the information the SDKs use to access those ordering nodes. The Node.js SDK, when running outside the Docker network, can be configured to force the hostnames to localhost - but this means such applications just see 5 orderers all with a hostname of localhost and a port of 7050.   This requires the same fix as FAB-14268 - make the orderers use the same port inside and outside the Docker network - so this problem doesn't occur.  ></description> </Issue>

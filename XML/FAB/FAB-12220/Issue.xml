CDATA +*Setup:*+  Network Topology: 1 channel, 3 org, 2 peers per org, each peer with CouchDB container for stateDB, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 2 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels. Client Driver: PTE +*Test Steps:*+ 1) chaincode: each channel has one chancode, marbles02_private go chaincode, instantiated.  ORG1 and ORG2 in private collection policy and ORG3 not in collection policy.  2)transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 1000 invokes concurrently with tx id from 1 to 1000           thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer2 on channel 1          thread 4 sends to org2 peer2 on channel 1  3) Concurrently, do  4000 invokes transactions (similar to previous step, using 4 threads each sending 1000 new invokes, starting with index 4000) 4000 private data queries, on all peers in all orgs (similar to previous step, using 4 threads each sending 1000 queries)  The Queries sent to ORG3 should fail.     +*Result*+ 1)hardware setup 2) RPS (request per second) achieved for queries 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers and CouchDB containers  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Since the ports used by NetworkLauncher were changed a few days ago, we are seeing OTE tests fail. OTE tests use the NL, so we need to change the ports expected/used by OTE too. There are connection failures when trying to connect to orderers, since OTE is  using different port than NL. Also, the ote.go code panics due to an index error, so we can fix that to produce a useful error message (and then panic "gracefully").  {{Started client Consumer-o0-c2 to recv delivered batches srvr=orderer0.example.com:5005 chID=testorgschannel3 Got DeliverResponse_Status: &\{NOT_FOUND} panic: runtime error: index out of range goroutine 44  running : github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE.startConsumer(0xc42056a380, 0x19, 0xc420461fc0, 0x10, 0x1, 0x0, 0xc42056bf40, 0xc42056bf20, 0xc4205aa640, 0xfffffffffffffffe, ...) /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE/ote.go:335 +0x14f4 created by github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE.ote /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE/ote.go:1239 +0x1b17 exit status 2        FAIL        github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE        8.075s}}  ></description> </Issue>

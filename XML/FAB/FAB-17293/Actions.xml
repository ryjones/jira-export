CDATA Thanks  ~luckyrobinson  to bring this up. This logic was completely removed in master. There was a discussion whether we should have removed this in 1.4 itself but then was deferred to 2.0 ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/32449/2/core/ledger/ledgerstorage/store.go@348|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/32449/2/core/ledger/ledgerstorage/store.go@348). )  Still, to minimize the changes in 1.4, we can simply remove this line -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/a8639bacd3e3516ee77fad3bdf00110710ae7cd9/core/ledger/ledgerstorage/store.go#L146|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/a8639bacd3e3516ee77fad3bdf00110710ae7cd9/core/ledger/ledgerstorage/store.go#L146)   Â    ~Senthil1  - wdyt?  ></body> </Action>

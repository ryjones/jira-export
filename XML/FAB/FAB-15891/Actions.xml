CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   Â   1) Would it be incorrect to say version 8.9.x or higher is supported? 2) Per Mari's question do we also need to tell them they can upgrade their existing node projects to use node 10 with the fabric sdk? 3) And should we say specifically version 10.16.0 or just 10.x.x?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA maybe something like ... node.js version 8 is supported from 8.9.4 and higher and version 10 is supported from 10.15.3 and higher. I think by saying we support version 10, we are saying they can upgrade to 10 if they wish.  ></body> </Action>

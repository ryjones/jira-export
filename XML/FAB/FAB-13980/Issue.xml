CDATA SDKs: using different chaincode language from SDK interface  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I use the <NodeJS SDK/Java SDK> interface And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel And an admin builds a chaincode package from path "<path>" using lang "<lang>" And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000 When a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "invoke","a","b","10"  And I wait "5" seconds When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 990 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

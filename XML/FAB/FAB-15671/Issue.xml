CDATA PTE must read in separate connection profiles yaml files, potentially one for each org, in the same fabric network, from the ConnProfilePath directory. It must treat them together as one network, as if all the pieces were part of one network, when generating traffic based on the traffic config parameters.  As part of this, the hardcoded 'test-network' should be made a variable. Refer also to comments in a previous code review: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-test/+/31727/6..8/tools/PTE/pte-execRequest.js#b232  Also, address this comment too: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-test/+/31727/6..8/tools/PTE/pte-util.js#174   ></description> </Issue>

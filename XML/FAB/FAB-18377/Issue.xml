CDATA Hello everyone, i dont know if this is the intended behaviour or a bug but, lets say you have 2 organizations each one with a private data collection set up to:    {code:java} "memberOnlyRead": true, "memberOnlyWrite": true, {code}  They have access to their own collection but not the other orgs collection, they cant query or write on the other org collection either. What i would expect from setting these parameters to true is that there is no access from org1 to org 2 collection and vice versa. What i dont understand that org1 can delete private data from org2, this is shown in fabric samples asset transfer secured agreement  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/asset-transfer-secured-agreement/chaincode-go/asset_transfer.go#L372   i replicated this using node sdk and chaincode too. i dont understand and it is not explained anywere, is this behaviour intended?        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi,  I managed to run Hyperledger/Fabric at scale with docker swarm on the cluster. In this scenario, the new node can join the network when we scale up, and some will leave when we scale down.  *Thing is that* The running nodes have it list of "Discovery nodes", which is never be updated (if I'm right). Since the peer know the full list, then it try to communicate to the other nodes on the list, at which some may not come back anymore. Even this shows the annoying ERROR on the log, but it has no problem with any later invokes.  Please see the attached file. I'm running with DEBUG mode, that's why I can see this message.  *Questions* Should we still keep the full discovery list? Should we update the list for keeping only it's active member? Is this the issue?, please let me know.   ></description> </Issue>

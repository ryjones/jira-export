CDATA This actually is a bug in that: 1) the error message is wrong, 2) one should be able to ask for the help or version independently of whether the config file is found.  #1 actually comes from a bug in Viper which is fixed in the latest version  Â Upgrading the vendor'ed Viper and dependencies gives the following: {code:java} .build/bin/peer version 2018-07-13 17:08:18.573 CEST  main  main -> ERRO 001 Fatal error when initializing core config : error when reading core config file: Config File "core" Not Found in " /Users/lehors/Projects/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric "   {code} Can we please do at least that so that users aren't left confused?  Once I have figured out our policy on updating vendored packages I will submit a CR. Then I will be investigating #2 :)  ></body> </Action>

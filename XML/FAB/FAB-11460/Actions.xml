CDATA I think .Net SDK and .Net shim for chaincode is a great idea. It should make it easier for the .Net developer community to leverage Fabric.  I assume the pre-reqs for the runtime listed here are accurate?   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x   You mention Visual Studio 2017 as an IDE. I assume Visual Studio Code ( 1.2.x or later ) will work also as an IDE in Linux?  Thanks        ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~jmason900   yes, the pre-reqs for the runtime are accurate. And it's working so far with the docker fabric-ccenv modified by me within the repository.  Developing is possible with every code editor you want, preferably (by me): JetBrains Rider (Linux, macOS, Windows), Visual Studio Code (also all three platforms) or Visual Studio (Windows only). So there's enough freedom of choice to use any editor someone wants. :)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello, i already ported the Fabric SDK from Java.  https://github.com/maxpiva/fabric-sdk-net   The shim is also ported.  https://github.com/maxpiva/fabric-chaincode-net   v1.1 is working as expected and v1.3 is coming nicely.  but my proficiency and knowledge on GO is almost Zero, so i need some help on that part (Platform, and docker creation).     ></body> </Action>

Help on fabric, and some guidelines will be really appreciated.

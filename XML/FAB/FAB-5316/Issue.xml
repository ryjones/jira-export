CDATA A chaincode installation request is relayable. This means that when a peer receives an cc installation request can simply submit this request to other peers of the same organisation and extend the availability of this chaincode to peers who are not supposed to have this chaincode installed.  Solution: *bind*Â chaincode installation request, as well as other request to their intended recipient.  ></description> </Issue>

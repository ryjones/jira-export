CDATA Currently system chaincodes (other than lscc) are unable to persist state to the ledger since validation fails with the following error:    txvalidator  GetInfoForValidate -> ERRO 34e Unable to get chaincode data from ledger for txid xxxxx, due to lscc's state for  xxxscc  not found.  This is because system chaincode instantiations are not stored in LSCC.  For system chaincodes, the chaincode data should be declared in the System Chaincode registry. This data will also include the Policy so that chaincode policies can be validated. This chaincode data will obviously be global across all channels.    ></description> </Issue>

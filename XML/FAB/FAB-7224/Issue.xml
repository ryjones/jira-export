CDATA Enhance custom tx processor support in ledger such that when the custom tx processor is invoked with a transaction, it is aware whether the transaction is getting in an online processing or as a part of the ledger initialization. Here ledger initialization refers to two situations 1) constructing ledger from genesis block and 2) replaying the transactions from block storage in the event of a restart of peer after system crash such that the crash left the statedb in an inconsistent state in respect to the block storage.  During ledger initialization, it is guaranteed to pass only valid transactions to the processor and hence it can skip any validations. On the other hand, More importantly, this enhancement would be useful for situation where the processor is to consult some structure in the peer memory which could not be available during ledger initialization.  ></description> </Issue>

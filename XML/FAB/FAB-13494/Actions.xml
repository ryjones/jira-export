CDATA This error occurs because the Jenkins plugin is unable to read the generated xml file at line 939. This occurs when the error that is generated has unicode characters that the plugin does not recognize.  There are some test failures that with certain chaincodes (such as enccc_example.go) that display details of the failures. We can decrease the information that is stored in the output. By doing so, we also lose some post-run debug data. In this specific example, the install failed and the details from every step up to the point of failure is included in the error message.  As a first pass, I'll have the debug written as a string instead of unicode.   The offending xml file has been included in the issue. Note line 939, the offending line.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Functions in the integration package should be executing command lines tools - not performing assertions against them.  UpdateOrdererConfig and CreateChannel should be modified to support success and failure cases by returning the session post-exit. The caller can then assert on the exit code and/or stdout/stderr.  ></description> </Issue>

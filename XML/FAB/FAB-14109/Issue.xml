CDATA When the initial deploy is done using the new chaincode lifecycle and an attempt to redeploy the chaincode using the new lifecycle, an error occurred that stated that the chaincode already existed - despite changing the name and version on the chaincode.  It should be noted, for this upgrade attempt there was a change in the chaincode name and version, but the code was identical. The install failed with an identical hash error. {code}Error: install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not save cc install package: chaincode metadata already exists at /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/730045c6268d8b4dc31800b0bee475b3c9776d59734f91ac8e130b03d4a025c5.json{code}  - Expected that the change in version and name would be sufficient for a new hash to be generated.   ></description> </Issue>

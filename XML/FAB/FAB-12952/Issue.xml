CDATA Payload logging is very, very verbose. While we want a way to turn on it in the rare cases it is needed, given the amount of stuff we have at the debug level, it's not really feasible to use that level for payload as well.  One way to address this is to use use a custom log level for payload.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Code thatÂ is been removed from the tree can result in unused dependencies and we have recently seen this.  This condition can be detected in CI by running `dep ensure --no-vendor --dry-run` during the linting phase. If dead dependencies are discovered, the build would fail and the commit would need to be ammended to remove the unused dependency.  ></description> </Issue>

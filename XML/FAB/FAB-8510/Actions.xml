CDATA  ~nileshdeotale  I believe this works - but you need to clone the master branch of fabric-samples.  By default, git clone clones the release branch.  Unless we plan to deprecate the `-m` option, maybe we should put it back in the docs? In any case, we'll need to make sure that we are cloning the right version of fabric-samples  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I confirmed release branch fabric-samples requires -m option.  Master branch works either with or without the -m.  I believe -m was removed from the docs so that we could reduce the baggage going forward.  I assume we will have a release-1.1.x branch for both fabric and fabric-samples, and that it will become the default.  In that case I think we're good with how the docs are now (no -m option needed).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  I believe it was  ~lehors  who made this change as part of the work to refactor the sample so the CLI container can be used correctly.  However, should we do this ?  The "-m" is not needed now...its just left there if someone runs old scripts. At some point we do have to remove the '-m' from docs. Why not now ?

CDATA By the way, we're bringing a lot more changes to byfn, like -p and upgrade. Are we not going to have these in the doc because they won't work with older version of the script? I think not. So, let's keep things in perspective here.  People do need to look at the documentation that matches the version they use. That's a fact. Maybe we should work on making that clearer in the doc, with a banner or something so that people would not get confused. That would seem a better solution than singling out one particular change.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="40848" issue="27997" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="Appreciate the comments Arnaud.  I too was on the fence on this one, but ultimately confusion is one of our largest enemies and therefore I&apos;m in favor of keeping things consistent across releases (like use of -m flag), unless there is compelling reason to change.  Certainly we can add new optional flags where it is important, but we&apos;d like to keep the core sample functioning consistent, as this is the on ramp for many users for each release." created="2018-02-26 17:20:28.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-02-26 17:20:28.0"/>

CDATA As currently we only have chain.queryBlockByNumber(), but sometimes we might need to go through all the block sequentially to check all data (e.g. build a data warehouse from the data), and query only one block at a time is too inefficient for that.  The alternate approach within chaincode GetStateByRange() does not work well for scanning all keys, since you would have to continuously re-scan to find key changes.  It would be better to be able to get blocks by block range and process all changes from the block transaction write sets.  For example get blocks 1-100, then 101-200, etc.  Would prefer a peer API than a chaincode API, since the query is not a contract.  This would imply a peer API and a corresponding SDK API.  ></description> </Issue>

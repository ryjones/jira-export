CDATA In gossip when a peer obtains an AliveMessage from a peer it hasn't received its certificate yet - it complains in the log in WARNING that it has received a message from some peer it can't verify its identity.  This is actually a common scenario where a peer is restarted and its in-meory certificate store is now empty, but the other peers contact the peer and send it alive messages which he can't verify until it syncs its certificates with them.  This startles users and I think we should reduce the logging severity from WARN to DEBUG.  ></description> </Issue>

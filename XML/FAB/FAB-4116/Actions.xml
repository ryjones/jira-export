CDATA I don't believe that this falls into David's category 3 as documented in the wiki   https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/release_exit_criteria  There are three broad categories of change that will be considered to be merged: #  Changes that do not affect production code. This includes documentation, new or improved tests, bug fixes to non production code #  Bug fixes that affect production code, but which have minimally complex changes #  Changes that affect production code but which have a more complex resolution  Changes that belong to the first two categories will be reviewed and merged provided they meet the criteria: *  the CR identifies the associated JIRA item in its title *  the JIRA item is complete in its description of the problem and the resolution, and is appropriately labeled, categorized and identifies the current release in _Affects Version/s_ and the pending release in _Fix Version/s_ *  the CR has test coverage for the defect being resolved (as appropriate) and the documentation is updated accordingly as needed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In fabric-test, we are developing new launcher (network client), operator, and testdriver (test client) using networkSpec and testSpec input files. We should run a test as part of the CI verify job in fabric-test repo. Pull fabric images and binaries to do it. The main goal is to verify our tools work. Add to the "make ci-smoke" target. * Add a "smoke test" to fabric-test verify job, using new launcher (locally), with new small networkSpec file, confirm the connprofile generated, and the healthcheck passes (launcher does this automatically).Â  * From runSmokeTestSuite.sh, execute a golang test driver, not python, to run this new test with new golang launcher and operator tools. * This piece could also be used for interop testsuite, so refer to FAB-16719 for network config details.  We may want to open separate tasks for additional pieces: * Add and use a simple testSpec pteinput file to create, join, install, instantiate, updateanchor, invoke, query, and a healthcheck. * Instead of install and instantiate, or in addition, we may want to use the new lifecycle functions (yet to be developed in the Operator and in PTE), e.g. something like package, approve, commit. * Finally, add test steps for more functions as they are added. Consider items like upgradecc, configupdate, queryblockheights and compare in all peers (2 orgs with 1 peer), and fetch ledger heights or the final TX from all (1 or 3) raft orderers.  ></description> </Issue>

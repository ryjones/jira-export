CDATA Both of those actually seem familiar.   ~vijaypunugubati  Did you create bug for the first one? I expect you probably saw it while digging through logs for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27768/.   ~rameshthoomu  We've been fighting javaenv issues for awhile now; can you provide any info about the second one?  ></body> </Action>

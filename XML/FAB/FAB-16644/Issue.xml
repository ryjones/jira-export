CDATA This is a preliminary version of fab-16259, to get an automated test running with the systest suite now. Migrate a kafka-based network to raft: the test driver should call operator.sh to invoke existing migration scripts. No traffic running in parallel, since that capability is not available yet in the new testdriver tooling being developed.  (Later, fab-16259 will be used to migrate, with traffic running, and by using the testSpec input file to specify the channel reconfig action and other steps.)  ></description> </Issue>

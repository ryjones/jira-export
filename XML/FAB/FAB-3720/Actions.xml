Probably if it&apos;s wort considering to return a table format with all chaincode and have a status field with information of chaincode being installed/instantiated.

I&apos;m working on add chaincode stop/start func to disable/enable chaincode on channel. The status of chaincode was reserved to describe the stop/start status.   Return table format sounds great. Now most CLIs returns results with logs. Perhaps we could consider standardlizing all outputs of CLI." created="2017-08-23 08:22:28.0" updateauthor="jiangyaoguo" updated="2017-08-23 08:22:28.0"/>

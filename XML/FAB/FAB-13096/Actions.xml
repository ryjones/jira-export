CDATA  ~jyellick   ~yacovm  Any suggestions/tips here to guide the work? e.g. would it be better to add the anchor peer with the Org3 config transaction? Or configure anchor peer in subsequent config transaction?   ~pandrejko   ~joe-alewine  FYI  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="54240" issue="35783" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="+1  ~yacovm , it&apos;s generally natural that the anchor peer update would be performed as a discrete step from the addition of the org.  Adding an org to a channel is a decision of a quorum of members, adding an anchor peer for an org si a decision of that org." created="2018-12-04 06:04:55.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2018-12-04 06:04:55.0"/>

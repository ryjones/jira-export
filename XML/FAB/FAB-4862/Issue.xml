CDATA Calling Invoke Transaction in a loop continuously doesn't work.  We are using Fabric Alpha Images - x86_64-1.0.0-alpha.  Our topology is like One orderer (SOLO), 2 orgs with 2 peers each, similar to what we have in e2e Samples. We use LevelDB.  We are calling the Invoke Transaction from Node SDK continuously in a loop for the Bulk Data Load. We tried adding 7 records, the execution of all Txns went fine and we don't see any errors in any of the logs. But during retrieval some records were missing and not persisted.   Our use case is as below:  In one Invoke we make couple of commits in the LevelDB. One for adding the actual entity/asset and the other for maintaining a reference/Index for similar records.  So lets say the 1st Invoke happened successfully and when the second record goes in which is similar to the 1st one, then we retrieve the existing reference record and update it and in the same flow we persist the asset too. These kind of records, though in the logs it says it persisted but we are not able to retrieve it at all from DB.  We can work around this problem if we put sleep time of 15 seconds in between every Invoke, everything happens successfully without any issues. Also we are making sure that when the 1st Invoke is committed to the ledger only then the next one is executed using the Callback mechanism/Promises.     ></description> </Issue>

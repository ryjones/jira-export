CDATA A Token Management System is an abstraction that aims to generalise the set of operations associated to the issuing, transfer and listing of tokens at a relatively lower level. It is essentially a library that can be used by FabToken entities (client, prover peer) to construct the FabToken issue and transfer transactions, to list the tokens owned by a specific user, etc, and to validate/commit FabToken transactions (committing peer side).  In this task we aim to design an interface for a _TMS issuer_ that would compute token issue proofs (low level) and of a _TMS Verifier_ interface that would verify token issue _TMS Issuer_ generated proofs. The task should also provide a mockup implementation of these interfaces.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Did u have to run the pull on the peer or on the host . I have the same issue on windows .   But I have a slightly different way to recreate it :         I have a local checkout on vagrant on windows and I was to create the entire set of local containers and the tests passed        i pushed the images to a local registry and then tried running the tests from a different machine which does not have the sources and the paths are different     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Arguments for 1.0 merge consideration:  Without this patch, the system will not automatically pull the ccenv container when it is not found locally, such as the case when deployed from binary artifacts rather than built from source.  The implications of this are: * Best case, the operator and/or deployment scripts are forced manually pull the image * Worst case, the system is not deployable.  This can happen when using distributed docker orchestration engines (e.g. Kubernetes) because the peer can be run on arbitrary nodes in the network.  ></body> </Action>

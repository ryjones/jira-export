CDATA I'll repeat here the comments I made on the previous ticket that is now closed:  Isn't this missing some task to upload the Getting Started tarballs as well?  This is what wasn't done until Saturday last time around, leaving everybody scrambling trying to get their hands on the script and tarball they needed.  ></body> </Action>

Do you mean they don't necessarily change?  I don't think that this matters. Making sure that the right tarballs and bootstrap.sh script are in place ought to be part of the release process. Otherwise there is no way to guarantee that when people follow the Getting Started doc they will get those pieces right.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA yes this job https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-binaries/ triggers on ref-updated gerrit event.. This happens when a release tag is created.    ~lehors  I did pre-release testing on fabric binaries.. Pushed fabric binary snapshot tar balls to nexus snapshot URL and pulled images from rameshthoomu docker hub account. I tested this on linux-amd64, windows-amd64.. Just do curl this script which is compatible to windows and follow below commands  {code:java} curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rameshthoomu/fabric/patch-2/scripts/bootstrap-1.0.0-alpha3.sh > bootstrap-1.0.0-alpha3.sh chmod +x bootstrap-1.0.0-alpha3.sh ./bootstrap-1.0.0-alpha3.sh cd release/windows-amd64 ./network_setup restart beta 60 {code}  ></body> </Action>

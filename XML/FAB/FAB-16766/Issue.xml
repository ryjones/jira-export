CDATA Combine related tests under integration/ledger to reduce the need of creating a new network and deploying chaincode. * combine reset and rollback tests (with pause/resume) into a single "It" * each test in couchdb_indexes_test has its own way to install and instantiate chaincode; therefore, each test will still need to deploy its own chaincode even if they are combined. Given it, these tests will not be combined.Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The logging.peer option in core.yaml is not used and also gets in the way of overriding the log level for submodules that begin with peer. It should be renamed to logging.level so that it uses the same environment variable naming as CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL.   Note: CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL set as an environment variable still overrides the value set in core.yaml.   ></description> </Issue>

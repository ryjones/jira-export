These are expected to be used by various components that would generate or consume the snapshot files, such as blockstorage and statedb. Also, use these functions for generating the snapshot files for TXIDs." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-05-11 04:12:25.0" updated="2020-05-13 22:23:46.0" resolutiondate="2020-05-13 22:23:46.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="58945" archived="N"/>

CDATA More testing is needed in the area of Service Discovery using the different SDKs. This requires a network to configure to use service discovery and to call a SDK API that indicates that service discovery is in use. Then when 1 peer goes down, it should not cause errors when sending transactions on a channel.   Be sure to test within an organization and across organizations and with different sdks.   Note: there is an API that needs to be called that returns the list of available peers for service discovery.  Questions:  1. Is there a way to set the retry timeout for the clients such that we can verify that a "downed" peer returns an error and a "newly discovered" peer is successful?  ></description> </Issue>

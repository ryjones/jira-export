CDATA Since samples are inherently going to be version specific as we add functionality to fabric releases, we need to make sure that the proper samples are downloaded for a given release.  Our RTD documentation supports multiple versions based on branches and tags. So the doc in master should always point to the master branch of fabric-samples  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I said, that if you want to add methods to the gRPC server, I guess they should be processed in SCC. That's all. Can't you make it that if the peer process dies, the container dies with it?  Also- I don't think that we should expose any requests only to anchor peers, as there is no reason not to do that for all peers, since the information peers with the same circumstances (same channel, same orgs, etc.) is identical to the information anchor peers have.  {quote} so that we can not automatic recover. But I think gossip should get that fail info and update the membership for other peers. {quote} Gossip updates the membership info of peers already. It is part of how it works.  {quote} For this case, if i can get the infomation, i can find out actually one container need restart or remove and add a new one.{quote} Although I see merit in exposing membership information, I don't think this use case is a very good one for using gossip membership - if you have a production environment you should already use some monitoring and auto-failover mechanisms without the help of gossip.

CDATA Assume we use kubernetes or swarm to manage blockchain networks in production. We deploy all peers, orderers, ca using containers/pods, kafka, couchdb as well. After initial deployment, it is better to have a mechanism to detect and recovery failed components.  For fabric e2e example, we have two peer orgs and each org has two peers(one anchor). In normal we will have four containers/pods running. However unfortunate one peer(not anchor) failed, but the container which include it is still running. In this case, only through kubernetes we can not found this problem ASAP so that we can not automatic recover. But I think gossip should get that fail info and update the membership for other peers.   Now that I think if we can expose some APIs to let external side know the membership update. For this case, if i can get the infomation, i can find out actually one container need restart or remove and add a new one.   ~yacovm suggest may add some methods in SCC can help  ~binhn suggest we can expose API to request an anchor peer to return the peers that it gossips with within its org  ~muralisr said it need carefully consider security and privacy  Hope we could discuss here and make sure if it can be implemented and how can do it      ></description> </Issue>

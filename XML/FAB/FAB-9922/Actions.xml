<Action id="43981" issue="29994" author="senthil1" type="comment" body=" ~C0rWin  Good catch. I failed to think about multiple namespaces in the read-write set due to chaincode-calling-chaincode. As each collection config package is stored under a key named `lscc~chaincodeName~collection`, we need to store multiple collection config packages in `TxPvtReadWriteSetWithConfigInfo` as you suggested. We might need to make changes in the unit-test of transient store package accordingly but not the store itself.Â " created="2018-05-07 11:08:06.0" updateauthor="senthil1" updated="2018-05-07 11:08:06.0"/>

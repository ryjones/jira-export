<Action id="60966" issue="40544" author="guoger" type="comment" body=" ~yacovm  i feel this is a rare situation, and as long as we have a way out, i&apos;d avoid adding it to Fabric. Practically people would likely run orderer on unix-like system, and if it&apos;s not, they could copy the data out, start orderer in a container or another linux box, rotate the cert, and resume the service. (in theory they could also assemble an artificial config block and append to file ledger i guess?)" created="2019-06-13 14:10:14.0" updateauthor="guoger" updated="2019-06-13 14:10:14.0"/>

<Action id="60969" issue="40544" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="This seems like a nice recovery option to have to me.  Changing the host time, or intercepting system calls may not be an option in many environments, especially in cloud deployments.  If this can be done in a non-invasive way and without a lot of effort, it could be a very useful field utility." created="2019-06-13 14:51:28.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2019-06-13 14:51:28.0"/>

CDATA I really needed this option before couple of days. We "lock" our production installation because admin certificates expired, and we understood for the problem after this happened. We were unable to update the chaincode or to do config updates.   We were able to recover, but it take us a lot of downtime, a bit of luck, and most importantly, we have total control over the servers. Otherwise, it may be impossible.   Because Fabric usage is growing, I expect more users to hit the same "edge case". The proposed option is a clear recovery mechanism with minimal downtime, and even can be automated.   Many people, even big companies, have troubles managing so many certificates.  Please, implement it. It will not introduce any complexity in the processes, it will not open possible vectors for attack, but can save some one a lot of time, reputation and money.  ></body> </Action>

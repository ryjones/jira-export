CDATA Here is a (possibly partial) list of components which need an update to their unit tests in order to cover the new migration code: * kafka/chain * kafka/consenter * channelconfig/orderer * orderer/multichannel/chainsupport * orderer/multichannel/registrar * etcdraft/chain * solo/chain  Â   This will be updated as the implementation progresses.  Use ginkgo wherever possible / needed.  ></description> </Issue>

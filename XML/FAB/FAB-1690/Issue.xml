CDATA The SBFT orderer does not support multiple chains but it should. This task includes the following: * add a Consenter interface implementation to SBFT (with HandleChain for multichain support) * implement the Chain interface for SBFT * implement all the needed functions in SBFT's internal modules: ** there should be one backend running (backend is the part responsible for handling connections, persistence, ledger write/read...) per orderer peer (replica) ** there should be one SBFT instance per chain ** this means that the same backend can have multiple SBFT instances, e.g. if there are N replicas and M chains at a given moment then there are N backend instances (one for each replica) and N*M SBFT instances (M for each replica) * SBFT should be started using the main app inside _orderer_  ></description> </Issue>

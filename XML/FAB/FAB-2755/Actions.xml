CDATA  ~rameshthoomu   ~Clayton Sims   ~jimthematrix@gmail.com   The root of this was a change in Fabric CA.  This would have been caught much sooner if all our fabric and fabric ca for  integration tests (verify,merge) were pulled from gerrit and not git.  I'have seen the git repo lag gerrit by several commits over a day. BTW is Fabric_ca's verify also running SDK's ITs?  ></body> </Action>

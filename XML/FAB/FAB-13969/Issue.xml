CDATA When defining chaincode for an Org (approveformyorg), when sequence number stays the same, verify that “vote” is not counted when using this multiple times.  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel  And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  When a user queries on the chaincode with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000  When an admin builds chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/example02/cmd" as version "2" with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  with name "mycc2" on all peers And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers  When an admin approves the upgraded chaincode package using sequence "0" on peer "peer0.org1.example.com" When an admin approves the upgraded chaincode package on peer "peer0.org2.example.com" When the organization admins approve the upgraded chaincode package on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel And a user invokes on the chaincode with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  on "peer0.org1.example.com" Then a user receives an error response containing "<Error Message>" {code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This is a cleanup CR which consolidates the mixed references to the old channel config code and the new channel config code.  In general, either reference is simply changed to refer to fabric/common/channelconfig but there are some package names which need cleanup as well.  Although large and scary looking, this is purely rearrangements of imports and package names, no actual code logic is changed in this one.  ></description> </Issue>

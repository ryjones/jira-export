CDATA {quote}the ability to exchange assets using unspent transaction outputs as the inputs for subsequent transactions {quote} That sounds like a copy from bitcoin document. Data in Fabric is modeled like object, which is completely encapsulated by a chaincode; that is, the only way to access the data created by a chaincode is through the chaincode. It is much more low level (flexible) than unspent or spent transactions.   I would suggest change to "the ability to modify assets using chaincode transactions"  ></body> </Action>

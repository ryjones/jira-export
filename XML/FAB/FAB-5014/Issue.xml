CDATA https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric_model.html     Assets Assets can range from the tangible (real estate and hardware) to the intangible (contracts and intellectual property). You can easily define Assets in client-side javascript and use them in your Fabric application using the included Fabric Composer tool.  Fabric supports the ability to exchange assets using unspent transaction outputs as the inputs for subsequent transactions. Assets (and asset registries) live in Fabric as a collection of key-value pairs, with state changes recorded as transactions on a Channel ledger. Fabric allows for any asset to be represented in binary or JSON format.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     This makes it sound like Assets are a central part of Fabric where there is no Asset object at all. I do agree one use of Fabric is to manage Assets – But I could use Fabric in may other other ways such as recording events.   I think this is too limiting in focus.   The sentence on unspent transaction outputs is also extremely confusing not sure what it's meant to communicate.  Also Channel ledger is introduced is this different the just the ledger ?  ></description> </Issue>

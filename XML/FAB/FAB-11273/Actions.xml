CDATA There's not really enough here to guess what might be going on. In addition to the 52 log entries that have been removed before the timeout, the front half of execute is missing.  Can you collect all of the logs and only obfuscate or redact information that can't be shared? Without the front half of the execution processing, it will be nearly impossible to diagnose.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There's not enough information in the partial log. All the log shows is that the handler attempts to send a transaction to escc and doesn't progress. There are two likely causes.  1. channel processing from the in-process stream that connects the chaincode handler to escc is hung up 2. a previous dispatch to escc has not completed and the handler is block on the "serialLock" in the handler  Since the entire log is not attached, neither can be discounted. I also don't know what logging is currently enabled. Some evidence of the first candidate would likely show up in the "inproccontroller" module and issues with the second would be observable with a dump of go routines and my be visible with escc logs and chaincode logging from previous transactions.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are a number of cases where the peer is able to create chaincode containers and then attempts to start them.  However, if the chaincode container fails to communicate with the peer within a specified timeout, the peer considers the deployment to be a failure and will actually attempt to delete the container.   When this happens, access to the container logs is lost and it is difficult to debug what cause the communication error.  It should be possible to use the remote API to retrieve the logs (if they exist) prior to deleting a container.  This would greatly improve usability and help with operations  ></description> </Issue>

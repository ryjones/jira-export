CDATA  ~ChristopherFerris   Edit: Oops, just figured out that the peer dumps the chaincode container's logs to it's own logs, so that gave me the info I needed to debug properly. Sorry for the bother.  -I'm struggling with the exact same problem, the most information I get is that the container exited with code 0 and it all happens in about 1 or 2 seconds so I just cannot type fast enough to do a `docker logs ...` on the terminal because the container gets deleted right away. This is on Fabric v1.4.8.-  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Release - Fabric v1.0.6  Here is the Pen Test finding for the Signing Key generated by Fabric CA Client    {code:java} Key may be vulnerable to wrapping attacks. Consequences: Possible compromise of sensitive keys stored on the HSM. Explanation: Keys generated with CKA_EXTRACTABLE set to CK_TRUE can be wrapped (encrypted) by other keys for transport and backup. There are a number of security issues associated to key wrapping in PKCS#11 to the extend that it is best avoided completely unless absolutely necessary. If an encrypted backup of a key is required, it should be taken immediately using the C_WrapKey function and then the CKA_EXTRACTABLE attribute should be set to CK_FALSE. {code}       ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~denyeart I started the PR here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1120      Can I also remove these sections:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html#node-js-runtime-and-npm    https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html#python   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html#windows-extras  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~pandrejko   The node.js and python info is applicable for Node.js SDK applications, so I agree let's remove from core Fabric prereq doc section and ensure there is coverage in Node.js SDK docs. Let's ask  ~heatherp     ~mbwhite    ~sstone1  to confirm.   The windows extras applies to regular Fabric 'users' that use curl to download and run docker images, so I think that section can remain in the prereqs doc, although we can remove the language around developing Fabric and 'make', and instead in the developer contribution guide mention that the same Windows guidance would apply.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart   ~pandrejko   Yes there is some guidance in the API docs and git repos for the chaincode and client SDKs.  Though improvement can be made there.   There are sections for both Chaincode and Client SDKs in the Getting Started- these could be good places to add pre-reqs for the development.   ></body> </Action>

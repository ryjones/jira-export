CDATA The prereq doc https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html is all over the map and needs to be cleaned up. In some cases it's talking about using fabric, in some cases its talking about developing Fabric, and in some cases its talking about building applications for Fabric. Often times the context for a given prereq is not mentioned.  For more details see comments in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/940  ></description> </Issue>

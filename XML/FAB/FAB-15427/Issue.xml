CDATA It really does not make sense that the functionality for retrieving chain information is implemented as system chaincode (qscc). It would be cleaner to expose a set of nice APIs for retrieving this information. We can still require the requests to be signed and can enforce ACLs.  In addition to switching the current qscc queries, we should switch GetHistoryForKey() from a chaincode api to a gRPC api, since it doesn't deal with current state like all the other chaincode apis. We can revisist the full set of historical queries at the same time (historical blocks, historical transactions, historical state).  ></description> </Issue>

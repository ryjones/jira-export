CDATA Multiple times, proto definitions which do not adhere to the proto style have been merged.  Not following proto style makes our protos inconsistent, and is something we agreed we would follow long ago.  Since reviewers don't seem to notice when the proto style is skipped, we should really have a CI task which enforces and -1s these violations.  The particular conventions which concern me are that: # Field names are lower_snake_case # Messages are UpperCamelCase # EnumsÂ are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE  ></description> </Issue>

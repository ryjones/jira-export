CDATA gRPC allows a server enforcement policy to be configured which sets a threshold for how often a client can send keepalive pings as well as whether or not to allow keepalives without an active streaming RPCs.  Currently, the default policy is being used and this only allows clients to send keepalive pings every 5 min. Â Based on feedback of people running peers in various cloud environments behind load balancers, firewalls, etc, it seems that 1 min would be a better setting.  Finally, given that the policy will be less restrictive, the keepalive interval used for client connections (e.g. peer to orderer) will be lowered to 1 min as well.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Whereas fab11898 aligned the PTE/OTE/LTE output filenames in the Nexus archived directories with the input files read by TestViewer, it did not modify the logic in Testviewer. Since the output format of the contents (i.e. the printed text lines) in the tests summary reports files has also changed (at least for PTE), we create this task for modifying Testviewer logic to read the data correctly from the new format in pteReport.log files.  Attachments: the pte test output summary files: old (result_FAB-3833-2i.log), and new (FAB-3833-2i-pteReport.log)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~nnao  Each CR's tests were successful on top of the then current master stack.  Then CR 21175 got merged, and shortly after CR 14511 got merged.  CR 14511 could not compile on top of CR 21175.  However prior to merge it never got rebased and therefore never got re-compiled and re-tested on top of CR 21175. If we were to re-test every CR on top of every latest merge, it would utilize an unreasonable amount of resources. Therefore we accept the small amount of risk that there may be race conditions like this occasionally.  ></body> </Action>

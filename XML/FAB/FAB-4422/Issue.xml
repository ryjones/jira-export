CDATA The orderer has a 'JSON' ledger as an option for block storage.  This ledger is meant to be a debugging tool, so it prints the block contents as JSON so that the user may inspect the ledger easily with cat, etc.  However, the JSON marshaling is done via the simple jsonpb marshaler, which simply converts the byte fields to base64, rather than displaying the marshaled message in a readable form.  The protolator framework was created to solve just this problem, and could be utilized by the JSON ledger to make the debugging output much more useful.  ></description> </Issue>

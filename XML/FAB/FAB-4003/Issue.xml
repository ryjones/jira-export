CDATA When checking the OU certificate against the intermediates and roots, the OU certificate is extracted using {{x509.ParseCertificate}}Â whereas the intermediates and roots are sanitised then reimported through {{msp.bccsp.KeyImport}}. The reimporting has the potential to change the signature algorithm which in turn results in certificates not matching, even though they are the same.  Attached is a certificate chain (intermediate and root) that demonstrates the problem  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I'm trying to run the balance-transfer example on multiple hosts. each organization's peers are run on a host and orderer is on a different host. So I've brought up four different VMs . The fourth VM is a DNS server and also has fabric node sdk. I changed the docker-compose files and run it on each VM but I encountered an issue. Org1's peers has no problem but org2's peers seem to have gossip discovery problem or cert problem, IDK. this is the warning I got on peer1.org2.example.com: It seems that peer1.org2.example.com  which is listening on port 7056 and 7058  cannot connect to peer0.org2.example.com  which is listening on ports 7051 and 7053    peer1.org2.example.com | 2018-04-25 07:22:21.107 UTC  gossip/discovery  func1 -> WARN 1df Could not connect to \{127.0.0.1:7051       127.0.0.1:7051 <nil>} : x509: cannot validate certificate for 127.0.0.1 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs     The strange thing is before installing and instantiating a chaincode on channel this warning keeps going but after chaincode instantiation, it stops!  Is there anything wrong with the default certs on crypto-config folder? I realized that in cryptogen.yaml file under the Template section for both orgs there is a variable called SANS which is given the value 'localhost' ? Does this relate to the problem I've encountered?  What should I do to solve this problem?  ></description> </Issue>

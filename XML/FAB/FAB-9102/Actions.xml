CDATA Created a basic runner that used the docker cli to start couch in the background mapping the exposed port to an ephemeral port on the loopback adapter. The container ID was then used to get the port mapping and, later, to stop the container. This worked pretty well locally but doesn't work in our dev container since we don't package the docker cli in it.  At this point I need to discuss how far we want to go and down which path. If we stick with the cli, we'll need to make sure it's available in the environments we run. If we go with the docker client, we should already be setup to use it.  The ultimate goal would be to get enough pieces of infrastructure exposed via runners to be able to run the e2e scenarios in ginkgo. This is just a small scale instance of that.  ></body> </Action>

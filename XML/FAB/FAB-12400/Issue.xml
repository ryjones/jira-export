CDATA Hyperledger Fabric v1.2  Currently, developers can fire off one and only one chaincode event within the context of a single transaction. This is very limiting; instead, developers run into use cases where firing off multiple chaincode events is needed.  The current API for firing off chaincode events looks like this: ChaincodeStub.SetEvent()  Instead, it would be great if the API was improved to something along the following lines:  ChaincodeStub.AddEvent() ChaincodeStub.GetEvents()  ></description> </Issue>

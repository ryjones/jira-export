CDATA How are you running the peer, in Docker, in Kube. Either way, did you mount persistent storage to these locations. It looks like the peer restarted and there was no persistent storage (thus data loss) and the file is missing.  That being said, you will get much more support using either RocketChat (chat.hyperledger.org) or the mailing list as Jira is for bug tracking, not support requests. You will get thousands of users to help you rather than the very small subset of us who monitor Jira.  ></body> </Action>

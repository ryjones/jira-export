CDATA If org1 has multiple peers, and every peer has an individual external chaincode builder service, for example, chaincode-as-external-service-peer2-org1 is responsible for peer2-org1.  Because connection.json is different, the chaincode id is different. All the chaincode lifecylce, i.e install, approveformyorg, commit, do work OK. But invoke chaincode init fails.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA CI process checks existence of trailing space(s). If trailing space(s) exist in modified ASCII-text file, VerifyBuild fails. On the other hand, local build does not check it. This patch adds checking for trailing space(s) existence in local build time.  This bug may occur on any previous version of fabric that use ci-management code after Apr 12 2017 (added trailing space checking). I don't know what ci-maangement version is used on each fabric version has pushed to gerrit, so I keep JIRA's Affect Version/s empty.  ></description> </Issue>

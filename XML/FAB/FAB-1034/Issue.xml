CDATA The gossip uses PKI-ID to authenticate between peers. In 0.5 it was simply the hash of the cert given by the membership service. Now it is no more, but the gossip layer still needs a PKI-ID, so I'd like a method that deterministically and w.h.p without collisions maps a certificate to a PKI-ID.  Many thanks in advance.   I created the following JIRA item on our side: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1047  ></description> </Issue>

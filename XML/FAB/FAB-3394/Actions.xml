CDATA There are two issues, one of which we can address, one of which we cannot. The  gerrit download plugin|https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/download-commands/  does not allow us to default to ssh - this is a weakness in the plugin itself.  The second issue is that http: instead of https: is offered. This is a config error on gerrit - we will need to take a fifteen minute downtime in order to fix it. I will send mail to the TSC to schedule this downtime in the next few weeks.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="57327" issue="37321" author="denyeart" type="comment" body=" ~angelo.decaro  I removed the FixVersion so that this Jira item does not show up in v2.0 release dashboards.  Typically we add the test plan to the dev epic Test Plan field (if you click edit on an epic you&apos;ll see it), and add &apos;Test Tasks&apos; to the dev epic.  That being said, I realize its sometimes easier to have a Jira umbrella item for all the Test Tasks." created="2019-02-19 23:04:29.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2019-02-19 23:04:29.0"/>

CDATA Before closing this testplan task, coverage must be reviewed and approved (via upvote or comment) by the epic feature owner and the test leads identified below.  *Unit Test (UT):*  Automated unit tests are merged in repo, as go tests or otherwise part of build/verify jenkins jobs. Code coverage tracked in Jenkins:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Daily/job/fabric-unit-test-coverage-daily-master-x86_64/   *Function Test (FVT)*:  Expand unit testcases beyond traditional UT coverage, for the following integration scenarios that otherwise might be done using the ginko framework) - we consider the following extended unit tests: * Double spending resistance * Only the rightful owner can spend a token * Tokens cannot be transferred to invalid recipients or for a zero amount  E2E testcases scenario consists of a setup with two orgs A and B for token transactions  Other functional testing required: N/A   *System Verification Test (SVT):* FabToken is a change to fabric that affects validation. We suggest to perform SVT tests that involve these components with a CLI or Client-SDK that issues, transfers and redeem tokens in a network setup with at least two orgs, preferably more.  ></description> </Issue>

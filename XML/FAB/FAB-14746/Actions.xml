CDATA I believe this needs to be bumped to high priority. I'm seeing it affect 1.3 as well. 7 days ago, *counterfeiter* version bumped from *6.0.1* to *6.0.2*.

CDATA This was resolved in release-1.2 with FAB-14783.   ~mastersingh24  From your statements in FAB-14783 you thought counterfeiter required Go 1.10.3, but release-1.3 is already at 1.10.4. Do we need a change in release-1.3?  ></body> </Action>

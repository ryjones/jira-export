CDATA  ~baohua  ~mastersingh24 , Isn't is too late now to change the API? Anyway, following golang standard naming we should call it just *Public*, no?   ~binhn  ~ChristopherFerris , Which are the rules for changing the API? How do we deprecate methods?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~angelo.decaro  i guess the API freezing is due to the 1.0 release.  now the 1.0 version is out, we can continue on the improvement?  And about the name, as it's only return part of the content, would suggest include the PublicPart in the name. How do u think?  Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~angelo.decaro  you deprecate a method by having its comment begin with "Deprecated" e.g.  https://golang.org/src/syscall/bpf_bsd.go?h=Deprecated#L20   As for what are the rules... it isn't clear that we have a deprecation case here as much as a mis-named method. Why not just fix the name?Â   ></body> </Action>

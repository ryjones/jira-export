CDATA If multiple smart contracts are defined in the same chaincode, how can I use the `{{peer chaincode invoke}}` command to specify which contract we want to invoke from the chaincode?  This is a pretty confusing thing for many. This might be easy while using the Node SDK for the client applications to select a specific contract inside a chaincode while using the getContract() API.   But the docs don't specify much about how to do the same with the `{{peer chaincode invoke}}` command   Some googling does bring up something about using namespaces like {{AssetContract:MyTransaction}}, but isn't clear.   Clarifying this would be really helpful for many and it needs to be added in to the docs.  ></description> </Issue>

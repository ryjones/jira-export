CDATA Test name: Performance test: 1M  richqueries, 2 channels Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with couchDB with 2-field indexing     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, marbles02 go chaincode, instantiated     transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 250000 queries concurrently with tx id from 1 to 250000           thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2  Network Topology: docker containers; 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels  Client Driver: PTE  Pre-requisite: in order to query the transactions exist in the DB, --FAB-8694-- needs to be executed first. Without execution of --FAB-8694--, the queries will return invalid since the transactions do not exist in the DB.  Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error  ></description> </Issue>

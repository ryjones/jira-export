<Action id="46618" issue="31332" author="wlahti" type="comment" body="Perhaps you ran into the same issue reported by FAB-10771. That user was performing commands in the latest documentation, which uses the --peerAddresses and --tlsRootCertFiles flags introduced in v1.2,  but running them against Fabric v1.1 peers. When using v1.1 images, be sure to follow:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/ , which is the documentation that loads by default when you go to https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/." created="2018-06-27 16:37:11.0" updateauthor="wlahti" updated="2018-06-27 16:37:11.0"/>

CDATA Thank you Will,  Indeed it was about the version I was using v1.1 as well as some minor differences I found.   I solved this issue by repeating the terminal commands that run automatically in the simplified tutorial ( running command:  ./byfn.sh up). The main difference are: # in the Policy, use OR to make it work. # Install chiancode to all peers and join them all to the channel. # run: peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n mycc -c '\{"Args": "invoke","a","b","10" }'  # run:  peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '\{"Args": "query","a" }’  This will get the right value of 90 for A  ></body> </Action>

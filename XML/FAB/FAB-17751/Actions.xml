CDATA  ~baohua   The line causing the nil pointer is:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/orderer/consensus/etcdraft/chain.go#L1109   Could you maybe put each of those variables on their own line, and then run again to see which is the variable that causes the nil pointer?  It should then be easier to track down the problem.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The 2PRs only address nil pointer exception error, but did not solve the actual cause for the problem, therefore they got closed, and future investigation is required.  For my findings, currently this bug occurs inconsistently (flaky) when orderers are being repeatedly added and removed from channel. In addition, the test will pretty much pass every time for only a single action on add and remove. It is when multiple add/remove actions being called in a roll, and it will fail.   ></body> </Action>

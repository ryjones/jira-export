CDATA The existing validation for packaged couchdb indexes in chaincode was only getting called if peer CLI packaged the index.  Need the same validation logic called if an SDK client attempts to package and install the chaincode.  This change ensures that the same validation is called during peer CLI packaging and during LSCC install chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Questions: * Do we have any docs for APIs? * How should one update the network when turning mutual TLS on (when it was initially off)? (Perform channel update first, then peers, I'm assuming.) * Not clear what the orderer config setup should look like when mutual TLS is on. The JIRA issues refer to peer and orderer connections. (I see peer clientAuthRequired and clientRootCAs, but nothing for orderer. I want to make sure that nothing additional needs to be done with the orderer other than channel update to use mutual TLS.)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~mastersingh24   Would like to know if it would be possible to add the ability to use a different client cert/key rather than having to use the same pair for both server and client.  Consider that one uses a globally trusted CA to sign the peer's server cert, we then have to add this globally trusted CA cert to other peers that this peer would gossip with, which makes it relatively simple for _anyone_ to acquire a certificate that the peer would trust which would limit the effectiveness of mutual TLS.  Does this sound reasonable, or is there some technical reason that I am not aware of which makes this request non-trivial?  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="35869" issue="22733" author="latitiah" type="comment" body=" ~mastersingh24  Another point of clarification: I noticed that the file name changed for the user cert in the orderer from server.crt to client.crt when using cryptogen, but the contents look pretty much the same. It&apos;s not clear to me what should be different about these certificates, if anything, when using mutual TLS. Or is it a misunderstanding that the certificates will need to change at all? Any particular flags that need to be set?" created="2017-12-05 17:17:02.0" updateauthor="latitiah" updated="2017-12-05 17:17:02.0"/>

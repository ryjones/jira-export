CDATA Apparently a community decision was made to settle on the word 'channel' to describe the set of resources (including backing hash chain structure) as opposed to the word 'chain' which is used throughout the code.  It is not reasonable to attempt to transition the nomenclature inside the code away from the word chain to the word channel in the near term, as this would require too much work.  However, the proto messages should stick with us for a very long time, so it makes sense to make the modification there before we cut the v1 release.  ></description> </Issue>

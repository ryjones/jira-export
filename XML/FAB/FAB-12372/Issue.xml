CDATA When the {{pprof}} network endpoint is exposed, a {{GET}} request to {{/pprof/goroutine?debug=2}} will capture all of the currently running go routines. When {{pprof}} is not enabled, this information is harder to come by.  In an effort to improve the situation, a signal handler should be implemented in each of the fabric servers that will use {{runtime/pprof/#Lookup}} to get the {{goroutines}} profile and log it with {{runtime/pprof/#Profile.WriteTo}} to a properly configured logging with debug level 2. This will capture the go routines into the logs without terminating the process.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~sykesm  Is there anyone on the Hyperledger dev team that might be able to work on this task? I still feel that it will be incredibly useful.

CDATA > Is there anyone on the Hyperledger dev team that might be able to work on this task?  I have no idea.  ~ales  is probably best positioned to answer that.  What I can say is that we're trying to clean out some very old items from JIRA so we're tagging any item that has not had meaningful updates or engagement in the last 9 months. As announced on the mailing list, these items are likely going to get closed next week. If you and Ale can have discussion about the future of this item, that would be helpful.  In general, for features, we're moving to a process where RFCs are opened in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/ for discussion. If this item were to be implemented, I'd expect it to be reviewed through the process documented there.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

The use case as described (sharing a symmetric key among multiple recipients) is a good fit for proxy re-encryption (PRE) as Alice, the data owner, can encrypt it once and then grant (and revoke) access to arbitrarily many recipients." created="2020-01-17 22:33:49.0" updateauthor="maclane" updated="2020-01-17 22:33:49.0"/>
<Action id="66836" issue="37202" author="ales" type="comment" body="The use-case is definitely interesting, but a fair question would be whether the implementation would belong to fabric proper or to an application-level helper library that lets client and chaincode handle the crypto operations.

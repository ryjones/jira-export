CDATA Some suggested hints to help with this process: # Use a VM without python2 installed, but with python3 installed instead. This allows you to isolate and rerun as needed. If your environment gets messed up, just throw it away and get a new one. # Install the different fabric repositories # Build the images and binaries from the repositories # From fabric-test repo, execute the install_behave.sh (this uses pip, so I'm pretty sure this will need to change) # Run the regression scripts. # What breaks? Do you see what needs to be fixed from the errors? # There is a python converter script that can help migrate python files to python3  https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html Â if needed. Feel free to run this on any python files to see if anything comes up as needing to be converted. (Sometimes if I'm not paying attention, I can see myself resorting back to python2 habits.) # Run the tests individually if needed, if the error messages are too great. # Most of the changes will probably be in the feature and feature-upgrade directories.  ></body> </Action>

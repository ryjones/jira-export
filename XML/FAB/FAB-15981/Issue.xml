CDATA Refer to Item 35 of tab "Behave Testcases" in shared google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741  Existing test 'integration/gossip/gossip_test.go It("solo network with 2 orgs, 2 peers each, should sync from the peer if no orderer available")' stops the 2nd peer of first org and both peers of 2nd org, sends TXs, and starts all again. Call this existing code = PartA.  PartB is being added with FAB-15980.  This task is to repeat the steps in PartA and PartB. This time we will call them PartC and PartD, but they differ by using disconnect instead of stop - so the affected peers still function and send messages but cannot receive msgs from each other, and then resume after reconnecting 15 secs later. (Imagine it is like they all communicate through a switch which goes down and halts traffic for that time period.)  One way is to rerun the same test steps (although if continuing with same network, note that peer0 would be the nonleader, assuming PartB is done). Another way would be to do this with a 3rd peer in Org1 and two peers in a new Org3, so as to avoid any direct dependency on the PartA and PartB.   ></description> </Issue>

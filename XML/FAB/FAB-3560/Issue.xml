CDATA Running via Peer CLI and for any Endorsement failure response set by the user-chaincode is not printed to the console.   This should include a similar output alike when Endorsement Proposal is successful. This should at least list out the fields set by the user-chaincode (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/proposal_response.proto#L58)  {quote} Error: Error endorsing invoke: rpc error: code = 2 desc = <pb.response.message> {quote}  This is run on 19th April published Fabric Images on CI Channel (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-ci?msg=7jxNech7WzkP9ngi3)  *Impact*: Our chaincode E2E testing is performed using Peer CLI and this information is helpful to confirm whether this is really part of the response before we start integrating with the HFC using SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In fabric, the logging is based on go-logging and logs indefinitely to the same file (to stdout, but I'm sure it can be configured to log to a file too somehow).   If the logging is set to DEBUG, the log file size may grow in a fast rate, eventually filling the partition the log resides in. It would be good to have the logging framework be able to "switch" to a new file, and archive (gzip or something similar) the old log files after switching to the new file.    ~binhn   ~wlahti   ~mastersingh24    ></description> </Issue>

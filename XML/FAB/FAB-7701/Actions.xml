CDATA Bulk Jira update: For remaining tasks with FixVersion v1.3.0, the Reporter should update to v1.4.0 or Future, or Close. Add a comment with any clarification needed, so that release managers can close out v1.3.0 release cleanly.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A couple of observations on this: # some of these examples are extensively used for testing, chaincode/go/example02 in particular # at least one of them is merely used for testing: chaincode/go/example03 actually reads: // This program is an erroneous chaincode program that attempts to put state in query context - query should return error  So, I'm not sure we really want to move all of what's under fabric/examples to fabric-samples. Instead, I think we should only move the actual examples (this is still the majority), and keep what's used for testing within fabric under a different directory name like "test" or maybe the existing unit-test directory?  Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA   ~lehors  Make sense not moving all examples to fabric-samples and renaming "examples" to "test-artifacts" or something.  This will also give us time to move true examples into samples (they'd need to be vetted and made complete with docs etc to be fit for fabric-samples).  ></body> </Action>

I wouldn't be quite that shy about it though. I think we should move every example that is not used for testing purposes within the fabric repo. I agree some examples would benefit from additional documentation but I don't see why that would be a prerequisite to the move. This can be done after the move just as well.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Deploy a network using a pipeline with the following topology on the network, we will reset this network weekly: * 2 orgs ** 2 Peer's per org *** 1 CA per org *** Use CouchDB ** 5 Raft Orderers  We should install and instantiate a simple Go chaincode on the Chaos network such as samplecc. This chaincode will serve no purpose other than to drive traffic, so it need not be anything fancy.  This network will be redeployed weekly so it needs to be a pipeline and the artifacts need to be saved as a common name in Artifactory we can reference in the pipeline that will drive traffic.  ></description> </Issue>

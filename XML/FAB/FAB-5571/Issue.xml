CDATA  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12945/   There may end up being some assumptions for using this repo. For example, hyperledger fabric images and binaries may need to already be built for use with the tests in the fabric-test repo. These prerequisites need to be outlined.  We could borrow some info from: ../fabric-test/regression/daily/README.md  Also, have pointers to the corresponding readmes for each of the test frameworks and tools used.  Add notes for items like this reminder: When pulling from the fabric-test repo, remember to perform: `git submodule update --init --recursive` in order to pull the code located in the submodules.  ></description> </Issue>

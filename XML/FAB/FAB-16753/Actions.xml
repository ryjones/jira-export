CDATA At a high level, this will be done in a few phases:  1. Create structures that hold the configuration data that are tagged with default values and yaml names. 2. Create a package that populates the configuration data using default values tagged on the structure. 3. Transition the source of truth from viper to the new configuration package. 4. Create tool that generates example yaml documents and reference documentation from a top level structure. 5. Incrementally normalize the configuration structure to use consistent keys and stanzas. 6. Remove legacy references to viper.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Good suggestions, and besides the yaml config file, we still need the environment variable way, which is nice to support cloud-native deployment.  In terms of the configurations inside the code, I think we should expose all of them with the default value to the users, instead of hiding some by design.  ></body> </Action>

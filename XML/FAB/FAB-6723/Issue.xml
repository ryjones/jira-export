CDATA The gossip layer needs to be updated about chaincodes that are installed in the peer and also instantiated on a specific channel.  This is to be able to disseminate information about installed and instantiated chaincodes (each peer would disseminate to other peers in the channel the installed chaincodes it has that have been instantiated too).  What I think we need to do, is to first to enumerate the installed CCs on the peer and then for each such CC, check LSCC. * Installed chaincodes:  ** At startup, scan the file system to see what chaincodes have been instantiated ** After a successful chaincode install also add the installed chaincode to the set * Instantiated chaincodes: ** At startup, do a LSCC query to the scan the chaincodes in the channel ** Post validation, if a transaction with a target chaincode of LSCC exists in the block, rescan the LSCC namespace for installed CCs   ~C0rWin  ,  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~ales   ~jyellick  thoughts?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA ah, so - at some point we wanted to implement leave channel, but - eventually we didn't do that. However - Since peers run a metadata dissemination protocol among themselves, preparations to support leave channel were needed in order to support leave channel at a later version.  So I implemented the needed support for gossip, and it knows to understand that peers left a channel starting from v1.1, however - we're currently at v1.3 and still we didn't implement it in the peer...   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Workarounds - that depends... can you explain your use case? A workaround depends on what you need.  I think the tricky part in a "workaround" is that the index of the ledger is shared among all chains ( ~manish-sethi  please correct me if I'm wrong?) If we could somehow remove a chain from the index then we could just wipe the block files of the chain and restart the peer...   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, the index is shared among all chains and also state would be there for the chain. That should not be a problem. If you delete the index and statedb, upon restart (assuming after deleting the block files), the index and statedb are rebuilt.  However, having said this, there is another place where one may get stuck - which is ledgermgmt. This keeps track of all the chains that the peer is part of. So, best would be to avoid any manual operation of this sort.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA +1 to this, as the peer's lifecycle is still not a close-loop with both channel and chaincode resources.  This is a basic requirement somehow.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Fabric CLI provides methods to query the state of the peer and channel, however these methods are not scripting friendly. i.e. it's not easy to process the result without additional fragile tools, like grep, awk, etc.  In particular, implementing following methods will be very useful for automation scripts.  Please see _"Future (Dream) Work"_ section in this  post|https://accenture.github.io/blog/2019/06/25/hl-fabric-meets-kubernetes.html#future-dream-work . One major step toward that goal will be making channel and chaincode flows declarative, i.e. given the desired state of network, flows will try to reach that state, and following methods will greatly simplify this task.    ||Command||Function|| |peer channel checkexists <channelID>|Check if channel exists, return 0 if exists, 99 o/w| |peer channel checkjoined <channelID>|Check if peer joined to channel, return 0 if joined, 99 o/w| |peer channel checkanchors <channelID> <organization>|Check if there is a configtx exists in channel for anchor peers of organization, return 0 if exists, 99 o/w| |peer chaincode checkinstalled <chaincode name> <version>|Check if certain version of chaincode is installed to peer, return 0 if installed, 99 o/w| |peer chaincode checkinstantiated <chaincode name>  version  <channelID>|Check if  certain version of  chaincode is instantiated at channel, return 0 if instantiated, 99 o/w|        ></description> </Issue>

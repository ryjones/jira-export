CDATA This builds on top of FAB-5951, to allow for encshim to leverage a PRNG/IV passed to it using proposal's transient data to determine the randomness used in encryption process, and therefore allow for deterministically generated ciphertexts.  This is needed in the case of chaincodes that leverage encshim and require more than one endorsements for their endorsement policy to be satisfied.  If such an enhancement is not used,  endorsers would use their local source of randomness and would likely result into different ciphertexts for the same value.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA From the code sample in  hyperledger/education|https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/fabric-material  fabric-material, the _tuna-app_ uses _basic-network_. The basic-network has a file `generate.sh` which uses the `.yaml` files to generate the content inside `_config/*_` and `_crypto-config/*_`. The git repository for education as well as  fabric-samples|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release/basic-network/crypto-config  contains the certificates already.  Ideally these should be generated via the generate.sh process using the cryptogen, configtxgen and other tools. Clearing out the content from the two directories and recreating the certificates works perfectly.  After creating the network and registering the Admin user and a demo user, a query to the chaincode results in an error unable to verify as the certificate was signed by an unknown authority. {code:java} sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: Failed to deserialize creator identity, err the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "ca.org1.example.com"{code}    In general these certs and data shouldn't be committed, Is there a reason why this is being done? Am I doing something wrong here?  With the default certificates in the commit, the application works just fine.     ></description> </Issue>

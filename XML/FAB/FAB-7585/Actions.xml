I think the goal of basic network was to simply get an "instant" environment to show people how things worked and then they should move on to BYFN.  But no real reason we can't modify this to generate certs  ></body> </Action>

CDATA For the .tx binary corrupted, I have to start a new yaml from scratch, no idea why it was buggy     For the error message, I could resolve the error using the 4th bullet of troubleshooting here :  https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#troubleshooting   The CA was no taking my cert files, so it was generating new ones at startup without I knew it  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I mean, I don't think there is a bug there. My educated guess is that Fabric is reacting in the proper way.  The issue here, as it has been said in the description, is more about configuration.  ></body> </Action>

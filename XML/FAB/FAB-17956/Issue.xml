This was masked by the fact that the peer CLI automatically signed all transactions before submitting them. There is also some sort of issue with updating anchor peers (may just be user error but I need to investigate further). For now, this task will be used to ensure we have a working integration test that truly verifies the configtx library can successfully update the config in a running fabric network." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-06-03 21:15:57.0" updated="2020-06-08 20:17:39.0" resolutiondate="2020-06-08 20:17:39.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="59112" archived="N"/>

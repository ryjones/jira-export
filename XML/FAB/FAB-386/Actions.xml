CDATA As you point, not all configuration data needs to be consistent across all nodes, and might not be appropriate to store in the replica log.  Particularly I'm thinking things like logging levels and non-protocol level tune-ables (things like buffer or cache sizes), as well as storage locations, or anything else which might vary by system.  I also think there's something to be said for consistency with the other components in the fabric, especially as we will likely want to plug in some fabric components (like the high performance raw ledger) into the orderer.   ></body> </Action>

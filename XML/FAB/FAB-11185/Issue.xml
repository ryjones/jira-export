CDATA The existing SVT job executes LTE, OTE and Behave tests and this job run for 8-9 hrs. We have discussed to split this job to run less number of hours and give flexibility to run these tests individually. Split the SVT job into three individual jobs and run them daily.  This one is for fabric-lte # fabric-lte job runs only the tests from  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/regression/daily/ledger_lte.py  , ** https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/regression/daily/runDailyTestSuite.sh   ></description> </Issue>

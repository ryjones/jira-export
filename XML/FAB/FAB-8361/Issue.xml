CDATA Currently committer UT using ledger, to actually check functionality, however this introduces complexity and couples test to be dependent on the ledger package. This dependency could be removed by leveraging: {code} "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock" {code}  which will allow to speed up the test, to make it parallel and voids the need to create physical ledger during UT.  ></description> </Issue>

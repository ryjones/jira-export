CDATA There's a couple of issues with the existing Kafka documentation. # Every mention of Fabric is actually a mention of Hyperledger Fabric. This always felt wrong, and I'm glad to find out that it is actually redundant. See the first paragraph here:  https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2017-September/001086.html  # Most importantly, the formatting is way off, and for the life of me I cannot figure out the right way to get indentations and proper list numbering.

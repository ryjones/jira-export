<Action id="28194" issue="17757" author="dhuseby" type="comment" body="The best way to do this for now will be to use GPG to sign tags/commits in git.  Then use the same GPG key to sign the resulting binaries.  Managing the opsec around those keys will be tricky as well as distributing them public keys for people to use to independently verify the signatures.  The Tails OS we page has a pretty good walk through on verifying the binary .iso file they distribute.  I think we should emulate that for now, with an eye towards moving to reproducible builds in the future." created="2017-07-11 22:56:48.0" updateauthor="dhuseby" updated="2017-07-11 22:56:48.0"/>

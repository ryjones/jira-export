CDATA Today the fabric tools Dockerfile calls `RUN make configtxgen configtxlator cryptogen peer discover idemixgen`. This should be changed to point to a make target that encapsulates all of these items so we don't have to make changes in multiple places in the future.  We need to look at the available release targets and choose the appropriate target accordingly.  ></description> </Issue>

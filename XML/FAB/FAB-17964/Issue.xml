CDATA Stop the chain, then remove file ledger resources.  The removal of file ledger resources is when we persist the channel.remove marker file in the file repo.  If the orderer crashes before removal is finished, then either the marker was written, so we'll recover and complete the removal, or the chain will resume normal operation after restart.  Note: the etcdraft.Chain triggers the creation of a follower.Chain when Halt() is called. In order to stop the chain before removal this must be changed.  ></description> </Issue>

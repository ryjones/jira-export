CDATA This API should have been a replacement for the event hub service. It's lacking in at least two ways over this previous API. There is no means to know the services is ready and connected until it receives the first block. Current EH API first delivered as Status block with a success to make sure the connection is fully established and from the then on would start receiving blocks. This allowed SDK to easily make this synchronous.  Second this API does not offer an option to return the next block is sees added, but always returns the last block on the ledger regardless if that block may be a year old. This also has the consequences that if for example bad network connections result in reestablishment of the connection it will see that same block repeatedly if there were no new blocks added.  It was first suggested that to me that the SDKs should address these short comings. I don't think each SDKs should have to do this. I plan for the JSDK to expose it for what it is. Let applications deal with this behavior.  Given a chance to vote I'd go back to the old API as I think it was better suited for an eventing service. It only lacked one needed feature that would allow it to start receiving blocks from a specific block number.  ></description> </Issue>

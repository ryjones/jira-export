CDATA Hi, Please give your opinion about the following, thank you Suppose our smart contract deducts $ 100 for each call from someone's account and returns true to who calls it. Now, if the three endorsers have to execute the smart contract, they deduct three-time, and they have all see the same result that is true, but we deduct three-time from that account, and it is not what we want. What will be the transaction life cycle? Is it deducted from the account all three times? I know that the endorsement phase is a simulation, meaning that no world state changes, but how does this happen because we are deducted from the account to execute each request? I want to know how the endorsement phase behaves with this contract scenario exactly.  ></description> </Issue>

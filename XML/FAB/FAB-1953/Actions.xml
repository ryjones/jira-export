CDATA  ~Ratnakar  ~movee2005  Hi, looks like you don't have couchdb started or configured.  Your peer simply can't connect to it.  If you are in vagrant environment you can run 'couchdb start' to start it.  If you are in docker environment then  ~AdnanChoudhury  can help you configure it.  I think we can cancel this Bug.   Note that there is a work item already to provide a more clear error message if peer can't find/connect to couchdb: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1925.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  You are right, CouchDB is not started hence the above issue.  I was using docker based approach and didn't realized that I need to run couchdb manually when native binaries are used for starting peer and orderer  We see some issue with docker-compose (channel creation fails) , either I shall raise a new issue or will discuss with you to sort it out.   {noformat} Error: proposal failed (err: rpc error: code = 2 desc = Get http://couchdb0:5984/myc1: dial tcp 172.18.0.3:5984: getsockopt: connection refused) Usage: peer channel join  flags  {noformat}    Thank you.  ></body> </Action>

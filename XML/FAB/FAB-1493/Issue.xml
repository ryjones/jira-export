CDATA https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2365 adds protobuf support for Policies. We can now serialize those policies and store them with the LCCC at the time of with the deploy/upgrade of chaincode and use them at VSCC validation in the committer.  This will be done over several tasks * accept a serialized policy and have the CLI send an at-least-1-signature * have VSCC validate a tx using that policy * have the CLI accept a "policy" to accept a complex policy   ></description> </Issue>

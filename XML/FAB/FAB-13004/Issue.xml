CDATA Preface: If any of the following test scenarios itemized below are covered in the fabric-sdk-node integration tests, then we could skip those scenarios and just add the missing tests (either here in Behave or in the node sdk integration test suite).  Test the functionality of chaincode-to-chaincode using node-sdk. Refer to FAB-5384, a story describing some chaincode testing done with Behave. Several subtasks are chaincode-to-chaincode testcases (using CLI). We should be able to add test scenarios for the use of the node-sdk to all of those testcases fairly easily, including the following. We should link this to the testcases which we ultimately choose to implement, from this subset of the tests in the chaincodes.feature file:  * FAB-4704 * FAB-4717 * FAB-4718 * FAB-4720 * FAB-4721 * FAB-4722 * FAB-5384  We can change them to Scenario Outlines, and run them twice, once with CLI and once with Node SDK. However, I don't think our behave framework supports service discovery, so this would only involve functional cc2cc tests with node sdk (without using service discovery). To include service discovery too, we would need additional enhancements to behave, which may not be warranted especially if other tests elsewhere cover the interactions with service discovery.   ></description> </Issue>

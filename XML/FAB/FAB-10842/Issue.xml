CDATA Managing docker containers with Rancher I have on my Hyperledger infra one Peer, one orderer, one cli et one ca. Those 4 containers can communicate with each other because they are on network mode Managed. I can create a channel successfully.  Composer network install works fine.  Everything is ok until composer start network command. When start command is launched, a new docker container is created on the host under the name dev-nameofthepeer In the log of this new container I get th following error: ERROR  lib/handler.js - Chat stream with peer - on error: "Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: Name resolution failure\n  I think the issue is on the network side because, on the rancher console the new container is created with the network type host .... all previously created containers received an ip address form the rancher infra.  I already tryed to insert an npmrcfile in my composer start network command including : registry= http://registry.npmjs.org|http://registry.npmjs.org/   but still same error  Host to deploy is running on ubuntu 16.04 server. Composer v0.19.6 running on ubuntu 16.04 client.  I tried with all containers on network mode "host" but that way, impossible to create the channel, containers cannot communicate with each other ...  What I need to know is how to have the container created by composer created with the network node managed ... how to pass this parameter ?

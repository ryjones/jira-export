CDATA Steps to reproduce: 1. Following the guideline in the "getting started" document (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/) setting up a 3 peer network. The only exception is peer2 has "PEER_GOSSIP_ORGLEADER=false". Docker-compose is attached.  ^docker-compose-goosip-error.yaml   2. From the same doc ( (http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/), channel is created, all 3 peers join it, deploy and invoke the chaincode. 3. Querying the chaincode from peer0, peer1 works, but querying from peer2 gives error:  {code:java} Error: Error endorsing query: rpc error: code = 2 desc = failed to obtain cds for mycc - transaction not found mycc/myc2 {code}  Expected:  Query passes with query result "90" for the given example.

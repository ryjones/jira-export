CDATA *Privacy*  Depending on the needs of a network, participants in a Business-to-Business (B2B) network might be extremely sensitive about how much information they share. For other networks, privacy will not be a top concern.  Hyperledger Fabric supports networks where privacy (using channels) is a key operational requirement as well as networks that are comparatively open.        I have question on this and maybe it's just the wording.  But this implies for me that channels would give you privacy.  In actuality, I think you would need for applications to know when transactions are completed and fully written to the ledger. The only means to to do that is allowing an event thub.  The event hub  is free to see all blocks in the ledger.  How is privacy there?   ></description> </Issue>

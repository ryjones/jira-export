CDATA https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/capabilities.html    h2. Privacy and confidentiality  Hyperledger Fabric enables competing business interests, and any groups that require private, confidential transactions, to coexist on the same permissioned network. Private *channels* are restricted messaging paths that can be used to provide transaction privacy and confidentiality for specific subsets of network members. All data, including transaction, member and channel information, on a channel are invisible and inaccessible to any network members not explicitly granted access to that channel.  ></body> </Action>

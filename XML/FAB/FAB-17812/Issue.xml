CDATA fabric-sdk-node has a copied version of hyperledger/fabric-protos and publishes that at as a module. This means it's liable to not pick up changes made to hyperledger/fabric-protos. fabric-chaincode-node copies fabric-protos and relies on it, so this is liable to the same issue.  Both can be resolved by hyperledger/fabric-protos publishing the npm module and sdk-node/chaincode-node updated to rely on that.  List of stuff would include (perhaps not in this order): * publish fabric-protos from from hyperledger/fabric-protos * update node-sdk and chaincode-node to use new hyperledger/fabric-protos npm module * turn off fabric-protos publishing from node-sdk repository * remove fabric-protos npm module from node-sdk  ></description> </Issue>

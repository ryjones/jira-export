CDATA The lifecycle object that caches the deployed chaincodes of the peer - receives a notification from the ledger before the install of the chaincode actually happens. The install might fail, and then gossip would publish false information.  For this - the ledger listener separated the notification into 2 steps: * notify about the deployment, which happens just before the install * notify whether the deployment was successful or not, which is only relevant for install.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The following sample was created by  ~Yogendrasri  and  ~mgk    https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-deploy-sample-application-ibm-blockchain-platform/index.html    This sample shows how to use the fabcar sample with TLS     We should incorporate the changes in this sample into the fabric project, as they are of general use to users. Specifically, we need # Documentation Updates # New Commands # New "fabcar with TLS" sample, including documentation on how to do this.     Details for these 3 areas.  The Documentation updates are  * Create a new section in the docs for "Writing Applications".  This can use some of the general material in the fabcar sample ( http://fabricstaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html)  * Create a new subsection on "Using TLS with your applications"     The new command should * Enroll a user to a Fabric CA, modelled on the enrollUser.js command in the external sample.     The new sample should * incorporate all the the sample fabcar updates into a new sample called fabcar_tls * The underlying network for this sample should be TLS enabled. * There should be a new section in the Sample Applications section on how to use this new "fabcar_tls" sample.     ></description> </Issue>

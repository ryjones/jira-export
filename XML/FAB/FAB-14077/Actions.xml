A couple of questions:  {quote}except from the number of active TLS connections, which will be labeled with the remote host (it should be 1 or 0, unless we have a server that rotated certificates and forgot to change it in some channels, and that's why I want to do a per host labels- so the admins can easily see that they forgot a channel){quote} I'm not sure I get that. Can you rephrase?  {quote}Number of goroutines for message dispatch{quote} What information does this give you? How would I, as the inspector of this metric, know whether the range that I'm witnessing is normal or not?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA From Gari: As to why it was removed, several reasons: 1) we moved Go chaincode out of the Fabric repo for 2.0 2) We set a requirement on Go chaincode to have no external dependencies other than the Fabric protos 3) We really want to remove all of the shim ext stuff ,,, should not be part of Go chaincode as we do not want to maintain unnecessary code (any of the extension stuff should be samples or perhaps their own versioned packages) 4) That code should not be using the bccsp package 5) No one has really asked about it so we had to reason to provide a different example (edited)   ></body> </Action>

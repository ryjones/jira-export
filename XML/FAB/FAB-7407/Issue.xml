CDATA The system behave framework needs to allow for the testing of config updates to a channel. This includes both system channel and application channel updates. In theory, there are 2 ways that a user would update a channel - using configtxlator and using the SDKs. The SDK implementations are not complete at the time of opening this issue, so the focus will be on using configtxlator.  The following are the possible updates that may occur on a channel: * add an organization * remove an organization * add a policy (Different policies for system and application channels) * modify a policy (Different policies for system and application channels) * change batch size * change channel restriction * change orderer consensus type  Backend process: * channel fetch of the block -> saved to a file (pb format) * start configtxlator * POST to configtxlator to convert to json * Figure out what portion of the config data needs to be updated * A diff between updated config and original config will be needed and sent to configtxlator in order to generate a new config block -> saved to file (pb format) (can we get json output instead so we don't have to convert back to json?) * ??? POST to configtxlator to convert to json * Add envelope headers * POST to configtxlator to generate block file -> saved to a file (pb format) * peers should sign the block * channel should be updated with signed block  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/channel_update.html  ></description> </Issue>

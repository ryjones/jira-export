CDATA Here we need to implement local interfaces representing TMS and defined in FAB-11941 for token transaction processor (TMSTxProcessor).   At its construction time, TMSTxProcessor should receive a policy checker (implemented using the policy framework and with the related channel's MSPs), and a ledger reader/writer (implemented using the TxSimulator that is available at the Token Transaction Processor).  TMSTxProcessor should pass these objects to the TMS function processTx or Commit (older name) that would perform any security checks needed and ledger writes.     ></description> </Issue>

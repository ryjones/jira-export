CDATA  ~jyellick  - This could be caused either of the followings  1) calling multiple times "close()" on a ledger  2) first calling Close() on ledgerMgr and then calling Close on individual ledgers  Both the situation are covered on the ledger side by the fix that  ~wlahti  submitted for FAB-15915 (simply by ignoring the subsequent close calls i.e., making them a noop).  I think that it's a decent fix as typically you would expect for a close operation on a resource. However, if some time we would want to investigate further where in gossip call is this happening multiple times and fix that, we can keep this Jira around.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In order to support config-like updates for the peer, it is necessary to define a new transaction type which is not an endorser transaction.  Most likely, this means defining a new transaction type: {{PEER_CONFIG_UPDATE}} or perhaps {{RESOURCE_CONFIG_UPDATE}} which embeds a {{common.ConfigUpdate}} as its payload data.  The protolator tool should also be extended to support this new type in the CR which adds it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I just did a quick audit and it looks like this is complete or nearly complete. The only remaining chaincode that does not use the _binary_ language (yuck) are:  nwo/network_test.go ledger/couchdb_indexes_test.go ledger/marbles_test.go sbe/sbe_test.go  The ledger tests will be handled by FAB-16737.  The SBE test needs to be reviewed. There are also e2e tests that continue to use "golang".  ></body> </Action>

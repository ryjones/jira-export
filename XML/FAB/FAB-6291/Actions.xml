<Action id="31164" issue="20991" author="c0rwin" type="comment" body="I think that proper behavior for peer stop trying to connect to the ordering service once it discovers that orderer is not allowing to connect, rather than to prevent from peer join the channel. The simple use case would be adding new org after a while, e.g. in config update block, hence joining new peer from new org after adding implementation for this will simply fail to add new organization flow." created="2017-09-26 07:30:02.0" updateauthor="c0rwin" updated="2017-09-26 07:30:02.0"/>
<Action id="31165" issue="20991" author="hangyu_fjh" type="comment" body=" ~C0rWin    ~yacovm Thanks for your comment. I have understood the situation. My understanding is that after adding new organization in the config update block, the client fetch the updated genesis block from orderer and then send it to the peer of that new organization.  I just wanted to prevent peer from creating new ledger of a channel it does not belong. I guess this might be a rare case. " created="2017-09-26 08:10:10.0" updateauthor="hangyu_fjh" updated="2017-09-26 08:11:39.0"/>

CDATA When trying to join peer to a channel by sending the genesis block, the peer doesn't check whether it belongs to the channel or not, which results peer creating the ledger of the channel even when it actually doesn't belong to the channel. And later on, the error messages keep coming from orderer because the credentials do not match.  So, peer should check the organization info of a genesis block before creating a new ledger. This also can avoid(partially) peer cli sending false information.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The tool is still in use by a small, but faithful community.  It receives little updates to the repo due to it being code complete and stable.  My preference would be to keep this as prominent as the rest of Fabric components.        ></body> </Action>

Are there any CI repercussions for archiving the repo today, breaking the mirror, and making the GitHub mirror into the primary development space?     https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaintool  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~greg.haskins  The code is moved; I invited you (and I see you accepted) over on GitHub.  The two options we've been exploring are Azure Pipelines (which is very close to GitHub actions in implementation) and GitLab CI. Would you like me to invite you to the Azure group so you can experiment with CI over there?     https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="63723" issue="42226" author="greg.haskins" type="comment" body="Sure, thanks Ry.  FWIW,  I am familiar with Gitlab CI (as well as a few others, like Travis and CircleCI).  I&apos;d be new to Azure, but thats fine.  One question:  Is the plan to try to unify all of Hyperledger (or at least -Fabric) on to one solution?  Or should I just seek to use whatever suits the -chaintool community?  If so, my inclination would be to just go with CircleCI as it is quite competent for the use case.  Let me know" created="2019-09-12 15:03:24.0" updateauthor="greg.haskins" updated="2019-09-12 15:03:24.0"/>

If you like we have another org - hyperledger-cicd - where we have been testing stuff. I can add you there as an owner so you can test without worrying about the main repo.

CDATA  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/13909/   Fixed smoke tests and timings as specified below.  Note these 10 scenarios in DAILY suite still fail: 5 chaincodes.feature scenarios (due to bug FAB-6271) FAB-4720,FAB-4721,FAB-4722,FAB-5790 parts 3,4 2 gossip.feature scenarios FAB-4663,FAB-4667 for disconnect issues being investigated by Adnan 3 orderer.feature scenarios for FAB-4770 failing intermittently (due to orderer bug FAB-6335) # Moved tests from smoke.feature into bootstrap.feature, and removed file smoke.feature. # Combined a couple smoke tests containing duplication. # Removed a tag for a test so it is not run for both the smoke and daily test suites. # Standardized and fixed up some peer.feature tests that were failing in CI test automation runs: - 2 failed tests, FAB-1440 - failed query after deploy; inserted sleep to allow instantiation - 2 failed tests, FAB-3505 - failed query after 1st invoke; inserted sleep before query - 2 failed tests, FAB-3865 - failed invoke/query - added sleep to allow instantiation time for a specified cc, and to allow time for invoke transactions to be batched and delivered before queried - 2 failed tests, FAB-3866 - failed invoke/query - same as above # Set delays after bootstrap a network, for all tests, to wait 5s for solo, 30s for kafka. And set delay of 15s for all tests after each deploy to allow time to start running the cc in the newly created container. # Enhanced some Scenario Outline titles, to include the parameter variables # Skipped the tests that set environment variables AND verified them. Although passing, something was not getting cleaned up because any test executed afterwards (in either the CI smoke test suite or the daily tests) often failed during setup or deploy. # Removed brackets from titles where unneeded.  ></body> </Action>

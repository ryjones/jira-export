CDATA  ~SharedMocha  It is already possible to specify that TLS is required, see: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations_service.html#operations-security  If that doesn't address the concern, could you clarify what is still missing?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~denyeart  Thanks for your comments.  I will add the config metrics to docker container and test it and confirm.  One of the issues I see is, Prometheus or stand containers are required to be part of the fabric bridge network for getting metrics from peers and orderer. Is there a way we can pull metrics without adding them to fabric bridge network?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~denyeart    According to docs - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/operations_service.html   I am able to enable TLS. But I keep running into an issue  that asks me for client/mutual auth even though I didn't enable it. My goal is to setup HTTPS for operating service but not enable client auth. Let me know if I should close this and create a separate defect for that  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~SharedMocha  The same document says:  "When TLS is enabled, a valid client certificate must be provided in order to access all resources unless explicitly noted otherwise below."  "When clientAuthRequired is also enabled, the TLS layer will require a valid client certificate regardless of the resource being accessed."  So, you must have a client cert for most of the operations when TLS is enabled.  This appears to be working as expected, so I'll close the issue.  ></body> </Action>

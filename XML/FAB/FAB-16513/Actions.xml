What did you mean with multiple versions of genesis block? I had my network up and running, then on an orderer, I needed to resize my disk due to low space and after a restart, all files are in there, but orderer throws this error for some channel. Other channels were restored just fine. " created="2021-09-16 15:34:18.0" updateauthor="kopaygorodsky" updated="2021-09-16 15:34:18.0"/>

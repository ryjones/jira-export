CDATA Using image: x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2  Not sure how to break this behavior in multiple bug. And I'm not sure if this is fixed in any future release. Couldn't see anything mentioned in Release Notes  *Issue 1:* Chaincode container restarts automatically.  *Issue 2:* Post restart, Fabric enters a limbo state where either of these two happen * When we try to create a new asset via Nodejs SDK - transaction times out during endorsement stage * If endorsement is successful, then I can see a success message from peer. But then, orderer prints error message as -   {noformat} transport: http2Server.HandleStreams failed to receive the preface from client: EOF {noformat}  Consequence of this:  * Cannot perform stable transaction on the network * post multiple attempts (without restarting) the network - if successful, block is not pushed to all peers  Will attach logs.    ></description> </Issue>

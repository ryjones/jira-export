CDATA We are experiencing a timeout issue on HSBN (running Fabric Alpha1 with setup 2 peers, 2 CAs and 3 orderer). It is taking too much time for the order to sync block back to the peers. It just freezes after sending payload to orderer. Each time this happens, we restart the peers to pick up the commit block. Of course, this is not a feasible solution. Jim and Murali team are aware of this issue.  There is nothing we can debug or see in our end. We have already taken Jim and Paul what we have done and has shown to them also the peers were able to pick up committed block after restarting the peers. In our end, we cannot see any error information. It is very difficult for us to tell this particular challenge is related to either Node or Java SDK or HSBN issue.  We would like to understand why it takes so long the peers to sync up with the block. And, is it possible to increase “the block commit time” so that we monitor how it behaves? Please note that we don’t have any problem in a local machine (4 peers, 2 CAs and one orderer) and SL VM - everything works!  ></description> </Issue>

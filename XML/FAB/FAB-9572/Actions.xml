CDATA Actually I just tried and there is a small problem but this merely affects the README. Indeed, the README instructs to comment out the command line from the docker-compose file but that's not how it's done anymore. Instead, the BYFN script is run from byfn.sh through docker exec so it's that line that needs to be commented out instead.  I'll submit a CR.  Thanks.     ></body> </Action>

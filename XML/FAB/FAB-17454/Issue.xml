CDATA JOB_TYPE=PROFILE make unit-test ends up with a "Nothing to test!!!" message, and no test cases will run at all.  The issue is the combined effect set by "set -e -o pipefail" and the function join_by returning status code 1 from    "$#" -ne 0    when join_by is called with only 1 arg. And that's the case when JOB_TYPE=PROFILE, conditional_packages is set to an empty array so join_by is called with just the delimiter.  ></description> </Issue>

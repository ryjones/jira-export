CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to chain the API calls when attempting to update or retrieve values in the config. Currently the ConfigTx type supports all of the add/remove/set/update functions for all values on the config. Let's consider extending sub types with their associated getters and setters so we change from calling:  c.AddAnchorPeers(...) -> c.Application().Org(orgName).AddAnchorPeer()  Use careful consideration when determining how to and which types to wrap for the intermediary subtypes. In the example above, should ConfigTx contain references to a configtx.Application type which wraps a ConfigGroup proto?  Â   *Acceptance*  I can chain API calls for getting/setting values on a config. The examples and GoDoc should be updated accordingly.  ></description> </Issue>

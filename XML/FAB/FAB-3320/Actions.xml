CDATA This Jira was opened to pass on logs (described in issue) and this issue is somewhat a explained to have a same root cause where we see a Peer Timeout (user-chaincode and peer container connection). As per  ~jimthematrix  the connection between orderer and peer committer is lost and hence keep-alive needs to be activated or exposed as configuration.   However from the orderer logs - last three lines are not seen in the world-state ledger. {quote}  36m2017-04-21 17:13:56.905 UTC  orderer/ramledger  appendBlock -> DEBU 13e1 0m Sending signal that block 22 has a successor  36m2017-04-21 17:13:56.905 UTC  orderer/common/deliver  Handle -> DEBU 13e2 0m Delivering block for (0xc4202f5de0) channel: bar  36m2017-04-21 17:13:56.905 UTC  orderer/common/deliver  Handle -> DEBU 13e3 0m Delivering block for (0xc420300be0) channel: bar {quote}   Can you please check with Jim.  ></body> </Action>

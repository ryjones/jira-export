CDATA My comments after reading/working with "Getting Started"    http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html  *  ok, so i don't lose my thoughts, will place here what i'm experiencing.. *  i'm doing thigns manually, so i am not really interested in the e2e part of the script *  (i..e. i comment out the command: in the docker-compose script *  1. pass a moderately high value for TIMEOUT (give me a clue, 60, 120?) or longer if... what effects if i need to make this longer? *  2. Tell me what the docker-compose does, tell me that it spins up 1 orderer, and 4 peers, 2 per organization, and 1 cli *  3. tell me a bit about CLI -- this is there because? (I think it is there because it is the only way to communicate with the network, the only other way to communicate with the network is through SDK? I think *  the 4 environment variables are really clunky *  it would be great to have a "switch script" somewhere for this... but of course, explaining *  what are tehse environment variables for? that would help people understand a bit... what is MSPCONFIGPATH, LOCALMSPID, ROOTCERT_FILE.... *  4. this line is confusing "you can mount your own configuration transaction with a different name" *  at this point, i have no idea what a configuration transaction is... *  this line "This command returns a genesis block - ...- which we will use to join the channel" *  I wo uld say "This command creates a local file <channel-ID.block> that contains the channel genesis block (aside: , genesis blocks are not described anywhere in this document and use everywhere...), The channel genesis block is used when a peer joins a channel." *  installing sample go code on the peers does not tell me where you are getting the chaincode from. I am assuming now that it is coming from  github.com|http://github.com/ , (the real github, not some local file system?), but I'm not really sure...  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Install and Instantiate:  First, explain at a high level the mycc chaincode does.  Just to give context, and what this section teaches.  Second, more attention to install and instantiate – in particular instantiate.  I always tell customers that instantiate is making the meta-data or signature of the chaincode known to all peers on a channel, and it is also where the endorsement policy for a given use of chaincode is defined (i.e. you can have different endorsement policies for different channels)     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Switching environment variables — woah – this is not only tedious, but confusing.... But there is an exercise that will help the user understand a bit more of the setup.    Have them create this script in scripts.   ^setglobals.sh   and run it on the cli peer as  . scripts/setglobals.sh 1 /* add the peer org1.peer1  to the channel */  . scripts/setglobals.sh 2  /* add the peer org2.peer0  to the channel */  . scripts/setglobals.sh 3  /* add peer org2.peer1 to the channel */  . scripts/setglobals.sh 0  <--- resets us back to org1.peer0.  A few things to note. they can create this script on their local machine, but they need to actually 'exec' into the cli container.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA There is a lot of good information in the section: h3. "What’s happening behind the scenes?"  While I personally really like encouraging the manual exercising of the commands as that is how you really learn what is going on, adding the commentary in the 'What's happening behind the sceneds" session to the manual directions would be very helpful.  Is there a way to do this elegantly and integrate the "What's happening behind the scenes" section to the manual process, and then 'pull it all together' with teh scripts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've uploaded a tar file which containsÂ the following files:  # {{initial.pb}}: A proto encoded common.Config structure # {{initial.json}}: A JSON decoding of initial.pb # {{final.pb}}: A proto encoded common.Config structure which adds an additional chaincode # {{final.json}}: A JSON decoding of final.pb # {{update.pb}}: A proto encoded common.ConfigUpdate structure # {{update.json}}: A JSON decoding of update.pb  Essentially, {{initial.pb}} might be an initial resources tree.  {{final.pb}} would be how that resources tree would be modified to add a new chaincode, and {{update.pb}} would be the computed update to transition from {{initial.pb}} to {{final.pb}}.  Note:  The names for the Endorsement and Validation messages may change prior to alpha, as may the name of the proto message which is encoded as the argument to the Validation message.  Since these are name changes only though, this should be very little work if modified.  ></body> </Action>

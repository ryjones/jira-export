CDATA I attempt to install chaincode onto a peer through the node sdk but instead of using a peer admin cert, I use a cert obtained from the CA (which would be valid for submitting transactions). This should fail and it does fail however the node sdk returns no error message to indicate the issue you only get an Error object with no message. This could be an issue with the peer itself not sending back any useful error message rather than a problem with the node sdk.  Specifically using Hyperledger Composer, the response to the user looks like {code:java} Error: error trying to deploy. Error: error trying to install chaincode. Error {code} Â The final Error part would contain the response from hyperledger fabric but as seen here there is no message  ></description> </Issue>

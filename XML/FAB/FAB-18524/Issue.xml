CDATA Certificate management is a critical part of Hyperledger Fabric.  Often users don't know all the identities/certificates in play, the default expiration, or how to renew them.  In addition, if certificates are allowed to expire, it can be complicated and also a bit dangerous renewing them since, as with orderer TLS certs for example, if it isn't done properly it's possible that a user can get in a situation where the environment can't be recovered.     For this reason, I believe there should be some sample scripts and documentation provided to cover both these cases.  The documentation should list the various certificates that someone operating a fabric environment would have to keep track of and the scripts can help renew and also allow someone to fix expired certificates.     Since many production environments run on kubernetes, I'd suggest tying this with https://jira.hyperledger.org/FAB-18523 and providing documentation and scripts that can be used in a kubernetes environment vs one that assumes everything is running on a single node and local filesystem.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Presently, Fabric reserves portions of the state db namespace through the LSCC table.  This assumes that all of the reserved namespaces are restricted to user chaincodes.  This is not the case generally, and will become even less so as Fabric gains more features.  Because of this, lifecycle should be built on a more basic principle that namespaces in the state database are reserved.  ></description> </Issue>

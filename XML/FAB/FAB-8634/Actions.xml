CDATA  ~zhaochy  We have to distinguish between a new transaction with the same transaction ID and a recursion and if the later need to think about level of nesting to prevent a call going rogue. I'll take a look at this over the the next few days to study what this means.   ~kchristidis   ~mastersingh24  there is definitely an element of risk to doing this late (even if well understood). Would you consider this is late for 1.2 ?  ></body> </Action>

This does seem late for 1.2, hence the "Future" "Fix Version".  Once you assess the amount of work involved, post here, and we can hopefully contain this in 1.3.  ></body> </Action>

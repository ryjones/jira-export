CDATA let the symbol *"=>"* stands for *invokeChaincode* current fabric-peer only supports cc1 => cc2 and get response  but sometimes we may meet the following scenario:  1.  cc1 => cc2 => cc3 (no circle) 2.  cc1 => cc2 => cc1 (with circle)  for scenario 1, cc2 => cc3 does not work for scenario 2, cc2 => cc1 does not work  It seems current fabric-peer does not support embedded cross-chaincode invoke, this feature should be added.  ></description> </Issue>

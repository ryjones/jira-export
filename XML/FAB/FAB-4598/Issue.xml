CDATA Currently at dev environment or CI environment, fabric network is always an all-in-one network, all components run on one node which is not how real fabric network will be in production. This project will develop a set of ansible scripts to allow one easily build, deploy, test fabric on multiple nodes. All the following items will be dynamic: # Number of nodes (servers) which fabric will run on, either provisioned from a cloud or existing nodes. # Number of organizations. # Number of each component such as peers, orderers. # Number of kafka nodes participating in one kafka cluster.  Here is the flow of the script: # Provisioning virtual nodes from a cloud if desired (can be skipped if using existing node) # Initialize all the nodes with installation of all required libraries and software # Configure overlay network flannel to ensure containers can communicate with each other on different node # Configure hostnames # Build fabric binaries and images # Generate various keys, certificates # Deploy containers onto each node according to the configuration # Run various tests  ></description> </Issue>

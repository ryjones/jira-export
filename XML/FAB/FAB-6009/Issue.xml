CDATA We need to have a user-friendly way to create a IdemixMSPConfig out of issuer credential, the same way we do for the FabricMSPConfig.   This is to be used later on to feed config blocks.   As soon as this capability is in, IdexmiMSP would be usable by Fabric nodes that run a version with Idemix MSP.   Therefore, we indicate this item is blocked by FAB-5556.  ></description> </Issue>

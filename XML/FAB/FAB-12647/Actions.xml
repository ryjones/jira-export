CDATA *00:01:47.524* (line  175) broken     https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeInterface.html  - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url:  https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeInterface.html    The above URL (and the others in this report with a similar URL pattern) is reached without a redirect via the following URL:    https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeInterface.html  -- without the "_*fabric-shim.*_".    Can we update each of the fabric-shim.github.io links in the documentation with this URL?   Second would be this link:   *00:01:57.011* (line   51) broken     https://www.virtualbox.org/  - ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))   This link reported as broken. I checked it and it works, but yesterday, it took a longer time for the page to load. With that, I'll submit a patch that will increase the link timeout value.   Last is this one:   *00:02:00.397* (line  155) broken     https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/release-1.3/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/gocc/sample1/src/github.com/example_cc/example_cc.go  - 404 Client   The above link reports as broken, which is correct- it indeed returns a 404.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/27347      Also I searched all the docs for ` https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.|https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeInterface.html ` and found no other hits.  Still outstanding:  Checking with  ~rickr  to see what the correct link would be for the Java SDK in the in  idemix.rst and then I will update it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA /cc  ~pandrejko ,  ~rameshthoomu ,  ~odowdaibm   After running the linkchecker on the Sandbox, we discovered that this change was still broken. There are 3 URLs that still need to be addressed:  - https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-contract-api.Contract.html  {color:red}<-- cannot find this one at all.{color} - https://fabric-shim.github.io/fabric-shim.ChaincodeInterface.html - https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeStub.html  The last two fabric-shim URLs were fixed with the following patch set: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27504/  The linkchecker runs on the Sandbox now, only failing with 1 broken link reported- which is the URL mentioned above: https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/3/console.log.gz   ~pandrejko  Can we find out what this URL should be? I have a patch that I can use to update it, I just need to know what the URL should be. This way we can finally get this JIRA task completed/merged.  ></body> </Action>

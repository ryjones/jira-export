CDATA We pass lockbasedtxmgr to the validator so that the validator can get a tx simulator to execute the post-order transaction. As this is a side-effect, we need to run the post-order execution within the lockbasedtxmgr and only use validator to perform the serializability check.   When we do that, we can remove the TxSimulatorProvider interface from the valimpl.   ></description> </Issue>

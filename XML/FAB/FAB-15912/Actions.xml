CDATA  ~ryjones  what is the requirement regarding branch/releases?  The two linked issues have been solved in master branch, corresponding to our upcoming v2.0 release of hyperledger fabric. We still maintain branch release-1.4 as well. If the security issues must be addressed there as well, then just reopen and we can try to address them too. However, I am hoping not to go back to update all the previous release branches.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~scottz  that is a question for your release management team. I can't answer it. If 1.4 is supported, it probably needs ported? Not sure.  Â   ></body> </Action>

I will port them to 1.4, just in case. If you still get "security alert" emails for fabric-test repo after tomorrow, they will be based on the fact that the tools exist in previous release branches of the code base, and so we can ignore them. But will we be able to differentiate those alerts from any new alerts for new code in latest release?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The TX for instantiate needs to be validated.  At the moment an instantiation TX looks like the following:  {noformat} +--------------------------+ |instantiate transaction   | |--------------------------|	 |- submitter signature     | |- endorsements            | |  - signed by P1...x      | |  - instantiation arg     | |  - RW set with           | |    - cc name, version    | |    - cc fingerprint (id) | +--------------------------+ {noformat}  Checks that need to be done at endorsement time: * The tx submitter needs to satisfy the CC instantiation policy stored in the SignedCDSPackage on disk * In case of a CC upgrade, the tx submitter needs to satisfy the CC instantiation policy of the currently instantiated CC * For this, the RW set of the tx needs to be enhanced with the instantiation policy (the corresponding chaincode package might no longer be on the disk of the endorsing peer).  Checks at commit time are part of FAB-3155  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Considering the use case where your Peers and Orderers  are behind a firewall  and connect internally and clients SDKs should connect via other endpoints provided via firewall service. Service discovery should allow in discovery data only the external endpoints of the Orderer.  There seems to be a solution for peers with CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT.  The equivalent should be provided  for the Orderer.   This actually happens when using docker too.  Currently the SDKs have a *solution* to remap all addresses reported by service discovery which are the internal endpoints to localhost.   CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT would be solution for that for peers but nothing seems equivalent for Orderers.   ></description> </Issue>

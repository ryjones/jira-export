CDATA The peer writes its pid into a file at startup.  There is really no need for that: * If the peer runs in a container, its pid will be 1, and anyway the peer container can be stopped without knowing the pid file * If the peer runs outside a container, its pid file can be discovered by commands like *fuser* or *lsof* that correlate the peer's log file, and files it opened. Similar argument towards *netstat -nlop*.   I think it's better to remove this pid file altogether.   ></description> </Issue>

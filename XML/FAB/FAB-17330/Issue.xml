CDATA This is a test scenario using fabric-test Operator + PTE, in k8s cluster: * k8s samplecc_2chan (refer to existing test in automation suite) * Use Operator to launch a small network (minimum 3 orderers, 2 orgs and 2 peers per org), preferably in k8s cluster * Configure using raft, couchdb, 2 channels, multiple thrds, samplecc golang chaincode * Use PTE to execute invokes, and calculate TPS and confirm all transactions are successful.

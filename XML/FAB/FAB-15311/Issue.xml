CDATA https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging-control.html  {code} In pretty-printed logs the logging level is indicated both by color and by a four-character code, e.g, “ERRO” for ERROR, “DEBU” for DEBUG, etc. In the logging context a logger is an arbitrary name (string) given by developers to groups of related messages. In the pretty-printed example below, the loggers ledgermgmt, kvledger, and peer are generating logs.  :: 2018-11-01 15:32:38.268 UTC  ledgermgmt  initialize -> INFO 002 Initializing ledger mgmt 2018-11-01 15:32:38.268 UTC  kvledger  NewProvider -> INFO 003 Initializing ledger provider 2018-11-01 15:32:38.342 UTC  kvledger  NewProvider -> INFO 004 ledger provider Initialized 2018-11-01 15:32:38.357 UTC  ledgermgmt  initialize -> INFO 005 ledger mgmt initialized 2018-11-01 15:32:38.357 UTC  peer  func1 -> INFO 006 Auto-detected peer address: 172.24.0.3:7051 2018-11-01 15:32:38.357 UTC  peer  func1 -> INFO 007 Returning peer0.org1.example.com:7051 An arbitrary number of loggers can be created at runtime, therefore there is no “master list” of loggers, and logging control constructs can not check whether logging loggers actually do or will exist. {code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The transaction validator uses a "weighed semaphore" implementation from "golang.org/x/sync/semaphore". Since we don't use the weighting function, we don't need the complexity; this can be replaced by a simple buffered channel implementation.  Further, the current structure is broken. The semaphore is allocated in the peer as a package global and then passed down via the - wait for it - *support* structure to the validator. The only user is the validator so this should not be a global. Further, it's a bit of an implementation detail.  So, this is two things: fix the code and replace the dep.  ></description> </Issue>

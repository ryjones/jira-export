Default properties need not be picked up from core.yaml. In 1.0 architecture, the peer no longer builds the chaincode package but only passes it to docker to deploy (the package is built by CLI or SDK). In this mode the core.yaml in the Dockerfile will typically not be available in the peer environment." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-01-16 06:10:35.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:11:13.0" resolutiondate="2017-01-20 00:40:03.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="37045"/>

CDATA PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2183   1) The collection name is not being logged?  A: fixed  2) Is Error really the correct level for this log?  A: The specific message should be at error level, but fromTransientStore should not be called when txid is empty (see next question).  3) Why is the transaction id null?  A: there are 2 scenarios (commit and reconciliation) when `height <= blockNum` is true. In the reconciliation case, the transaction id is null and SeqInBlock is used. In this case, we should not retrieve from transient store. The PR has updated the code to log a message and skip calling fromTransientStore.  ></body> </Action>

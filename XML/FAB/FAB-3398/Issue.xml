CDATA Improve unit test coverage for ledger.   There will be a subtask per ledger package.  Developers can pick up any available package subtask to work on. As each package is inspected, tests can also be refactored and ledger testutil assertions can be replaced with github.com/stretchr/testify/assert assertions.  Eventually we will be able to remove ledger testutil.  ></description> </Issue>

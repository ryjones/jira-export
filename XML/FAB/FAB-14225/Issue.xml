CDATA Run traffic on different channels configured with partly overlapping consenters sets. h2. Setup: # Define a fabric network with: ## etcd/raft with 7 OSNs (3 in ordererorg1 and remaining 4 in ordererorg2) ## minimum 1 peer in 1 org # Configure the network with all the 7 OSNs in the {{orderersystemchannel}} consenter set. # Batch size=10 # Create a configtx.yml file with 3 orgchannels in profiles ## OrgChannel1 (With orderer1st, orderer2nd, and orderer3rd) ## OrgChannel2 (With orderer2nd, orderer3rd, and orderer4th) ## OrgChannel3 (With orderer5th, orderer6th, orderer7th) # Bring up all the orderers # Create three application channels ## Channel1(Using OrgChannel1 profile) ## Channel2(Using OrgChannel2 profile) ## Channel3(Using OrgChannel3 profile)  h2. Inputs # In PTE, create 3 SC files(1 per each channel respectively). # Start traffic, generating 40K transactions on each channel.   h2. Expectations # Verify all the orderers in each channel has the same number of blocks. # All nodes remain in service throughout the test. # No errors in the logs of peers and orderers. # No failures or errors reported by PTE.  ></description> </Issue>

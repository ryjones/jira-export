CDATA This is a known bug, because the transaction format is in flux.  Essentially, unless a proto message type is known, unmarshaling it will have undefined results, not necessarily resulting in an error.  Here, things which are not configuration transactions (but are also not `Envelope` messages) are unmarshaling to look like configuration transactions.  But, because they are not 'valid', the filter is correctly throwing them out.  Once the fabric transactions onto the new transaction format, this should resolve itself.  ></body> </Action>

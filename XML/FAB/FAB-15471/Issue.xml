CDATA Most behave tests fail in v1.4 smoke and daily test suites, with this error:  Assertion Failed: Unable to find the genesis block file behavesystest.block  The channel creation transaction is created as behavesystest.tx, submitted, and then the block from the ledger is fetched and normally saved locally as behavesystest.block (where it can be used by next steps, but that is where the error occurs). The behavesystest.tx does appear to be created ok, but must determine where the failure occurred - channel creation problem, or problem with the behavesystest.tx transaction artifact generated by configtxgen, or in the channel transaction handling inside fabric.  ></description> </Issue>

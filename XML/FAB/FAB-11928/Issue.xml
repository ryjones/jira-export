CDATA Add a new function in the chaincode library that allows the caller get back attribute values from an Idemix Credential. Currently only two attributes are supported for Idemix, they are 'ou' and 'role'.  Chaincode can continue to use the GetAttributeValue function to get back values for attributes. For Idemix, the only attributes that are going to be available will be 'ou' and 'role'.  Also, the cid and attrmgr code was moved down to the shim to make it easier for chaincode writers by removing extra dependencies they have to import.  ></description> </Issue>

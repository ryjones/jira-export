CDATA The programming model docs “fabric/docs/source/developapps/smartcontract.md” has duplicated lines. The duplicated lines should be removed.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/6037aaa97479a993ed9286e3da7641769e343132/docs/source/developapps/smartcontract.md#the-contract-class  Duplicated lines {noformat} Notice also how the class constructor uses its superclass to initialize itself with a namespace:  constructor() { super('org.papernet.commercialpaper'); } This can be really helpful if papercontract.js contained multiple smart contracts, as transactions with the same name can be scoped by their namespace to disambiguate them. {noformat}   ></description> </Issue>

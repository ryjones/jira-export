CDATA Once transaction of configuration update of Type B being propagated, we need to make sure there are no more than single change of consenters set, namely we could either add or remove one node at a time.  After Raft cluster consent on the configuration block leader has to extract configuration update and Propose it for cluster so configuration update will actually take effect on replica set, there is also need to reconfigure communication layer with new nodes.  Raft should not proceed further processing of incoming transactions and writing them to the blocks until configuration update will take place. Hence update of configuration suppose to be blocking procedure.  ></description> </Issue>

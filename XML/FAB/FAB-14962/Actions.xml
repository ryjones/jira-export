CDATA Comments addressed in this CR:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30986/   Responding to specific points:  1) This was already addressed  2) I specify the peer installed in the sentence below: Now install the chaincode package onto peer0 of Org2.  3) Good suggestion. Done.  4) I am going to keep the language in the docs because the hash is not created by the peer, it is created deterministically by the peer.Â  However, that process may be different for different users.  5) Addressed by removing gossip. Not necessary in the sentence.  6) This has been addressed.  7) Good suggestion. Section rewritten in the CR above.  ></body> </Action>

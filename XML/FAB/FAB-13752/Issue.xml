CDATA  ~mastersingh24  recently changed how docker images are built for fabric and it looks like a lot of whatâ€™s in docker-env.mk is now abandoned; perhaps some of it was unintentional.  For example, DOCKER_DYNAMIC_LINK and DOCKER_GO_LDFLAGS no longer get used.  I noticed this while chasing down if and how we build static binaries of the peer and orderer in master.   I expect there may be additional things to cleanup as well.  /cc  ~mastersingh24   ></description> </Issue>

I've tried backing out the changes to revert to using older sdk-node modules and I just can't get it to work, I'm not sure how it worked in the first place. I've tried the following versions of node-sdk modules: 2.0.0-beta.2, 2.1.0, 2.0.0-beta.4 and 1.4.8. Each of them fail to build the project for various reasons, usually type issues.   So I guess the best avenue is to fix why discovery is failing, as per the issue described above, rather than try to back out and use older versions. I think this blocks the fabric-contract-api-go v2.1.0 release? TBC  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A placeholder feature to improve command output.     The peer channel command (and indeed all subcommands), should # Provide a clear indication of whether the command has succeeded or failed # Have some level of helpful INFO messages that return helpful information on command progress.   I'm happy to expand here on what these need to be, but for now, I've just opened this JIRA as a placeholder.  ></description> </Issue>

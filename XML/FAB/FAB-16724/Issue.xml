CDATA Convert regression/smoke/systest_pte.pyÂ to a golang test driver. This uses the NL and PTE.  At same time, we could improve/modify the test, such as converting to use raft instead of kafka. And, ensure the PTE returns a pass/fail response that includes validation as currently done with the assertions in the systest_pte.py python file.  Note: The runSmokeTestSuite.sh already incorporates an end-to-end test using operator/launcher/PTE tools (after FAB-16997 gets merged). We could also run another golang test to execute the existing NL/PTE smoke test.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="46540" issue="31330" author="scottz" type="comment" body=" ~dongming  : Does PTE print a log when a transaction event is received which is a duplicate? Or print a log if it is unknown? If it is easy to get those logs, then that is probably the easiest way to debug this to identify the extra transaction. We say this problem with OTE too, but very rarely, and we would have to implement something very similar to how PTE catalogs and checks off events from a complete list. We will probably also need to turn up and examine all the orderer logs and maybe the kafka logs... but let&apos;s try to get some info from the PTE first." created="2018-06-26 13:14:33.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-06-26 13:14:33.0"/>

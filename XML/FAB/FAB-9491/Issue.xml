CDATA  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html?highlight=endorsement%20policy      From J. Yellick  This has been a long outstanding deficiency in our examples and documentation, so sorry for the confusion it has been causing.     It makes absolutely no sense to include the 'Admin' role in an endorsement policy. Admins are user identities, while endorsement is done by peer identities. In v1.0 of Fabric, there were only two roles available, 'Member', and 'Admin'. So, when trying to construct an example which demonstrated that different roles could be specified inside of a policy, we ended up specifying the 'Admin' role, which sadly, makes no sense for an endorsement policy. (Note, there are other policies in the system, such as those governing channel configuration where the 'Admin' role makes sense). In v1.1 of Fabric, new role types were introduced, particularly the 'Peer' and 'Client' roles. I strongly suggest that if your crypto material was generated with support for these new roles that you should utilize the 'Peer' role in your endorsement policies. A better example of a policy with mixed roles would be "Org1.Member AND Org2.Peer". This would make sense for an endorsement policy where Org1's certificates do not distinguish the 'Peer' role, but Org2's certificates do.  ></description> </Issue>

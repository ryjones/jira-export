CDATA I believe the original idea is to distinguish the user roles from common member to specific admin when doing the endorsement.  However, I agree the one who really does endorsement is the peer. So maybe what we want to clarify here is "a member role peer" or "an admin role peer"?  This triggers another problem to me: the way to define an "admin" role, which might be more flexible by defining a specific admin attribution inside the certificate, instead of checking local MSP.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Another question around this recently in the Hyperledger e-mail chat and Jason's response:  Please do not use admin roles in endorsement policies. It makes no sense, as a peer isn't a person and admin roles is used for administrative operations by human beings.  Peer role means that the identity that endorsed the transaction belongs to an OU that is marked as a peer OU in the MSP configuration. It's a feature that exists starting from v1.1 Client role is defined in a similar manner.   ~negupta   ~joe-alewine   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~pandrejko  That comment was actually made by Yacov, and what I think he's getting at is that endorsement policies should list peers — e.g. `Org1.Peer` — and not something like `Org1.Admin`. This is because peers actually do the endorsing, not admins. Of course, we tend to conflate these concepts because peers are administered by an admin, but in this case signing an endorsement is not really a "decision" in the sense that we usually think of it. It's more of a function that will be performed if everything (signatures, packaging, formatting etc) has been done correctly. The peer checks these things and then "automatically" (meaning, there's no human value judgement involved) endorses the proposal.  At least, this is my understanding.  ></body> </Action>

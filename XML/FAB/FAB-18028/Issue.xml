CDATA {{core/peer/config.go}} defines the following configuration structure:  {code:go} // ExternalBuilder represents the configuration structure of // a chaincode external builder type ExternalBuilder struct { 	EnvironmentWhitelist   string `yaml:"environmentWhitelist"` 	Name                 string   `yaml:"name"` 	Path                 string   `yaml:"path"` } {code}  We should create a new key to capture the environment variables to propagate and deprecate the existing one. The field should be renamed as well (leaving only the tag) to include some indication that it has been intentionally removed.  At runtime, if the new key is set, it will supersede the old. Documentation and test fixtures should also be updated to use the new {{propagateEnvironment}} key.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a developer I need the ability to specify who can sign off(endorse) my transactions and how many signatures (3 out of 5, 5 out of 7, etc) are needed before submitting my transaction so that I can eliminate a single point of authority and/or failure while allowing only endorsers I trust to simulate my transactions.   * Implement basic endorsement policies. Basic endorsement policies should be very static to begin with, e.g., a fixed set of endorsers' signatures is needed to endorse a transaction (e.g., t endorsers out of n). * Explore more robust endorsement policy specifications (but not too robust - we do not want another chaincode in the endorsement policy).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Looks like some NodeOU code was propped to 1.4 which is leading to failures. Tests use Enabled NodeOUs for the peers already. The tests do not use 1.4.3 channel capabilities yet. Tests regen the cryptoconfig, which means the admin certs will be missing, which leads to failure to create channels.  We can use this bug to update tests to turn on capabilities for v1.4.3 so the code will find the adminOUs certs in their new location for the peers. And we can enable NodeOUs for the orderers too, to use the full feature.  ></body> </Action>

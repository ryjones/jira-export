CDATA Background: * When upgrading from 1.x to 2.0/2.1(running "peer node upgrade-dbs" command), it automatically drops state leveldbs, but not couchdbs. Therefore, administrators have to drop state couchdbs separately. This may complicate the upgrade process.  Acceptance criteria: * During 1.x to 2.x upgrade (running "peer node upgrade-dbs" command), automatically drop couch dbs. * The dropped state couchdbs are rebuilt successfully upon peer restart.  ></description> </Issue>

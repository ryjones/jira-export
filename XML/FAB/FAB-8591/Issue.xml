CDATA *Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error authorizing update: error validating ReadSet: readset expected key  Group   /Channel/Application at version 0, but got version 1*     I'm running BYFN and found that when I run the command   peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME -f ./channel-artifacts/channel.tx --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem  it fails with the error listed above.     After spending alot of time debugging this we found out that the problem was that the command was failing because the channel already existed (since it had been already created by the docker-compose-cli.yaml script). We need to improve the error message     Can we change the text of this error message to be more specific. Something that includes the text like the 'Channel already exists'?           ></description> </Issue>

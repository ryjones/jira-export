CDATA While I agree with possibly improving this, it's not a bug.  Generally, we should not be revealing this much info, but at least it's very obscure.  In some circles, revealing that the channel exists is actually a security vulnerability.  I'm marking this for consideration as an improvement and pushing to v1.3.      ~kchristidis    ~jyellick  - what do you think?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Under the covers, channel creation is actually applying a config update to an ephemeral channel configuration.  If it's successful, the channel is created, if it's unsuccessful, the channel creation fails.  The reason we chose to approach it this way, was so that we could have a single, well vetted path for authorizing changes to configuration (as at channel creation time, the channel creator may or may not have authority to modify different fields -- for instance, a channel creation could set anchor peers for its the submitting org, but we would not want it to set anchor peers for another org).  We waffled on whether unauthorized access should be returned as 'unauthorized', or, whether we should obfuscate it with something like 'not found' but ultimately decided to return unauthorized.  In this case however, the submitter does have authority to submit transactions to this channel, otherwise the error would have been an immediate unauthorized.  but because the channel exists, it is treating the channel creation transaction as a config update against the real (non-ephemeral) configuration for the channel.   We could probably tweak the returned message to be a little more clear.  Something like:  BAD_REQUEST – channel <channel_id> will not be updated: error authorizing update: error validating ReadSet: readset expected key  Group   /Channel/Application at version 0, but got version 1  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've continued to get pinged by multiple people who cannot figure out this error message and are stuck.  The error message needs to make sense to a user and be actionable.  If the user has enough privilege to create a channel, they should have enough privilege to get an error message that says the channel they are trying to create has already been created.  As this is causing many users problems, I'm switching back to bug so that it can be fixed in v2.0.0 and v1.4.1.   ~jyellick   ~kchristidis   ></body> </Action>

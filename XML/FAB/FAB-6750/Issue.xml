CDATA Changes made to the protocols can have impact on the shims. As the node.js shim is built outside of the main fabric build, changes can occur which could break the shim and require changes.  This happened recently where a change was made to the GetState protocol but the shim wasn't updated and there was no indication that there was now a break in the shim.  As the shim publishes an unstable version to NPM which reflects changes to it, there is also the scenario where if a .proto file required by the shim is changed, a new unstable NPM module would need to be published as the build. The proto files are not part of the shim code base but rather pull them from the fabric code base. Maybe the fabric-chaincode-node build could be kicked off whenever a change to the .proto files are detected ?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This was discussed with  ~angelo.decaro ,  ~mathiasb303 ,  ~dubovitskaya ,  ~mdr ,  ~jyellick ,  ~keithsmith .     *Motivation*  In Fabric v1.0 we only dealt with enrollment identities that include in the clear information about their owner. However in v1.1 we support Identity Mixer MSP, that offers anonymous identities.  Currently, anonymous and enrollment identities are treated in the same way during policy evaluation, that may be problematic for policies that require consensus from t distinct clients, where t>2.  More specifically, it can be possible for a malicious client to sign a given (reconfiguration) request with two or more anonymous identities of its, and manage in this way to have such a policy satisfied erroneously by himself.     Making clear that by the properties of anonymous identities, their owner is hidden among all the owners of identities in that MSP, we should be able to specify policies that exclude anonymous identities, or specifically require enrollment identities to be satisfied.        *Solution*  The proposed solution consists of four components (each is reflected to a different sub-task of this epic): * Extension of MSPPrincipal to indicate anonymous identities * Extension of MSPPrincipal to include the definition of a CombinedPrincipal, i.e., a list of MSPPrincipals * Update of the implementation of SatisfiesPrincipal for the X.509 based MSP to account for the extended version of MSPPrincipal * Update of the implementation of SatisfiesPrincipal for the IdeMix MSP to account for the extended version of the MSPPrincipal  ></description> </Issue>

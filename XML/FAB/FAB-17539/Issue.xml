CDATA FAB-15840 was fixed in v1.4.2, but we have the same problem on this version (please, see steps to reproduce)  I checked:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/a282f7132565d509d3ba6d502cd9c07cc5e567f0/gossip/discovery/discovery_impl.go#L32  and found only 120 attempts to connect to anchor peers.

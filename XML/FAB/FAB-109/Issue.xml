CDATA There has been discussion around whether the .pb.go files should be removed from source control. The advantage is that if everyone was required to compile these files, they would always be in sync. The disadvantage is that this requires developers to use Vagrant (it's hard not to already) or requires that they install and use the correct version of protobuf as defined in the Vagrant setup script.   ~greg.haskins  nicely described why the decision to include the .pb.go files was originally made in a comment at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/483/  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA With the recent changes in fabric master branch, we are now publishing "fabric-baseos" image but we already have "fabric-baseos" image in fabric-baseimage repository and we use this image in all release branches.  If we now publish fabric-baseos to hyperledger dockerhub, release branches get the baseos image which has fabric code not fabric-baseimage.  I think we have to rename the fabric-baseos name to maintain uniqueness in the build flow.  ></description> </Issue>

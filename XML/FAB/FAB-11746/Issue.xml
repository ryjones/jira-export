CDATA When a peer send another peer a membership request, the latter responds with a membership response which is a snapshot of all alive messages that the former is considered to be eligible of receiving.  Currently, whenever the membership response is created -  the peer creates its own alive message|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/discovery/discovery_impl.go#L411  and attaches it to the membership response.  However - this results in signing a message, which is a waste.  Ideally we'd take advantage of the  periodical alive message generation|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/gossip/discovery/discovery_impl.go#L718-L730  in order to cache the produced alive messages and whenever a membership request comes - return the cached alive message instead of signing a new one.  ></description> </Issue>

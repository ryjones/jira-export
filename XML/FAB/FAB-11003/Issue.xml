CDATA I made fabric network with 4 nodes(linux1, linux2, linux3, linux4)   - each node has 2 peers(on linux1, linux2, linux3, linux4)   - total 3 orders are running(on linux1, linux2, linux3)   - 3 kafka, 3 zookeeper(on linux1, linux2, linux3)  (linux1, linux2, linux3, linux4 are physical linux boxes)  And 9 node.js applications are running to call invoke function in chaincode.  While I am testing, one of them among peer is stopped.  I traced them with "strace" command and I found that peer is stuck at futex() system call.  I guess they are under deadlock situation.  Of course I was trying to read source code, but... I am not used go-language.  Have you guys ever met this problem?  My fabric version is 1.2.0-rc1.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thanks for your interested Gari Singh..  Unfortunately I lost all logs and traces.  By the way I'm running my peers in docker, but not in docker swarm.  After I upgraded to v1.2.0, situations got better.(Even it work well more than 24 hours)  I think v 1.2.0 has still not so strong, but it is getting better.  Soon or later, hopefully, fabric will be more stable and better performance.  So we decide to concentrate on implementation our business.  Of course I will test Fabric with my test tools and report here.  Somehow,,, I want to contribute even small activities...  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The current ledger block storage metrics are all tied to kvledger.  This means they are only valid for the peer when in fact, both peers and orderers need this same sort of information.  This metric (along with similar metrics, like block storage times) should be moved to the block store component so that it is valid for both orderer and peer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the Building your first network tutorial we've the following: h3. Environment variables  For the following CLI commands against {{peer0.org1.example.com}} to work, we need to preface our commands with the four environment variables given below. These variables for {{peer0.org1.example.com}} are baked into the CLI container, therefore we can operate without passing them. *HOWEVER*, if you want to send calls to other peers or the orderer, then you can provide these values accordingly by editing the {{docker-compose-base.yaml}} before starting the container. Modify the following four environment variables to use a different peer and org. # Environment variables for PEER0   CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp   CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"   CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt   We must add the export command in front of the line above in order to minimize beginners mistakes. As an example,  if you don't set the CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH correctly, you may get the following error message: {quote}_Cannot run peer because cannot init crypto, folder "/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp" does not exist_ {quote}    ></description> </Issue>

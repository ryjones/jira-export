CDATA Change the orderer server boot sequence to determine clusterType from the system channel last config block or the bootstrap block, depending on which block number is higher.  We do this because after migration the bootstrap file will have ConsensusType.Type="kafka", whereas the system channel last config block will have ConsensusType.Type="etcdraft". If clusterType is not set to "etcdraft" at this point,  the creation of a raft consenter will fail later on.   ></description> </Issue>

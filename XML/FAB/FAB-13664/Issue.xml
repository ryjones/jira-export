CDATA I have a channel that has private collections. All the policies for the private collections and chaincode are 'OR'. Therefore, service discovery is not required for endorsement. Everything works correctly, chaincode and private chaincode, when service discovery is not enabled.   However, when service discovery is enabled private collections related chaincode doesn't work correctly and the results are wrong. What happens?     Is this a bug or should we do something extra? Unfortunately, I couldn't find any relevant documentation.     *Detailed description of the failing scenario.*  Given  - three different peers denoted as peerA, peerB, peerC - three different channels denoted as channelA, channelB, channelC. - a private collection that is implemented via private chaincode denoted as chaincodeA. - a function in chaincodeA denoted as functionA, that takes a channel name as a parameter.  and the backend for peerB calls functionA  of chaincodeA  with parameter ChannelB.  *no service discovery;* the request goes through as described. *with service discovery:* three different requests for each peer are logged. These are: 1. the backend for peerX calls functionA  of chaincodeA  with parameter ChannelA. 2. the backend for peerX calls functionA  of chaincodeA  with parameter ChannelB. 3. the backend for peerX calls functionA  of chaincodeA  with parameter ChannelC.  ></description> </Issue>

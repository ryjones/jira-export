CDATA Today it is rather tedious to do version upgrades in fabric, because a channel reconfiguration transaction must be constructed by hand, sometimes adding additional elements like ACLs to bring the system up to a new base level.  These config updates could be computed automatically by configtxgen, simplifying life for our  users.  As a rough flow, the user could pass in the latest config block for a channel and either pass in a target version, or a target profile.  Then configtxgen could compute the necessary update to upgrade the channel and write it out, like the anchor peers update.  ></description> </Issue>

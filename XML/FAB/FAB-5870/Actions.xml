CDATA I really think we need to define the minimum set of properties we need to set for a collection.  It seems that we have the following requirements: - Collection name (and/or id) - Orgs which will store the "data" for the collection - Minimum number of nodes data where data needs to reside to be acked  As an aside, can someone explain what  {noformat} Generic enough to cover any unlinkability property that makes sense to be added later (e.g., via specifying a collection type) {noformat} means?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~mastersingh24 ,   I updated the description of the JIRA item to map to the minimum requirements as you listed them.  Endorsement policy could make sense to be added here, but we can add it at a later point if/when we are all convinced that is needed.  This one:   > Generic enough to cover any unlinkability property that makes sense to be added later (e.g., via specifying a collection type)  aimed to refer to alternative (future) implementations of collections that would allow for stronger privacy features. The base implementation of such object would be as described in the sideDB document (no question about that), but our idea was that users of fabric can plug in in the future alternative implementations if they wish to (e.g., support for more collection object types).  ></body> </Action>

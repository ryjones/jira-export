CDATA This has been fixed recently. We are still not sure why s390x builds are unable to clone git://cloud.hyperledger.org/mirror/fabric.git  but with a work around we have fixed this by cloing fabric from github.com/hyperledger/fabric url with depth=1. Closing this issue for now.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, when a chain (follower/etcdraft) encounters an error  it cannot recover from, it panics, bringing the entire server down. This may cause other channels, which may be completely fine, to stop working, or to have reduced fault tolerance.   With the channel participation API, channels are effectively independent, yet multi-tenant on the same orderer. Therefore we want to move to a model in which when a chain (follower/etcdraft) encounters an error it cannot recover from, it will report it in the log, and exit leaving the chain with status = types.StatusError.   The new "List" API may be used by the admin to discover such events, and allow him to possibly handle the issue without interrupting other channels.     One may also consider to include the number of channels with status = types.StatusError in the metrics of the Registrar. This will allow the metrics reporting system to detect such failures and alert an operator.     ></description> </Issue>

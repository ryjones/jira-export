CDATA a few comments and nits on the Couchdb doc at  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/couchdb_as_state_database.html  1. Period missing after "with the index definition formatted in JSON following the CouchDB index JSON syntax 2. “Any index in the chaincode’s META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes directory will be packaged up and installed with the chaincode on a peer” ---It is not clear what this sentence tries to convey. Does “with” here means “at the same time”? this sentence seems to indicate that the index is installed on a peer (incorrect) which is clarified in a correct way in next sentence. 3. “... the index will automatically be deployed to the peer’s channel state database” more precisely, it is deployed to the peer’s chaincode-channel state database 4. “For CouchDB installations outside of the docker images supplied with Fabric, the local.ini file must be edited….” it’d be helpful to provide the location of local.ini file.  ></description> </Issue>

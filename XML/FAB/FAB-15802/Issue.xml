CDATA Observed that the existing PTE code does not read the channel information provided in the connection profile file.  Is this one symptom of a bigger problem? (If not, then pardon my confusion and go ahead and delete this paragraph.) Just reading and counting channels and orgs and peers, etc, is not good enough for us to be able to run traffic at any connectionprofile network. We should read in and use the actual names throughout PTE code.  ></description> </Issue>

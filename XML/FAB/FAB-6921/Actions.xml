Perhaps the second update got invalidated due to being included in the same block (collision on same key)?

<Action id="35556" issue="23849" author="fenneld7" type="comment" body=" ~denyeart  Hi, I mean it didn&apos;t work both times. When I just invoked and then queried, items&apos; value didn&apos;t change, so I looked into the chaincode container&apos;s log, as showed above. In the log, we can see chaincode did calculated, item A was 99 in the process, but it didn&apos;t put the 99 back into world state successfully. so when I query again, it showed 100, when I invoked again, calculation started from 100, result into 99 again. As no one reported the same bug, it may concern my environment and is rare case." created="2017-11-28 06:15:20.0" updateauthor="fenneld7" updated="2017-11-28 06:15:20.0"/>

CDATA  ~fennelD7  this does seem a local environment issue .. or you could be invoking too soon. There are config settings that influence block creation rate. You might be just running into that.  Please close this if you have solved the issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I fell victim to the illegal character in Channel ID because of my use of an upper case letter in the channel ID as I set about creating a channel.  Someone was kind enough to point me in the direction of the code which stated that only this patternÂ /^ a-z  a-z0-9.- *$/ is permitted for the channel ID.  May I suggest that this information be included in the tutorial docs so as to help everyone - and especially greenhorns to Fabric - avoid making similar mistake I and many others have made when attempting to create a channel ID with a name that doesn't match the desired pattern.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This should still be done as a refactor at some point.  Basically, we should strive not to create go routines that are managed internally within a structure.  Rather, we should spawn the go routine externally, and when it returns (for instance because the node is no longer in the consenter set, or some other error occurs), then we have this context in the thing that spawned it (in this case, the multichannel package).  In this way, the control flow becomes much more clear.  1. Configure consensus plugin 2. Send go routine with launching context in 3. Go routine returns with some error 4. Launching context is free to do whatever maintenance is required (such as restarting it, changing it from active to inactive, etc.).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is infeasible until we have safe concurrently computed config updates.  In particular, because of non-deterministic marshaling in protobuf, only one member can compute the config update which encodes an updated config with the channel.  The problem is thus reduced to ensuring that a new config is computed by someone, and adopted by the channel.  This will likely require help from the specific consensus implementations, as it boils down to a problem of leader election.  After support for safe concurrently computed config updates is added, it should be possible to leverage that, preliminary discussion on this issue is available https://docs.google.com/document/d/14czIS4jrIC9NlgeOQYWbF94rzqmCq4BOR-hS34g3IdM/edit  ></body> </Action>

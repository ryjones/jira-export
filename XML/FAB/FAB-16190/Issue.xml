CDATA We should store Block metadata that is generated on the validating peer in a separate location (say a separate leveldb instance) instead of in the block itself.  This makes reset/rollback much efficient because, this would not need to delete the block files and instead only deleting the relevant metadata would be sufficient.  In a long term, this promises to make block commit process also efficient as the raw blocks can be committed to block files as is as they arrive and processing of blocks can happen asynchronously.  However, this requires one time building of the separate metadata store by parsing the existing metadata in the blockfiles.  ></description> </Issue>

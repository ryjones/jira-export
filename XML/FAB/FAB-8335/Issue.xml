CDATA I think it makes sense to add an API call to the peer, that makes the peer dump its stack trace into the log.   This is useful for highly secure and isolated environments where no one can get into, and only the container logs are visible because they are automatically shipped via some mechanism. In such environments, if there is a problem like a deadlock or something similar, having the stack trace in the log is very useful to troubleshoot.   There are 2 approaches that I see: # Add a new method to the admin gRPC API: ## Pros: The admin gRPC interface was created just for these kind of operations. ## Cons: I don't see a reason of adding this method unless it is authenticated, and the admin API currently does not have authentication.  # Add a new method to CSCC ## Pros: We don't need to extend the admin protos, however there is no real backward compatibility issue because I don't think any client but the peer CLI has implemented this capability anyway. ## Cons: I personally don't think that chaincodes should be used for administrative operations in the peer at all, and it's pretty hard to unit test SCCs but I may be biased.  ></description> </Issue>

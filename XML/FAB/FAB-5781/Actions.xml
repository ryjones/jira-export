At least we need implement the following basic operations, from peer perspective and channel perspective.  For peer: the chaincode (cc) can do: * install * uninstall  For channel: the cc can do: * instantiate (cc bootup and register for serving request) * de-instantiate (cc shutdown/remove and deregister, never serve request again)  The full-lifecycle is very important for product usage. Strongly support to add this as v1.1 highlighted feature.  Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA IMHO, when we do de-instantiate, it should affect all peers inside that channel?  I.e., on specific channel and specific CC, all instantiated containers should be stopped and cleaned up.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jiangyaoguo  I guess when u mentioned stop, u mean just stop a single CC container at specific peer side?

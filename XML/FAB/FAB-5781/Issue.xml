CDATA For now, we have package/install/instantiate/upgrade to manage chaincode's lifecycle. When upgrading chaincode, transactions of different chaincode versions may cause conflicts. Though we have handle conflicts at commiter side, to reduce conflicts, it's better to involve new chaincode " stop" transaction to stop chaincode endorsing service and then "upgrade" this chaincode . After "upgrade" successfully, use new "start" transaction to enable chaicnode endorsing.  The "stop & start" also help operator to disable chaincode temporarily without disable peer. For example, one peer joins two channels, chaincode on one channle produces unexpected results, which need to be fixed. Without "stop/start", we have to notice all peers running that chaincode off-chain to stop peer instance, which will stop other channels the peer joins.

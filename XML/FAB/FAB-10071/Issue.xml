CDATA From the Hyperledger e-mail discussion group there's been discussion about channel name needing to be all lower case. We could not find that documented anywhere.  "Yes, the channel name must be all lower case. More precisely, it must be less than 250 characters long and match the regular expression: " a-z  a-z0-9.- *"  I propose that we update the Helper text on the peer channel create command here  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerchannel.html?highlight=peer%20channel%20create   Â   But I know this text is auto-generated.   ~ChristopherFerris   Would you know who owns the source for this command and how we can get get it updated?  ></description> </Issue>

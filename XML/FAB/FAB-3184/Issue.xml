CDATA Viper allows for setting properties as 'durations', such as 30s for 30 seconds. Most peer and orderer properties are set as durations, but a few are set as integers.  Durations are probably better since the unit makes them unambiguous. This inconsistency should be fixed prior to 1.0 release. Here are a few examples from core.yaml that should should be fixed:  timeout: 10 startuptimeout: 300000 executetimeout: 30000 deploytimeout: 30000  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA due to internal addresses being computed as non-loopback address, therefore we have 2 problems:  * The integration test core template sets the bind address to be the loopback only, hence the packets don't arrive when peers use non loopback addresses * The SAN that the integration tests generate only use loopback so even if the TCP packets arrive, the TLS handshake will still fail.  We need to consider not setting the autoDetect in the core template to make the peer only use loopback.   ></description> </Issue>

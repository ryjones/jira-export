CDATA Hi,  I tried to reproduce your problem but couldn't. I wonder what you had done before.  I followed the three examples that are now in the README.  I did have some problems but not the same as yours.  On getting the order started for the reconfiguration example, starting the orderer failed because it didn't have the permission to create /var/hyperledger. Then to get the adding organization example going I had to delete the /var/hyperledger/* But that's all. It would help if you could give a bit more info.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

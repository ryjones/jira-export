CDATA Presently, the core/scc/ package declares all of the system chaincodes which exist, and their attributes, and is used by the chaincode package to determine which chaincodes are system chaincodes and to apply special checks to these chaincodes.  There is no compelling reason why system chaincodes should be treated differently than user chaincode, especially why that treatment should spill into other sections of the code.  Ultimately, system chaincodes should be managed by the same lifecycle as user ones.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I'm not able to perform query command on my sample chaincode example, chaincode_example02.  I'm able to perform deploy and invoke commands after starting the docker images. But error pops up in query command.  I'm not using development mode for the peer images. I get the following response after the error:  "Error when querying chaincode: Error:Failed to launch chaincode spec(Could not get deployment transaction for mycc - LedgerError - ResourceNotFound: ledger: resource not found)"  Also, I got some error of "FSM Handler" and "RANGE_QUERY_STATE" on the console log while executing the command.  I ran the blockchain on debug mode, so have seen all the logs and there was no error in deploying or invoking the chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

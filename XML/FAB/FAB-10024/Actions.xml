CDATA Hi.   As  ~mastersingh24  mentioned I used govendor to solve the problem. This utility places all my go dependencies in a folder named vendor. Then I placed my chaincode along with the vendor folder in the directory my app expected. In my case because I was working with balance transfer example I placed them under ( balance-transfer/artifacts/src/github.com/ ). Go searches vendor folder whenever it depends on an external library.   This is How I imported the libraries I needed in my chaincode:     import (  "bytes"  "encoding/json"  "errors"  "fmt"  "strconv"  "time"  "github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes"  "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid" "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim" "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer"  )  Also these links provide useful information about govendor.   https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/vendor-folder/    https://github.com/kardianos/govendor         ></body> </Action>

CDATA I remember copying the whole Fabric 1.1 repo into my GOPATH and then running the govendor commad from there. I guess you should run govendor from your GOPATH to be able to import libraries that are in your GOPATH.   I Copied the below Q/A form Govendor FAQ ( https://github.com/kardianos/govendor/blob/master/doc/faq.md ). h4. Q: I have a working program with dependencies in $GOPATH. I want to vendor now.  A: Run {{govendor add +external}}.  ></body> </Action>

There are a couple of places where this probably doesn&apos;t make that much sense, notably around the x509 certificates and other MSP related types since these types would need to be passed by reference anyways when using the crypto library. Let&apos;s revisit and get it right this time." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2020-03-13 14:39:26.0" updated="2020-03-24 12:01:07.0" resolutiondate="2020-03-23 13:30:14.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="58483" archived="N"/>

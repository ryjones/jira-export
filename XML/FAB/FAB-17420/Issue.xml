This story is to remove those startup checks to allow the orderer to start successfully, even though it will not be in a position to accomplish anything.  This should also block channel creation requests if no system channel is defined to route them to." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2020-01-21 16:03:24.0" updated="2020-02-13 22:44:58.0" resolutiondate="2020-02-07 17:25:25.0" votes="0" watches="7" workflowId="57912"/>

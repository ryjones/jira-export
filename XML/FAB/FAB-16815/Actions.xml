CDATA an attempt was made here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/33896  per  ~jyellick  's comment: {quote} I imagine we could get this tested to see if it fixes the problem, the tricky part as always is getting an image built with the fix in it for test.  My bigger concern is more about regressions.  What (if any) impact will this have on performance? Are there any other possible negative side effects? The fact that Sarama does not default to flipping this bit on makes me wonder why.  I think my inclination would be to hold this in our back pocket in case the issue is reported and a problem in the field.  But, as our emphasis on testing is away from Kafka now, just changing it without investing in regression worries me. {quote}  leave this in backlog for now, and reopen when the issue resurfaces  ></body> </Action>

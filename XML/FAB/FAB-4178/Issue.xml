CDATA see discussion in RC here  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ci-pipeline?msg=p7yYajRZsYJ6Phjve   I would think that if the experiment were successful, we might look to implement post 1.0.0 release.  Would like to see a test repo established in Gerrit that we can test out the flow, etc and then demonstrate to the community.  CR push invokes smoke or partial UT plus selected additional tests, sufficient to warrant code review. 2 +2 triggers full CI pass that would then trigger merge on success or return to unverified state.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Dear Ramesh,   I am attaching a snippet I wrote that will use bash + REST API to get the following information: * Browse for all the rebased (mergeable) opened gerrits in a particular project (in my example, fabric) * Extract their Change ID's and use that Change ID to see if it has 2 or more +2 Code Reviews given * Give you the Change ID's of the commit's ready for 2nd verification  Please use this information to trigger your 2nd job that will run the full CI pass.   Back in my previous company, we had this 1st job running on a cronjob every hour looking for changes ready for full CI pass verification. We can do something similar here too  If you need these Change-Ids translated back to gerrit numbers or something else let me know. I will see what I can do.         ></body> </Action>

Once the CI patch is merged, every patch set submitted event triggers two-way staged job and look for +2 if there is no +2, it triggers make verify otherwise it executes make unit-tests and run full CI on the patchset.  ~tongliofcary  Is this the correct approach?

CDATA Join application channel with join-block as member.  Define a 3 node raft cluster without a system channel. Start only 2 of these nodes. Submit a few transactions for the  ledger height to be >>1. Submit a config TX (change something other than consensus related stuff) so that the last config will be number > 0.  Start the 3rd node w/o channels. Get the last config block  from one of the 2 active cluster nodes and join the channel on the 3rd node.  Check that the 3rd node pulls all the blocks.  Check the cluster-relation (=member) and status for the transition (onboarding->active).  Submit some transactions to the 3rd node to verify it mutated into an etcdraft.Chain.  ></description> </Issue>

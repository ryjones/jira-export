CDATA  {noformat} As a result, behave tests (bddtest) seems to fail when GOROOT is not set during instantiating a chaincode because the vendored packages lack “shim” : {noformat}  We actually don't want to vendor the shim package but the problem with or the protos/peer packages.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~shimos  since FAB-2493 we include only external dependencies that are not in fabric runtime (ccenv, host etc). In particular shim and protos are excluded from the package.  So I don't understand the statements (but perhaps I'm missing something ?)  _*many fabric packages are also vendored, resulting in a big deployment package.*_  *_the purpose of the CR is to make vendoring code not include shim (or other fabric packages)_*     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~muralisr  Maybe I think I did not explain well....  As you said, by FAB-2493, the fabric runtime is supposed to be excluded. But _if GOROOT is not set_, some fabric runtime is actually included due to the bugs I reported in this issue. The CR is to fix this, making this feature work even if GOROOT is not set. (it is usual not to set GOROOT when you install Go in the standard location)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA # Refer to FAB-11614-2iSBE (50% using SBE keys) and FAB-11615 and FAB-11615-2iSBE (100% using keys) as examples of functioning tests. # In the transactions used in this test, set the endorsement policy to require (and send TX to) 2 or more endorsers. # We could add this SBE traffic to all 3 networks in the system test suite.  Plan: Optionally use pte_driver for install/instantiate as well as transactions. No need to modify gen_cfgInputs.sh. Or could solve FAB-15902 first and then use gen_cfgInputs.sh to send transactions. Be sure point 2 is satisfied by the test; modify the steps if necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

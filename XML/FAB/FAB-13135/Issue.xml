CDATA Currently the Sign function in bccsp/idemix/bridge/credrequest.go generates a nonce which it passes into NewCredRequest. But, from the Fabric CA server perspective the CA server generates a nonce which gets return to the client. The client then includes this nonce in the credential request, which on the CA server side is extracted and checked to make sure its valid to prevent replay attacks.  For this reason, need the ability to pass in nonce rather than have the Sign function generate it.  ></description> </Issue>

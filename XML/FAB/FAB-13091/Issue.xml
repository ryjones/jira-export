CDATA This is to avoid snapshot sending cycles, per  comments|https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/dedae6eb7c253635e70403a1fb04842700277b23/etcdserver/server.go#L2173-L2177  in etcd:  {quote} When sending a snapshot, etcd will pause compaction. After receives a snapshot, the slow follower needs to get all the entries right after the snapshot sent to catch up. If we do not pause compaction, the log entries right after the snapshot sent might already be compacted. It happens when the snapshot takes long time to send and save. Pausing compaction avoids triggering a snapshot sending cycle. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

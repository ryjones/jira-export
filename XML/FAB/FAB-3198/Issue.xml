CDATA The gossip comm layer exposes a subscription-like API and returns a dedicated channel to the caller.  Since it is convenient to iterate over a channel until it's closed, or to understand that a channel has been closed when nil is returned from select - it was implemented that at the comm layer shutdown - the subscriptions channels are closed.  This might have caused a "send to closed channel" error- and so- the implementation has a defer statement with recover() that recovers from that.  It also logs a WARN message un-necessarily because that's not something that shouldn't have happened.  So, unless anyone objects(  ~C0rWin  /  ~gennadyl  ) I'm removing this WARN logging message.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Current BDD test framework does not start up docker images with exposed ports. Instead, it relies on the fact that, on Linux, the docker daemon creates a bridge network for each new docker network and that network is then reachable from the host. e.g: {code} vagrant@hyperledger-devenv $ docker network ls NETWORK ID          NAME                                       DRIVER              SCOPE 0b27fbe815f1        2a53e202bd5211e6891408002790a540_default   bridge              local                08b4d7b23046        bridge                                     bridge              local                fc18e2f3079a        host                                       host                local                faa1279a798d        none                                       null                local                 vagrant@hyperledger-devenv $ ifconfig br-0b27fbe815f1 br-0b27fbe815f1 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:51:7b:11:90   inet addr:172.20.0.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0  {code}  On macOS these bridge networks are created, but they are hidden and not routable from the host.  As part of this item I will do the following: # Have the docker-compose.yml files map the exposed ports to the local host. # The ports will be mapped to a random local port so that: ## Multiple docker containers can expose the same port at the same time. ## The ports will not conflict with the Vagrant forwarded ports. # The BDD tests framework will be updated to use the mapped host and port for the exposed ports.   ></body> </Action>

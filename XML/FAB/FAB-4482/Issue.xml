CDATA In order to fully take advantage of the regular expression capabilities of the peer logging commands, I propose that we use this task (creating sub-tasks as needed) to handle updating logging modules names, where applicable, to consistently follow the format:  <component>.<subcomponent>  For example, the peer CLI commands could be updated from logging module names such as "channelCmd" and "chaincodeCmd" to "cli.channel" and "cli.chaincode" in order to facilitate updating all CLI-related loggers at once, e.g. "peer logging setlevel cli DEBUG".  Another component that could clearly benefit from this is the ledger, which has a large number of module names that could be unified under the format "ledger.<subcomponent>".   The gossip component already does this and is a great example to follow as well.   ></description> </Issue>

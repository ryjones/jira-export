CDATA This commit adds 2 datastructures used by the gossip forwarding mechanism: * messageStore: A storage cache for disseminated data items It is used to decide whether a message is "fresh", and needs to be forwarded to other peers, or maybe if its too "old" and it needs to be discarded. This cache is also in use by the pull mechanism the gossip code that'll be pushed later on will connect between them because it provides the data source for answering pull requests from other peers.  * forwardingBatcher: A batch and time based component that causes the gossip to forward messages When a timer expires or if too many messages are outstanding.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1257/ ae7fc24473c7278afa1e0eddecaf323227ea8de3  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This was originally touched on the FAB-12729 discussion.   ~yacovm : {quote}Another question we need to ask ourselves is - what if we have an OSN that is in the system channel and was added to a new channel at a later point: It won't know the addition of itself through the system channel, because the transaction would point to the application channel. I think that ideally we'd want an administrative API that would trigger the onboarding code from FAB-12555 that will sync it to a point where its certificate is in the consenter set, and afterwards would start the chain. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

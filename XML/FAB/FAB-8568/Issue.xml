CDATA As of 1.1 alpha timeframe, 3rd party images do not follow the same docker IMAGE_TAG versioning as the other Fabric docker images.  Need to remove IMAGE_TAG from couchdb images, and default to latest couchdb image, which is how it worked prior to the -i introduction.  This change needs to be made in master branch but not release branch, since the IMAGE_TAGs are aligned in 1.0.x release.  ></description> </Issue>

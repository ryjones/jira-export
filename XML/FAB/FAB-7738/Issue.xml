CDATA PTE calculates TPS based on the intervals specified by the user.Â  The interval can be by transaction index intervalor run time interval.  For example, the interval from transaction 300 to 700 in the case that nRequest = 1000.  For example the interval from 2nd min to 7th min in the case that runDur = 10 min.  This feature allows the TPS to avoid initial and ending periods which the transactions are less busy.  ></description> </Issue>

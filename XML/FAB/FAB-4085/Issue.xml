CDATA *TLDR:* This JIRA issue deals with purging of identities from memory if they are not used for a certain amount of time  the fix just makes sure you don't purge your own identity  without this gossip may run into really bad situations   *The longer version:* In gossip we have time-based expiration of identities that haven't been used for a long time. This may cause an expiration of the peer's own certificate if it doesn't gossip with any peers because it's alone in the world.  The problem is that when an identity expires from the identity store, it is also expired from the pull mediator that is used for identities. The only way to add your own identity to the pull mediator is at startup, therefore - we can reach a situation in which all identities are removed from the pull mediator, and then the identity replication would only work via handshakes which isn't good.      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Configure the peer and orderer to use prometheus for metrics. Set up an instance of prometheus with the appropriate service scrape configuration to collect metrics from the peers and orderers. - Run a workload. - Verify that the metrics make sense for the workload and that the metrics have appropriate names, labels, and help text.  Test Setup: 2 Org, 4 peer Docker network, with graphite-statsD container, Marbles02 chaincode with 500 transactions.  Tests Pass if Graphite shows metrics from all peers and all orderers. A list of observed metrics and sample graphs to be added.  ></description> </Issue>

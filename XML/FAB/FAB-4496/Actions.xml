CDATA so I think that if we cache this naively in the MSP we would run into a different problem, since the MSP manager is per channel, and then the cache size would be linear to the number of channels the peer / orderer is a member of - not a good idea.  Therefore perhaps we create an LRU-based cache that is shared among the MSP instances, and the keys would be the hash of the serilizedIdentity and the values would be a map from MSP-ID to msp.Identity ?   ></body> </Action>

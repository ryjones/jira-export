CDATA Certificate sanitization solves the issue of double representation of an ECDSA signature in the context of an x509 certificate. Unfortunately, it also introduces a bottleneck because in order to sanitise a certificate, its parent needs to be loaded. This might take time.  A possible solution would be that of caching the relevant information to perform sanitization per MSP and per peer.      ~elli-androulaki , ~ales , ~mastersingh24 , ~yacovm , ~binhn , ~muralisr , ~C0rWin , ~jyellick  what's your take on this?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA FAB-6227 processes resource changes and updates resource bundle atomically. In order to do this, it has to set the resource information in ledger state which is currently being done in RSCC.  This tasks removes the duplication in RSCC and changes RSCC to directly use the resource bundle.  The side-effect of FAB-6227 is to process updates as well at one stroke (this was a TODO in the FAB-3621 work)  ></description> </Issue>

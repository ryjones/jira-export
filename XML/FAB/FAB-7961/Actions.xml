CDATA Please post complete orderer logs at debug level.  Considering that this is the same config update validation code that was present in v1.0, I suspect that this is not actually a bug.  If at all possible, please also include the config update transactions as well.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I do not believe that your testing tool is appropriately capturing the failure case.

Maybe you could even run the test and stop after that point, and send in the command again from CLI to see the response directly output to you. Based on the logs Jason pointed out, it looks like we will need to enhance the implementation steps for jeff&apos;s upgrade.feature file." created="2018-02-21 00:03:44.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-02-21 00:03:44.0"/>

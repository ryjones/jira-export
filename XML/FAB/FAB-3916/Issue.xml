CDATA Currently in gossip we have ingress and egress buffers per peer connection. If the egress buffer is full and a send of a message is invoked, the message is discarded.  This heuristic is too course, and needs to consider also the total size of messages in the buffer, since the rate in which the buffer is emptied is correlated with the size of messages in the buffer   ~C0rWin   ~gennadyl   ></description> </Issue>

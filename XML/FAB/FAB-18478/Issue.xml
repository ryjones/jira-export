CDATA Hi,     Currently our production application is running on 1.2 version and all my orderer and peer admin certificates got expired.   After I have created new certificates and replaced in the same directory of old certificates. My application is working fine and I was able to do the transactions.     But when I tried to add new org or update channel configurations, it is giving expired error when I tried to sign with old admin certs.   I was unable to use *ORDERER_GENERAL_AUTHENTICATION_NOEXPIRATIONCHECKS*=true and  *--tlsHandshakeTimeShift* options in 1.2 version as these options available after 1.4.3 version     *Is there any way to restore my network and update the new certificates in 1.2 version?*   Once the network is restored then only we can upgrade to 1.3 or 1.4 versions.     Regards,  Ramesh.     ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="42607" issue="29067" author="christopherferris" type="comment" body="This is working as expected. We did not want to have to force devs to fix other people&apos;s problems. Instead, we only check for committed (in CI) and uncommitted changes (local). If a file is changed and it has the old style license, we ask them to fix it.

Maybe we should document this." created="2018-04-05 20:41:09.0" updateauthor="christopherferris" updated="2018-04-05 20:41:09.0"/>

CDATA I have setup fabric-network with 1.4.2 just 2 days back. Network has 2 orgs with 3 peers in each org, 3 zookeepers, 4 kafka brokers and 4 orderers. we created 4 channels out of which 3 are dedicated channels(org1-1 channel, org2- 2 channels) and one joint channel between org1 and org2. Everything worked fine till today morning. All of a sudden, when we pushed transactions to 2 dedicated channels one from each org, we found that transaction didn't get stored in org1 and org2 peers ledger while all other channels are still working fine. I am not able to reproduce this issue. When i checked one of the orderer node logs, I found below logs for one of the dedicated channel  {code} 2019-08-21 09:17:28.019 UTC  orderer.consensus.kafka  processTimeToCut -> DEBU 989  channel: fatico-dedicated  It's a time-to-cut message for block  15  2019-08-21 09:17:28.019 UTC  orderer.consensus.kafka  processTimeToCut -> DEBU 98a  channel: fatico-dedicated  Ignoring stale time-to-cut-message for block  15  2019-08-21 09:17:28.019 UTC  orderer.consensus.kafka  processMessagesToBlocks -> DEBU 98b  channel: fatico-dedicated  Successfully unmarshalled consumed message, offset is 64.

CDATA The test case "when an orderer node is evicted, it does not complain and does it obediently" finds a leader, and then creates a channel, and then removes the leader from both channels.     However, obviously - that is only the system channel leader, and it may not be the leader of the application channel.     When it's not the leader - the other nodes might cease communication with that evicted node (in case it's slow) - and then the test fails because it doesn't detect its own eviction.        ></description> </Issue>

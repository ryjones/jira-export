CDATA Functional and behavior driven tests should be written based on the understanding of a fabric requirement (story) and not on the implementation of the requirement. This story will add this capability. These tests can then be executed to verify that the implementation was completed as expected.  When writing the underlying code behind the feature files, certain details of implementation should be understood and used, but this should not stop the initial setup of the tests.  This story should allow for the basic setup of functional and behavior tests for the fabric project.  ></description> </Issue>

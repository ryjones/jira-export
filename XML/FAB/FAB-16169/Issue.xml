This leads to confusing and bloated code and performance penalty. We should have a single point in the code where transactions are parsed, and it should be possible to perform this step in parallel. The rest of the validatior/committer component should be able to reuse the results of this step" priority="3" status="10708" created="2019-08-01 17:07:12.0" updated="2019-11-20 18:44:23.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="54635"/>

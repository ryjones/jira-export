CDATA The peer can detect if the orderer drops the connection and will move to a new orderer in this case.  However, what the peer won't detect is if the orderer is running, but not responding to requests.    The peer should include logic such that after some number of errors or if it's not getting responses, it should move to another orderer and retry.     The peer should also log something if it detects a failed orderer.      ~C0rWin  FYI  ></description> </Issue>

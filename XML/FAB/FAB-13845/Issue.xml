CDATA increase tick interval to 200ms  it shouldn't be 500ms, because that would result in a random ElectionTimeout between 5s ~ 10s, so we have leaderless period of 5s. However, our {{peer channel create}} timeout is 5s by default. (it submits config update to orderer, and try to fetch genesis block of channel, which invokes {{Deliver}} API, that returns error when leaderless)  ></description> </Issue>

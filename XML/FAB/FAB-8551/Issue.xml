CDATA The build process for {{configtxgen}} {{configtxlator}} and {{cryptogen}} all produce local binaries with sane output for the Version like: {{1.1.0-beta-snapshot-b0f284a58}}  However, inside of the fabric-tools docker image, even from the same build, these binaries output the unhelpful {{development build}} as the Version.  Note, this does not appear to affect the {{peer}} or {{orderer}} binaries which likewise output a sane version from within the image.  Marking as a fix version of v1.1 in case this is an easy fix.  Otherwise, it is probably fine for deferral.  ></description> </Issue>

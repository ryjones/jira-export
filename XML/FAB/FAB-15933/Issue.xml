CDATA Currently, once NodeOU classification is enabled, it is enforced that client, admin, peer, and orderer classification are properly specified. Though, not all organisations are required to have support for all classifications.  Therefore, even when NodeOU classification is enabled, specific classifications can be omitted.  The expected behaviour should be the following: 1. if a classification is not provided then the setup should not fail. 2. if a classification is not provided testing an identity against that classification will fail. 3. if  NodeOU classification is enabled but no valid classification is provided, then NodeOU classification is disabled.  ></description> </Issue>

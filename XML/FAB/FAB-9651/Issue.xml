CDATA When the receive channel has been closed, with the current implementation, all calls to receive after the close will return the zero value of the channel (a nil message) and no error. This makes debugging closed channels more difficult than necessary.  The receive implementations should change to use the two-arg version of receive and return an error indicating a closed channel if the channel has closed.  ></description> </Issue>

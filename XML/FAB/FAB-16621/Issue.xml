CDATA Link flags are used to set the values of some variables at build time. These typically include version information and the commit hash.  Most of these exist in common.Metadata: {code} // Variables defined by the Makefile and passed in with ldflags                                                                                                                  var Version string = "latest"                                                                                                                                                    var CommitSHA string = "development build"                                                                                                                                       var BaseDockerLabel string = "org.hyperledger.fabric"                                                                                                                            var DockerNamespace string = "hyperledger"                                                                                                                                       var BaseDockerNamespace string = "hyperledger"  {code}  while others live in the package that hosts the tool main. Well, as the commands got moved around, the link flags were not updated...  All of the link flags used in the build need to be revisited. Where tool specific versions are needed, the variable names should declared in the main package.  ></description> </Issue>

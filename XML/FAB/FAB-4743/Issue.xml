CDATA The delivery client has a backoff policy that specifies an amount of time to sleep and whether to continue to retry based on an attempt number.     Currently the code that calculates the amount of time to sleep is prone to overflow to a negative number.  However, the fact that the code only retries a limited number of times (not indefinitely) saves us from the overflow.     I would like to make the code that calculates the time duration to sleep to never overflow in order for if someone in the future to change the attempt threshold and forget about the overflow problem lurking around the corner, we won't have a problem.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This was found by a pen test on Fabric 1.0.6. I have updated the affected version. As I understand  go-crypto/tls 1.7|https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.7/src/crypto/tls/common.go#L35  was used in fabric-1.0.x and hence the minimum version supported by server is TLS1.0. The following CBC padding attack is limited to SSL3.0 and this would never occur on TLS1.0 even though server advertises it for support.   ~yacovm  can you confirm and mark the JIRA as duplicate  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are CBC cipher in TLS 1.x also. I looked at the fabric code and found that CBC cipher is not supported.  ~rhegde  Can you rerun test on Fabric 1.2  and let us know the result ?

You have to make sure that you are hitting Fabric TLS end point directly.

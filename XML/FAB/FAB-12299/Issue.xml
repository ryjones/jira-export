CDATA fabric-samples version v1.1.0 - balance-transfer sample - does not work with custom crypto or custom network - missing steps/instructions?  A) Defined custom network with docker-compose B) Defined custom consortium with configtx.yaml & crypto-config.yaml C) Generated cryptogen and channel artifacts with config indicated in step B D) Adjusted rest of sample definitions of balance-transfer to use A), B) and C) E) Brought up network and started the application - runApp.sh. Network comes up and webserver starts with app deployed F) Registering and enrollment of user fails - due to absence of fabric-ca-client-kv* artifacts in root folder and also in backing storage /tmp  G) Sample works fine - even after deleting those fabric-ca-client-kv* artifacts and re-running sample. However customized use case does not work this way.  F) What is missing? and what needs to be done to have the fabric-ca-client-kv* artifacts created first time and other times afterwards.  H) We need steps to perform to get custom use case working and also document the steps in the sample document.   I) This could be an issue across multiple versions. Please perform these steps to replicate the problem to see for yourself. Thanks.  ></description> </Issue>

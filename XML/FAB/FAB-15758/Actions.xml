CDATA Not sure what you are looking for here?  The peer and orderer binaries log to stderr not to files; so not sure how we can do any type of log rotation. And if you are using the Docker images, Docker has built-in log rotation settings.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="61808" issue="40683" author="shiyuan" type="comment" body="We are developing a BaaS (blockchain as a serivce) platform. According to the requirements from some of our customers, the peer and orderer nodes are not running in docker containers but in virtual machines or bare machines directly. We can redirect log from stderr to log files but can not rotate the log files. The lograte tool can neither work with the log files. " created="2019-07-15 08:20:09.0" updateauthor="shiyuan" updated="2019-07-15 08:21:30.0"/>

CDATA In the current Behave feature files (`fabric-test` repo) the term *deploy* stands for a combination of two steps: 1) creating a channel, and joining the channel by the peer, 3) install and instantiate the chaincode  This contradicts with the usage of  the term *deploy* in Fabric, where it means install and instantiate a chaincode only.  The *deploy* in behave should be broken down in two parts mentioned above.   ></description> </Issue>

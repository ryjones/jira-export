As the primary purpose this serves is to allow a transaction simulation, which is a linear execution by nature. Any special cases such as chaincode timeouts are best handled by an external synchronization. Just for this special case making `done` only synchronized would cause confusion in the ledger code.  ~sykesm  - is it difficult synchronizing between the chaincode call and the timeout handler call?" created="2018-12-01 02:43:05.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2018-12-01 02:43:05.0"/>

CDATA > is it difficult synchronizing between the chaincode call and the timeout handler call? Yes. Saying that something can only be accessed from one go routine necessarily means you can't asynchronously cancel it.  I'm closing this issue for now as I will be taking no action and it's apparently not causing any pain.  ></body> </Action>

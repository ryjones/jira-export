CDATA There are two aspects to the security of the new deployment model (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1783) * securing the package * securing the instantiation of the package * linking the secured package with the instantiation  +Securing the package+ The structure of the package would be  * Envelope ** serialized deploymentSpec ** creator bytes ** policy for chaincode instantiation ** hash of the above ** signature over the above  +Securing the instantiation of the package+ Instantiation is a Proposal to LCCC (life cycle system chaincode) that will go through the usual Peer validation checks.  * who is the creator of the proposal ? Local MSP Admin  * who can access this chaincode ? Invoke and instantiate ?  On successful validation, an entry will be created in the LCCC on the channel's ledger * name of the cc * version of the cc * hash from the package  * signature from the package  +Linking the secured package with the instantiation+ The static links between the LCCC entry (described above) and contents of the package provide means to cross check and verify the chaincode.  The LCCC entry will be checked against the chaincode every time the chaincode is launched * on instantiation * on bring up the chaincode for an invoke if not already running  ></description> </Issue>

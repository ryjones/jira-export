CDATA 1) In some deployments, it is expected that the client-facing TLS certificates would be obtained from a public CA such as let's encrypt, and they would be rotated on a frequent basis (i.e-  once every 3 months).  2) Cluster type ordering service nodes use TLS pinning to authenticate one another, on a channel basis.   It follows from 1+2 that the channel administrators of an ordering service would need to do a config update for every TLS cert rotation of any cluster node, once every certificate lifetime for every channel.  This onus can be lifted by just using different TLS certificates for intra-cluster communication, such as those that are issued by organizational CAs, and would have longer expiration periods.   This is still safe, because if the private keys of these certificates are compromised, they can be easily "revoked" via doing a config update for all channels.     ></description> </Issue>

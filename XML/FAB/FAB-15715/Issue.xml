CDATA h2. Fix and clean up documents for instructions to use dev-mode  h3. Fix instructions  We need to fix the instruction for the dev-mode described in {{fabric/docs/source/chaincode4ade.rst}}.   Currently, The instructions say to execute the following command to start the chaincode.  {code:bash} CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer:7052 CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 ./sacc {code}  However, this command fails with the following error messages.  {code} Error starting SimpleAsset chaincode: flag 'peer.address' must be set {code}  To fix this problem, the command should be set the flag {{peer.address}}. However, this command fails with the following error messages.  {code} Error starting SimpleAsset chaincode: error trying to connect to local peer: 'CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED' must be set to 'true' or 'false' {code}   To fix this problem, the command should be set {{CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false}} as follows.  {code:bash} CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer:7052 CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false ./sacc -peer.address peer:7052 {code}  The above command works normally.   We also need to modify the instruction to build and start chaincode to use {{/bin/sh}} instead of {{/bin/bash}}. This is because {{bash}} is not installed on {{ccenv}} container because {{libtool}} that depends on bash is removed from {{ccenv}} by FAB-15670 updates.   h3. Clean up instructions  We can find another document for instructions to use dev-mode in {{fabric/docs/source/peer-chaincode-devmode.rst}}.    However, it seems that this page should be removed as the following reasons.  - It seems a dead page as it has no links from the other documents. - The contents duplicate {{fabric/docs/source/chaincode4ade.rst}} - It is not enough maintained (e.g., need to fix as the same above).   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The daily-pte tests are failing consistently in multiple test cases. The pte-daily that usually takes four hours to complete is waiting for 14 hours and timing out before all the pte test cases are executed. There have been no changes in fabric-test that could have affected the daily test. There are no log files generated for these test fails.

CDATA I have split our chaincode samples into an iot contract platform -- consisting of a fair amount of code to model asset classes and efficiently support state history, recent states, filters on read all, delete all and read history, and so on -- and a contract sample, which is pretty small for what it can do.  It all works swimmingly in the dev environment, and it works to perform go get of the platform and then go install of the contract.  But when I deploy to Bluemix using v0.6, it fails because the peer uses "gi install" instead of "go get", which means that only packages already on the peer can participate. This forces us to vendor everything we use, which is a bit of a barrier to development at this early stage.  Would it be possible to get the script that builds chaincode -- see step 4 in the included text below -- to call go get for now instead? The Go docs are rather ambiguous, but stackexchange seems to say that go get is go install++ in that it will not download what already exists, but will find what does not exist on the server.  NOTE: This can be a temporary stop gap until we have a chaincode build / deploy solution that avoids the vendoring hassle.

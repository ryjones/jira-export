CDATA For Channels:  I am not sure pointing to the design documentation is wise. Some of these documents are out of date.  Also, i think it would be helpful to have an example. People struggle uwithout an example. Show them a picture (which seems to work with people).  Bank A Bank B Bank C channel 1 yes yes no channel 2 no yes yes channel 3 yes no yes channel 4 yes yes yes  yes means they are on cahnnel no means they are not on channel  In this example, we need to explain that Bank A and Bank B can be endorsers as well as comitters for channel 1. Bank C can not see the # of transactions... and they can't see the data on the ledger  The reason why I included channel 4 is included is some people think you can't have all participants in a channel- which you can.  ></body> </Action>

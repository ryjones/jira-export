CDATA BYFN and Fabcar with couchdb are failing intermittently because CLI sends a request for joining a Channel before a Peer connects to the couchdb. FAB-15464 pointed out that the couchdb container takes too long to startup after moving to the official couchdb image. CI jobs for fabric-samples are failing due to the same reason. To run BYFN and Fabcar successfully, we need a workaround to change the value of MAX_RETRY to wait the couchdb.  ></description> </Issue>

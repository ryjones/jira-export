Can you add some sentences on what the differences from that model are please ? As I see it the difference is not in the model itself but in the supporting tooling (which we did not have before)." created="2018-03-22 17:45:22.0" updateauthor="muralisr" updated="2018-03-22 17:47:16.0"/>

CDATA Thanks  ~jyellick , just wanted to make sure to understand the proposal correctly.  As an aside, true, a lot of the churn in FAB-3621 was just trying to understand the problem (what the ACLs actually were, how they were currently used, the realization of the tie-ins with ChannelReaders and ChannelWriters)...it took all that discussion (which you know of intimately :))  to get to settle down to Name to Policy mapping scheme.     ></body> </Action>

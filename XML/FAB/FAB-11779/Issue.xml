CDATA After running a stress test for several hours, the system performance rapidly degrades. We observe hight increase in IO and the whole network slowing down significantly. CPU is at the maximum during the whole test, and goes down significantly when the high IO starts happening.  The issue is very similar to  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17020.    Perhaps the issue can be fixed by moving goleveldb to revision c4c61651e9e37fa117f53c5a906d3b63090d8445, which has this fix:  https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/pull/227 .  ></description> </Issue>

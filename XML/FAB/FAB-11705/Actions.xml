CDATA https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25820/  I see there is a change set by  ~ales  and  ~mne  that removes the function.  But we still have a problem if the channel runs in v1.2 mode and lower.   So I recommend the change to be merged as soon as possible so that a v1.3 binary would act like a v1.2 and lower binary, with respect to channels at levels lower than 1.3  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~bmos299  - I think it could be very helpful if this case will be tested in system tests.  The 2 ingredients to reproduce this are: * A chaincode that writes a few KB of data, I think over 10K is sufficient for sure * An endorsement policy of AND of 2 orgs.  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA By default, invokes should use the event listener in order to know when a transaction is written to the ledger. This will help to speed up the tests as well as ensure that transactions are written when expected.   An additional step is needed to outline the test case when one does *not* want to wait for the transaction to be written to the ledger. For example,  {code} When a user, not waiting, invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args  "invoke","a","b","10" " {code}  Use of a flag to state when one should wait when performing invokes is recommended.  ></description> </Issue>

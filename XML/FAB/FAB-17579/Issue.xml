CDATA To ensure that the config transactions generate functional code in the context of a running network, create an integration test suite that uses the config package instead of configtxgen and the peer cli to create channel configuration transactions.  The tests can still rely on cryptogen to create MSP material.  While the nwo package may create a configtx yaml configuration and call the tool, the actual tests should not use those artifacts. If minor changes are needed to bootstrap (provided they are backward compatible and not a complete bifurcation of logic or dual pathing), they can be included in this effort.  ></description> </Issue>

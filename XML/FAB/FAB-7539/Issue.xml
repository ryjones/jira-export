CDATA This doc needs review by a doc person for style and grammar. One comment is that it appears to have been written as a "What's New" guide as several of the headings are titled "New API" etc.  What is new for v1.1 will no longer be new in v1.2, so it seems better to not write in this way.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Something like that should be done in a separate issue. The fact that there's a "gotools-clean" target that's not part of "clean" has bitten me as well.  IMO, the whole build process needs a good rethink.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Not for nothing, but, you're not alone. I started with the code base in December and ended up doing a "new contributor experience" presentation to maintainers to highlight some of the areas that need improvement.

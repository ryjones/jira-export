CDATA As mentioned in spreadsheet, we could consider running these as part of the system test suite, instead of IT. That would use a k8s cluster for 3 network configs, and use pte and the nodesdk for all the component configurations (and of course various message sizes).  However, that would NOT cover javasdk or cli interfaces. And the systemtest suites are NOT hooked into the CI pipelines as an interop test (ie. before images are published).  We should consider doing that anyways for good coverage, and still do something with large msg sizes in the javasdk IT test suite to cover that - and even include that in an interop job so we have at least one test with a large message that tests fabric before images are published.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The systest suite now includes the processing of huge messages in different network configurations, per FAB-16524 and FAB-16641. That does not use idemix.  I view the remaining interop workitems as having 2 parts.Â  (1) identify or add tests to the SDKs Integration tests to cover the test scenarios, and (2) spin off another task to include these tests in the new interop test job in the new CI pipeline when it is established at some future date.  ></body> </Action>

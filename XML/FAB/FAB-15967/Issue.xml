CDATA Create an interop test suite to replace the behave interop tests; refer to Item 32 of tab "Behave Testcases" of  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741 . {quote}fabric-ca.feature: Scenario Outline: FAB-6489: Interoperability Test using <type> based orderer with a <database> db using <interface> with <language> chaincode {quote} We should be able to replace these behave interop tagged tests by rerunning selected existing node-sdk and java-sdk IT tests - with the Interop job pulling latest images from each repo (instead of building anything). * The fabric integration tests cover dbtypes and orderertypes. * The node-sdk and java-sdk integration tests use fabric and all 3 chaincode Languages and enroll users with CA. The release/system tests also test peers and orderers in various configurations (dbtypes, orderertypes, with/without (mutual) tls, etc).  NOTE: This should be done using IDEMIX too (at least with java-sdk where it is supported), to cover in interop scenarios the behave testcase FAB-11728 (Item 34, FAB-16022).  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="25944" issue="15060" author="greg.haskins" type="comment" body=" ~guoger  the fundamental problem is that the peer container was intended to only serve as a minimal container for running a peer node.  As such, it was intentionally packed into baseos, which is intentionally as minimal as possible.  Unfortunately, people started to (ab)use the peer container as a CLI too. I am of the opinion that docker is great in general, but not as a vehicle for CLI.  In any case, as  ~muralisr  points out, &quot;fabric-tools&quot; was created as a replacement for the use case of driving the CLI from a docker container." created="2017-06-10 02:50:26.0" updateauthor="greg.haskins" updated="2017-06-10 02:50:26.0"/>

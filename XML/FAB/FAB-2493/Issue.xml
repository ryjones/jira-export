CDATA Code packages should be as lean as possible, containing only the go/c/h files necessary to compile the chaincode into a binary.  This includes the chaincode application any of its dependencies, direct or transitive.  Today, we basically copy the entire $GOPATH/src regardless of its relevance to the chaincode application.  For developers that work with go on multiple projects, this often may lead to many more dependencies being deployed than is strictly necessary.

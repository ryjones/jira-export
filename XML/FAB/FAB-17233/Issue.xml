CDATA The following comment is at the top of {{chaincode_package.go}}:  {code} // The chaincode package is simply a .tar.gz file.  For the time being, we // assume that the package contains a Chaincode-Package-Metadata.json file // which contains a 'Type', and optionally a 'Path'.  In the future, it would // be nice if we moved to a more buildpack type system, rather than the below // presented JAR+manifest type system, but for expediency and incremental changes, // moving to a tar format over the proto format for a user-inspectable artifact // seems like a good step. {code}  This comment is stale with respect to the name of the json file and the case of the keys in the json document.  ></description> </Issue>

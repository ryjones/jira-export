CDATA This process has been pushed to production Jenkins and able to trigger upstream and downstream jobs. Below is the process in experimental stage in production CI.  - upon every patch set submitted to fabric, Jenkins trigger fabric-build-checks-x86_64 CI job and verify the commit message first, if the commit message says WIP, says success +1 on gerrit ignoring build result. If the commit says documentation changes, trigger documentation build job and send the result back to gerrit. If the commit contains code changes like go files, then trigger smoke test job and run the downstream jobs (unit-tests and behave tests ) parallel.  ></body> </Action>

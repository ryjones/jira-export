CDATA  ~bmos299  I think we can close this one now?   Turned out that the "non-deterministic chaincode" bandit struck again.  As an FYI, people need to be aware that there are a number of known non-deterministic functions in Golang (e.g. iterators).     ~kchristidis   is also adding a log message which will make it easier to figure out that this happens.

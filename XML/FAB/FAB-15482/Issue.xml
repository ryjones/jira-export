CDATA When using Service Discovery with TLS and Raft Orderers configured in separate Orderer organizations the Endpoint for each of the Orderers has multiple endpoints. The SDK randomly picks one of these endpoints which is frequently the wrong one. Thus the orderer's tls certificate is not the actual orderer organizations tls certificate. This creates TLS handshake errors trying to establish the connection for sending a transaction to the Orderers.  The console1.log was run with the -Djavax.net.debug=SSL and the BasicConfigurator set. Version of Fabric Components is 1.4.1  ></description> </Issue>

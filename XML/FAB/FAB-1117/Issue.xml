CDATA done via - https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/6119/  Synchronized with 2321 and  ~greg.haskins  work .    With the new build based on docker, there is a simplification that can happen for fabric development - fabric/devenv.  This is correlated with the deprecation/de-emphasize approach being applied toward vagrant.    Only need basic support for git, make, docker and docker-compose.  Also need to articulate that this is optional.  Need to confirm - does an OSX env with homebrew satisfy the above requirements.    Must have gnu-tar for archiving purposes.      ></description> </Issue>

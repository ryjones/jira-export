CDATA Go through JIRA and find what stories with the "ledgers" label and "fabric-ledgers" component have been completed. Compare as to whether there are feature files and scenarios for each story if needed. (may *not* be in the hyperledger/fabric repository under the bddtests directory)  If it seems that a scenario is needed, write a general description of the scenario (not steps) and the associated owner/assignee of the story.  A scenario is a one line test description.  *Output:* A list of scenarios or possible scenarios that will be discussed with a developer/owner.    ></description> </Issue>

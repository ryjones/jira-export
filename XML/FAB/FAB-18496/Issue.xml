CDATA Important to the transparency of a DLT, is the ability to see how the ledger state has evolved over time. For instance, if some good is tracked in a supply chain, it should be possible to see what the state of an asset was at block X (in the past). Currently, Fabric peers only maintain the current and most up-to-date state of the ledger.Â   Currently, Fabric peers store the world state as tuples of (key, value, version). Other DLTs such as Ethereum keep track of historic state by adding this as (key, oldValue, newValue, version). Then, if state at block time T-1 is requested, peers roll back their world state by setting the keys to their oldValue. After requesting an older ledger state, the newValues are applied again. This feature could be very powerful for users demanding greater transparency over how their ledger has changed over time.  ></description> </Issue>

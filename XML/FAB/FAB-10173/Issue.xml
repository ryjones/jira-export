CDATA The validation test has a sample implementation of a validation plugin. There is a missing call to Done() in the code. Since this is just a test, it doesn't affect production runtime, but it might still serve as a reference of how to write a validation plugin.  Therefore, to set a good example - we should also add a call to Done() on the state object after we obtain it.  ></description> </Issue>

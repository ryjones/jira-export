CDATA The dependency on bccsp prevents proper structuring of the code and will result in a rewrite of the package. The proposal from  ~mastersingh24  is to remove the code and, if we need to recreate it, we can do it when the package has been extracted from fabric.  Acceptance: there are no fabric dependencies in shim extensions other than the protos.  ></description> </Issue>

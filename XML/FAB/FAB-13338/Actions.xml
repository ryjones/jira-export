CDATA  ~latitiah  If the existing app doesn't use fabric-network library at all (and it won't since it didn't exist before), then why would you need to install fabric-network?  There should be no requirement to use fabric-network... or am I missing some dependency?  If you want to 'migrate' an existing app to the new programming model, then yes you would need to install fabric-network and make significant code changes.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Maybe that's the distinction that is missing. If there is no desire to use new API calls, but only existing calls, then yes, I agree, the new library is not needed here.   I don't see where the docs on this page differentiate between a migration and an upgrade. It may be helpful to add a note that says "When migrating to use the v1.4 library calls, be sure to install fabric-network@latest as well."  ></body> </Action>

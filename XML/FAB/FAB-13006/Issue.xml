CDATA Where appropriate, PTE must call the new node sdk API for a service discovery request using a sidedb collection name. Design an interface that takes the data from connection profile and/or collection metadata file, and uses it appropriately. Things to consider: when to use a collection name, and which collection name to use, and where to get the collection name, etc. I think the collection name must be used for the service discovery request itself, in addition to the invokes proposals sent to the peers; it is not relevant and not necessary for the transactions broadcasted to the orderers.  This testtask is a task, not a test, but is required for some tests that run sidedb traffic using service discovery.  ></description> </Issue>

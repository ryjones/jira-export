CDATA Currently within many Fabric unit tests which requires to establish networking the ports are assigned statically and hard coded in many places. This raise a problem where developer which writes new UT has to be aware of ports already in use to avoid collisions, since we would like to be able to parallelize our unit tests.  There is a need to develop a mechanism/utility which will allow to dynamically allocate random ports to be used in the unit tests, thus reducing a burden or need to manually track ports which are currently in use.  ></description> </Issue>

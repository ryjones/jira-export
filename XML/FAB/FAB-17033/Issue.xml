CDATA As a user I want a transaction to be invalidated if an endorsing peer has tampered read set So that tampered data is not propagated among other peers     The read set contains only the keys and the versions of the data read during chaincode execution. Thus if the world state of let's say single endorsing peer was tampered, all peers will commit an updated invalid value. On the other hand, if along with the versions there were values in the readset, the peers could compare them with their own and discard a transaction if needed.  the use case is well described in the article    https://medium.com/@kctheservant/exploring-the-behaviour-of-hyperledger-fabric-when-world-state-is-tampered-764676fe90f2   ></description> </Issue>

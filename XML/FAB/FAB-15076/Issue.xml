CDATA In current fabric, there are majorly 2 ways to invoke a chaincode : # To invoke that directly using CLI or SDK on any language #  And we could invoke 1 chaincode from another chaincode using  {code:java} stub.invokeChaincode(chaincodeName, args, channelName){code}  But there's no way that I could get to know from where the call is coming.  For example, I have a chaincode where I want to prevent it from being invoked by another chaincode, this could be implemented in Ethereum. But It's not currently present in fabric or I'm not able to find that.   Or, Imagine a use-case where we would want a call coming from a chaincode being treated differently to that which comes directly to the chaincode.  I personally feel if this is not present, we might want to add this.   ></description> </Issue>

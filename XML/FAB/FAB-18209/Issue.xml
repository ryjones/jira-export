CDATA When we want to remove one orderer from the config block, we need to assure that enough orderers are active. So we delete the nodeID of this order from the activeMap, and compare it with the quorum number. In the current version, we get the nodeID from a dummyOldBlockMetadata, which regenerates all of the nodeIDs instead of the real ones. Then wrong result appear.  I fixed this bug in the function ComputeMembershipChanges like this. This raftInfo is from the chain struct. !1.png!    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The same test case failed for first time in master branch for 1.4.0 images, with same error. I will create a Bug If this fails again as we had some network issues on the build vm's last night.  This test case passed with 2.0 images, and passed with 1.4.0 images in the previous night's build.  fabric-test Commit: *daafa38*  *Error Log* https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-test-daily-pte-release-1.4-x86_64/3/PTE_Test_Logs/FAB-7329-4i-pteReport.log.gz  ></body> </Action>

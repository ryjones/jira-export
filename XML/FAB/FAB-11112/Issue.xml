CDATA In order to facilitate upgrade, we will need to convert the old chaincode install packages to the new format, and persist them.  Note, this will be discarding some of the irrelevant fields, like the instantiation policy, signers, etc. but as they are unneeded in the new lifecycle approach this should not be a problem.  To fulfill this story, there needs to be two utility functions, one which accepts a SignedCDSPackage and outputs name, version, ChaincodeInstallPackage, and one which accepts a CDSPackage and outputs the same.  Note, that the SignedCDSPackage embeds a CDS, so likely the one function will ultimately call the other.  ></description> </Issue>

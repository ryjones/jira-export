CDATA Need automated test to download/test release artifacts across all supported platforms.  Test scripts and environments need to be available prior to release.  Need to perform dry runs prior to release to validate release process.  Need to perform actual tests on day of release.  Note, this does not replace manual trials where a human confirms consumability of release artifacts.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA CLOSED AS DUPLICATE TO FAB-165  The current sample in fabric/sdk/node/README.md is not a completely runnable application.  We should replace with a fully runnable app which does the following: 1) enrolls a bootstrap ID ('admin'), 2) sets registrar, 3) registers and enrolls a new ID 4) deploys, queries, and invokes using the new ID.  It should deploy one of our samples by URL.  ></description> </Issue>

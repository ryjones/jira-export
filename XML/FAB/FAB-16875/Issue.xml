CDATA Today we use Kafka and Zookeeper images published from the Hyperledger Fabric-baseimage repository. Instead of maintaining those images ourselves, I propose we replace them with publicly available images.  Apache now publishes an official Zookeper image. And Bitnami publishes their own kafka images. Bitnami (now part of the VMWare family) has been publishing since the 0.x timeframe and has a daily release cycle where they republish any images where Kafka has merged any new code, regardless of the release.Â   ></description> </Issue>

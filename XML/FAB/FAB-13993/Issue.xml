CDATA The documentation for protocol buffers includes a wonderful note:  {quote} Protocol Buffers and O-O Design  Protocol buffer classes are basically dumb data holders (like structs in C); they don't make good first class citizens in an object model. If you want to add richer behaviour to a generated class, the best way to do this is to wrap the generated protocol buffer class in an application-specific class. Wrapping protocol buffers is also a good idea if you don't have control over the design of the .proto file (if, say, you're reusing one from another project). In that case, you can use the wrapper class to craft an interface better suited to the unique environment of your application: hiding some data and methods, exposing convenience functions, etc. You should never add behaviour to the generated classes by inheriting from them. This will break internal mechanisms and is not good object-oriented practice anyway. {quote}  With respect to that note, we violate it many times and in many ways in the following files:  {code} protos/common/block.go protos/common/block_test.go protos/common/common.go protos/common/common_test.go protos/common/configtx.go protos/common/configtx_test.go protos/common/configuration.go protos/common/configuration_test.go protos/common/ledger_test.go protos/common/policies.go protos/common/policies_test.go protos/common/signed_data.go protos/common/signed_data_test.go protos/discovery/extensions.go protos/discovery/extensions_test.go protos/gossip/compatibility_test.go protos/gossip/extensions.go protos/gossip/extensions_test.go protos/gossip/message_test.go protos/ledger/rwset/kvrwset/helper.go protos/ledger/rwset/kvrwset/tests/kv_rwset_test.go protos/ledger/rwset/rwset.go protos/ledger/rwset/rwset_test.go protos/ledger/rwset/tests/rwset_test.go protos/msp/msp_config.go protos/msp/msp_principal.go protos/orderer/configuration.go protos/orderer/etcdraft/configuration.go protos/orderer/etcdraft/configuration_test.go protos/peer/chaincode.go protos/peer/chaincodeunmarshall.go protos/peer/configuration.go protos/peer/proposal.go protos/peer/proposal_response.go protos/peer/transaction.go protos/testutils/txtestutils.go {code}  ></description> </Issue>

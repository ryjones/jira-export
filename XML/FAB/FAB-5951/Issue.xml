CDATA BCCSP encryption capability currently takes as input the message to be encrypted, the encryption key and algorithm the encryption is to be performed with.   We want to enhance the input provided to the encryption function to consider an IV (for symmetric encryption) or PRNG, that would determine the randomness used in the encryption process.  Currently randomness is derived directly by the system and in the case where chaincodes require more than one endorsements this can result into the two endorsers resulting into two different WriteSets, i.e., different ciphertexts for the same value.   With this enhancement it would be possible for encshim (FAB-830) to be extended to leverage a transient data-passed PRNG or IV to determine the randomness during the encryption process and ultimately support encryption on chaincode side, for chaincodes with >1 endorsements required in their endorsement policy. FAB-5952 is related JIRA issue.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This is an E2E that assumes an identity mixer MSP for clients in addition to the standard E2E test configuration that we have in place.  The genesis block specifies that to enhance the list of MSPs in the chain, a policy needs to be satisfied that excludes anonymous identities. E.g., assuming MSPI1 the identity mixer MSP and MSP 2, 3, 4 the non-identity mixer MSPs, then the policy could be    (Combined(OrgI1.member AND OrgI1.nominal) ) OR( Combined(MSP2.Member AND MSP2.nominal))   The identity mixer client, attempts with the other members of the channel to submit a reconfiguration transaction to add a new MSP; this attempt should fail cause policy evaluation should fail: the identity mixer client id has the anonymity flag on and therefore cannot satisfy the policy.  The MSP2 client should also attempt the reconfiguration request that should succeed.  ></description> </Issue>

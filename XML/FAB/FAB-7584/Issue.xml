CDATA The `init.sh` of the `basic-network` sample deletes the contents of the `.hfc-key-store` and copies peer admin credentials back to the keystore. However this directory called `creds/*` doesn't exist and isn't available at any point in the execution of the sample code in this directory.  Â   This seems to be a bug and should be removed.  ></description> </Issue>

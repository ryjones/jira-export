CDATA The peers currently need access to the docker daemon - that does not mean we need access to /var/run/docker.sock. In existing code, the peer can be configured to use TLS connections to docker in the vm section of core.yaml by pointing to a network based endpoint instead of the bind mounted socket.  Use of Docker swarm is not something the open source project supports and is not on the roadmap. We are, however, considering a pluggable launch mechanism that would allow custom build and launch implementations in custom deployments of the peer without having to rebuild the peer.  ></body> </Action>

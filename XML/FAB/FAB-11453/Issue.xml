CDATA *Reduce Peer privileges on Docker Socket.*  The Fabric Peers currently need access to the docker socket to enable them to create peer chaincode containers.  Full access to the docker socket will allow a peer to create a container with inappropriate privileges that would allow for the escalation of privileges on the host by at least the following two ways # Creating a bind mounted storage with inappropriate mount point # Creating a host privileged container   The FABRIC chaincode does not need either of these privileges.   To conform to best security practices we would like to restrict the peer to carry out only actions it actually  needs.   One suggested way would be as we are using  Docker Swarm as our co-ordination engine to send the container creation request to the Docker UCP using the UCP client bundle.  However the initial attempt at this has failed as it appears that the UCP does not always return the same return codes as Docker Socket.  For example containers/create where the  image does not exist returns error code 404 with the docker socket and 500 with UCP.     We would like to hear if this is been tried by Fabric Community and have documentation around it for others.  ></description> </Issue>

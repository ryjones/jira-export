CDATA The operator tooling exists as a static configuration tool today. In an effort to support additional test scenarios, it should be modified to include the capability of adding additional component to the network. In particular we should be able to add CA's, Peer's and Orderer's.  This story will break out the addition of each component.  Acceptance criteria: I can add a component to an existing, running network.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Right now "make" or "make all" do a whole bunch of things such as build both native/docker, run the unit-tests, run behave, run the linters, etc.  New users looking at the code tend to fire off "make".  Not only is it overkill, but often times behave tests are broken, etc.  We should improve the experience by making the default target do the bare minimum to build a release.  Since we are migrating to a docker oriented build/flow as our first class option, suggest the following:  * make/make-all: becomes equivalent to "make docker" * add "make tests": runs unit-tests and behave * reduce the dependencies implied with "make peer": should only build the peer binary, not all the dependencies like the ccenv container.  ></description> </Issue>

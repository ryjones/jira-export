CDATA best option with node.js is using "Istanbul".  it doesn't require any code changes. As long as the test cases are written, Istanbul can automatically insert itself with runtime instrumentation.  Basic procedures to enable this on CI jobs: - install istanbul globally - "istanbul cover test/unit/headless-tests.js" - print a link to the coverage report html (in coverage/lcov-report/index.html)  In addition, Jenkins has a code coverage plugin that supports Istanbul reports, plus keeping track of coverage trends and generates charts  ></description> </Issue>

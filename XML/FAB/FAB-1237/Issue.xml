CDATA Peer supports "deploy", "invoke" and "query". This task would add an "upgrade" command to the CLI.   The task needs to follow the deploy pattern to create the command under fabric/peer/chaincode in a new file called "upgrade.go". The Command itself can just be a stub for now while the upgrade function gets implemented in the fabric.   A minimal "upgrade_test.go" would need to be written to check the user provided parameters.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fabric-FAQ.html:  has many violations of the Hyperledger Brand Guidelines ( https://www.hyperledger.org/trademark-usage).  Specifically, I saw a lot of violations of: * When referring to a specific Hyperledger software project, *do* use the full project name (e.g., “Acme uses Hyperledger Iroha”) and *do* refer to it as a “framework” or a “tool,” as appropriate (e.g., “the Hyperledger Iroha framework”, “the Hyperledger Explorer tool”).  In many cases, the phrase "the fabric" or just "Fabric" was used.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The cclifecycle package currently uses a static function, DeployedChaincodes, that is hard-coded to check the LSCC for information regarding deployed chaincodes. DeployedChaincodes should move to the LSCC code and this dependency should be wired into cclifecycle.Â   Eventually, once the server code is complete for defining chaincodes with the new lifecycle, a router will need to be added to list the deployed chaincodes for thew new lifecycle in addition to the (old) lscc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This note from upgrade doc is not correct... you do not need to upgrade peers from each org.Â  It is possible to get endorsements from peers of different Fabric versions.  .. note:: Before you attempt this, make sure you've upgraded enough peers from enough organizations to satisfy your endorsement policy. Because the endorsement policy for the chaincode in BYFN is ``"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')"``, you'll need to have at least one peer from each org upgraded before attempting to verify the upgrade.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Capture the instructions (and hints to address things that may cause users trouble) in a operator/README.md. We also have a Readme for the Launcher subdirectory already - however we just rebuilt that as part of the operator, so it is no longer a standaone tool, so we should remove it.  Maybe we should provide an example of how to run it locally, and point to the smoke test suite networkspec and testinput files and the testdriver in regression/smoke folder.

<Issue id="39382" key="FAB-15223" number="15223" project="10002" reporter="grapebaba" creator="grapebaba" type="10001" summary="Improve file storage write performance" description="Many systems supports preallocating space for the WAL which can reduce the data that needs to be synced whenever {{fdatasync}} is called. In particular, if we pre-extend the size of the file, calling {{fdatasync}} will only need to write the data blocks and not the inode. We think it can be used in ledger file storage. ~manish-sethi   ~denyeart " priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-04-18 06:38:10.0" updated="2019-04-18 06:38:10.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="52261"/>

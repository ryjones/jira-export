CDATA Acceptance:  I can place a {{launch}} script in the peer's local file system next to {{detect}} and {{build}}. If present and {{detect}} and {{build}} have been successful, call the {{launch}} script with the following arguments: the path to the build directory populated by the {{build}} script and a path to a JSON file that contains chaincode metadata.  The chaincode metadata should minimally contain key/value pairs for the pem encoded keys and certificates necessary to launch chaincode, a pointer to the chaincode server address required for registration, and the chaincode ID/name.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA At the moment multi raft unit test framework doesn't support updates of reconfiguration, because mocking facilities setup to ignore it:  {code} 	configurator := &mocks.Configurator{} 	configurator.On("Configure", mock.Anything, mock.Anything) {code}  where there is a need to replace this mock with logic which would allow to affect mocked communication infrastructure to reflect configuration changes.  ></description> </Issue>

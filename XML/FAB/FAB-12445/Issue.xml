CDATA The build verify and merge jobs in v1.1 for months all say "unstable" - but that problem is unrelated to the changes being merged. The problem has existed forever in the 1.1 branch of fabric-test; a behave test fails the only 2 scenarios that uses the nodesdk api instead of the CLI.   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/2102/#showFailuresLink  #  orderer.Orderer Service.FAB-3852: Message Payloads Less than 1MB, for solo orderer using the NodeJS SDK interface – @1.3|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/2102/testReport/junit/orderer/Orderer%20Service/FAB_3852__Message_Payloads_Less_than_1MB__for_solo_orderer_using_the_NodeJS_SDK_interface_____1_3_/  #  orderer.Orderer Service.FAB-3852: Message Payloads Less than 1MB, for kafka orderer using the NodeJS SDK interface – @1.4|https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/2102/testReport/junit/orderer/Orderer%20Service/FAB_3852__Message_Payloads_Less_than_1MB__for_kafka_orderer_using_the_NodeJS_SDK_interface_____1_4_/   Possibly, should those tests be propped back and running in 1.1? Was that functionality tooling in behave even finished in 1.1?  This problem is not seen in recent CRs in 1.2 or master.  ></description> </Issue>

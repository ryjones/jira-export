CDATA Java CC has made good progress with https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3218. However its not quite ready yet. Its better to disable it for alpha2 and enable it when its more usable.  The disable will add endorser and CLI checks to error out if accessing java chaincode. We may just prevent install/instantiate of Java CC to make it less invasive.   ~sanchezl   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Implement portworx as a storage class for k8s environment in launcher scripts.  See this for information on portworx https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-deployer/tree/master/entryplan/tools/portworx  Here are the comments from Surya on the above implementation.  I suppose you are not running any restart tests or any performance runs so there is no need to enable persistence if you need data-persistence for your tests... based on test type, either you can use file storage or block storage... (edited)  it is not compulsory to use data persistence for your tests and we are creating and deleting pvc's which are charged hourly during its run (edited)   ></description> </Issue>

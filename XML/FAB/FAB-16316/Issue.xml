CDATA Hi,     The following URL indicates that when we try to upgrade the live network involving binaries, images and channel capabilities - to move from v1.2.1 to v1.4.x - we need to necessarily upgrade to v1.3.0 release.     This is incorrect and wrong. We have upgraded a live network from v1.2.1 release to v1.4.x release directly - multiple times.     Also these instructions are wrong and do not work - when customers use IBM certified and supplied Hyperledger Fabric supported images  not the open and free community supplied images . This is because there are no IBM supplied certified supported V1.3.0 images built by IBM.      As they stand in current format - the instructions lead to confusion, unnecessary work, unnecessary exposure/risk when upgrading live systems and wasted resources.      Please fix these misstated instructions for everyone's benefit.      https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/upgrading_your_network_tutorial.html   +++  Also, if your network is not yet at Fabric v1.3, follow the instructions for  Upgrading Your Network to v1.3|http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/upgrading_your_network_tutorial.html . The instructions in this documentation only cover moving from v1.3 to v1.4.x or from an earlier version of v1.4.x to a later version to v1.4.x.  +++     Thanks.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Modify lifecycle tests to use all supported chars somewhere across the tests for all peer database types to ensure the LevelDB/CouchDB systems all handle the documented supported variations. Consider modifying a lifecycle test to use CouchDB as all existing tests use LevelDB. An existing IT that uses CouchDB can be found in ledger/couchdb_indexes_test.go.  Looking throughout the existing IT tests and system tests, one can see one or more of these (but not all are covered in any one place): hyphen/numerical/underscore/lowercase/uppercase/mixed. I suggest we make sure the released documentation and help texts for the cli "peer chaincode" commands contain the exact list of the supported chars for the chaincode names, and ensure all the supported characters are used in each of the configurations.  Refer to Item 14 of tab "Behave Testcases" of  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741 , which tests underscore/upper/lower characters (and add numerical digits and hyphen and any others if supported by all the components).  One place to look for other tests is fabric/core/scc/lscc/lscc_test.go  ></description> </Issue>

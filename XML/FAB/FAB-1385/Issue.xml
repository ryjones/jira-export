CDATA When log level is set to debug, the orderer write the entire contents of the blocks it prepares and sends twice to the log file. These blocks can get rather large and make the log file less useful. Invoking the lifecycle system chain code, for example, results in a 7MB block. The entire block is added to the log file twice, encoded in 2 different formats, for a total of about 50MB written to the log for a single Block.  These are the log entries that contain the dumps of the Blocks:  orderer_1  |  18:57:32.260     broadcast.go:98:  DEBUG  Prepared block 1 with 1 messages orderer_1  |  18:57:37.380  client_deliver.go:140:  DEBUG  Sent block 1 to client   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Enhance testcase to leverage a new PTE capability to verify/query one or more transactions from the ledger of ALL peers. This will guarantee that gossip distributed transactions quickly throughout the orgs peers.  As a first step, we should modify the "service-discovery restarts" testcase (FAB-10191), to also verify (some) invokes on ALL peers. This capability was added to PTE using  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24723/ Â with FAB-10903. The current plan is to add 10191 to the daily test suite.  Second: this testcase could start with 10191 and add SideDB traffic too (and add more restarts). This sidedb traffic of course will use named collections (per FABN-843) for the invokes and the service discovery requests. Refer also to FAB-10130 "sidedb restarts" which is being deprecated because of this 11447 and 12833/12834/12835.  NOTICE: Due to time constraints, v1.3 is not including sidedb reconciliations, which means we cannot test this until v1.4.  The systest team will simply reexecute FAB-10191 in v1.3 and v1.4 as was done in v1.2. Since 10191 and 12833/12834/12835 tests cover the same basic scenarios in v1.4, then this testcase 11447 is more of a "would be nice" rather than a "required" testcase. Since this is a complicated solution test enveloping several things in combination - it could be deferred until time allows.  ></description> </Issue>

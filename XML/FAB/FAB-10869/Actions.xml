CDATA This doesn't look to be a arch. specific problem. Instead it's cannot fetch the source 00:02:10.913 error: RPC failed; curl 56 GnuTLS recv error (-54): Error in the pull function. 00:02:10.913 fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly However I am pushing a PR via https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10911 which addresses intermittent failure.  FWIW, I tried my patch already in sandbox env. works as expected  https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-daily-ppc64le/54   https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-daily-ppc64le/53   https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-daily-ppc64le/52   https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-daily-ppc64le/51    https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-daily-ppc64le/48   The failures in sandbox env occurs once in a while in non-p arch too. However that said I am working towards it too.        ></body> </Action>

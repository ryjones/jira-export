CDATA The goal of this issue is to figure out if this is okay and document it if it is, and fix it if it isn't.     On master @f17770510c6da766aa8471b3ee633b8d1a36835a     I did 3 runs of each of the following invocations of `make unit-test`.  The default logging level appears to be INFO, which is too chatty for me, personally.  So I set to FATAL, to silence the loggers and encountered failures and hangs til timeout.     Thankfully, only two packages seem to change behavior.  FAIL github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/flogging 0.153s  FAIL github.com/hyperledger/fabric/orderer/common/cluster 1200.588s     For `flogging` the functionality appears to be overridden by environment variables, so I am not 100% sure it's testing what is written.     For cluster, the BlockPuller tests are reading from loggers to determine the current state, looking for things such as "Got Block".     Attached is the failure output only.  ></description> </Issue>

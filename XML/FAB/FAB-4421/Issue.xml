CDATA Different tags are being used on Windows in different parts of the system leading to an undesirable inconsistency.  The docker images are tagged: x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2  The Getting Started tarball is called:  fabric-binary-windows-amd64-1.0.0-alpha2.tar.gz|https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-binary/windows-amd64-1.0.0-alpha2/fabric-binary-windows-amd64-1.0.0-alpha2.tar.gz   Which contains files that unpack to: release/windows-amd64  The difference stems from the use of different commands to determine the architecture in use: either "uname -m" or "go env GOARCH".    {code:java} $ uname -m x86_64 $ go env GOARCH amd64 {code}    fabric/Makefile uses GOARCH in its support of cross compilation.  It would be best to use only one name independently of the tool being used so that we have consistency.        ></description> </Issue>

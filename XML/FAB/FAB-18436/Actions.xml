CDATA The {{mod_policy}} dictates which policy is evaluated to determine if a particular signature set authorizes the config update.  By default, we set this to `Admins`, but you may point it to any other policy you like, such as {{/Channel/Application/org1MSP/Admins}}.  In your case, it sounds like instead of changing the {{mod_policy}}, you have instead changed the {{Admins}} policy itself, now requiring a nonsensical sub-policy which cannot be resolved.  Unfortunately, this change is irreversible as you have modified the policy governing further modifications to be unsatisfiable.  So, for this particular scenario, the only real option is to revert to backup.  It's also strongly encouraged to automate any channel configuration changes and test them in disposable dev environments before pushing to production.  Back in the v1.0 timeframe, we hoped to add some additional policy modification sanity checking, but the changes were considered too invasive and escaped.  Over the years, very few people have attempted to modify the default policies, so these additional checks have never been prioritized, but it would be good to add.  Further, we can and should add some additional mechanisms for un-breaking the channel config in case of other more legitimate failures such as lost keys.  ></body> </Action>

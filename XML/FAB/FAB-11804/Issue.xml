CDATA One of the most common chaincode patterns is using client (submitter) identity for access control decisions, whether that is based on client identity itself, or the org identity, or a client identity attribute.  For example an asset that is represented as a key/value may include the client's identity, and only this client may be authorized to make updates to the key/value.  The client identity library has APIs that chaincode can use to retrieve this submitter information to make such access control decisions.  It is well documented in the client identity library README at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/core/chaincode/lib/cid/README.md , but most people can't find this.  This documentation needs to be pulled into fabric readthedocs. Of course, even the core chaincode APIs are not documented well in fabric readthedocs, we simply point to the chaincode shim interface and provide samples.  So in the short term, simply mentioning this pattern and pointing to the client identity library README may be more feasible.  ></description> </Issue>

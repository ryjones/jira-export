CDATA So it seems like the best place for this would be in our Access Control documentation.   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/access_control.html   Agreed?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="49692" issue="33365" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="That access control topic deals with access to functions on a channel and is more of an administrative thing, therefore that topic makes sense in the operations guide. The newly proposed topic deals with access control within chaincode logic, in fact at the key/value level, which is a very different thing. Unfortunately I don&apos;t think we have a good topic on chaincode to put this in, beyond the chaincode tutorial https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/chaincode4ade.html. So perhaps for now mention it in the chaincode tutorial as another set of APIs available to chaincode authors, and link to the client identity library readme similar to how we link to the core chaincode api interface. And in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/access_control.html you can simply put a notice that for access control within chaincode, see the chaincode tutorial topic that describes it." created="2018-08-31 12:56:57.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2018-08-31 12:56:57.0"/>

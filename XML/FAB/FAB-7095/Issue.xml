CDATA Currently, when chaincode is instantiated, the pulling of baseos is explicitly set to false. We should addÂ a new configuration option under the docker section which allows one to  force the pulling of baseos. By default, it is set to false which maintains current behaviour.  this change may help address situations where a base image is updated to patch vulnerabilities and a peer cluster is using a generic tag for baseos such as "latest".  ></description> </Issue>

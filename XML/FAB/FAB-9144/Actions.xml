<Action id="46201" issue="28872" author="sykesm" type="comment" body="Overall, the locking in the client looks a bit weird. It&apos;s acquired and dropped several times during connect processing without a lot of state checks. Hard to see what&apos;s supposed to happen (I don&apos;t know the usage patterns) so just acquiring a lock around the endpoint to avoid the race. At least it&apos;s serialized inconsistency." created="2018-06-19 13:53:35.0" updateauthor="sykesm" updated="2018-06-19 13:53:35.0"/>

CDATA PKCS11 code started its life as a `cp -r fabric/bccsp/sw fabric/bccsp/pkcs11`. It made sense at the time.  With the updates Angelo has been doing in order to improve test coverage of bccsp/sw, the two packages have diverged greatly.  To fix the duplication, and to get more reliable code coverage, removing duplicates that will not ever be using PKCS11.  Using composition to create a fallback path for the bccsp/pkcs11 provider.  ></description> </Issue>

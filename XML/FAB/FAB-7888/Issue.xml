CDATA Running 'make' in examples/cluster, followed by 'build/compose-up.sh' generates a client.config file with all of the relevant keys for interacting with the generated docker-compose deployment. Specifically, it generates an identity  Admin@org1.net|mailto:Admin@org1.net  for use when interacting with chaincode deployed on the network.  However, instead of using the keys generated for that identity, it uses the server certs.  compose-up.sh needs to be fixed to use the correct keys for the  Admin@org1.net|mailto:Admin@org1.net  identity.     Changeset with possible fix:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17925/   This patch is untested, because I can't get the cluster example to work on the master branch; it worked in a previous version however.  May also be resolved by:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12159/   However, inspecting the relevant artifacts reveals that they have different contents, so they are not equivalent solutions.  ></description> </Issue>

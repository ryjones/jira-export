CDATA  ~nnao  I think that the test failed because you already had the index file in your folder from a previous run. So the index got installed during the first phase, hence it did not give you any error.  Can you please remove the old index files and test again?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~AdnanChoudhury  Thank you for review. I have a question. What does "remove the old index files" mean?  In my understanding, this test checks a response containing no_usable_index from CouchDB. Where is the old index file?  ></body> </Action>

After I deleted META-INF directory then the test became a success.  Do you think it needs to delete those file when executing "make clean" command?     ></body> </Action>

<Action id="52127" issue="33751" author="nnao" type="comment" body="That makes sense. Do you have a Jira for deleting all the newly-created file? If we don&apos;t have it, could I use this JIRA for deleting it?" created="2018-10-12 05:07:12.0" updateauthor="nnao" updated="2018-10-12 05:07:12.0"/>

CDATA Yes, thats a good idea to use this jira. I don't think delete is implemented in the behave backend yet.   Let me tag  ~latitiah  here to see if she agrees that behave statements that delete given files as part of housekeeping should be part of the behave tests.  ></body> </Action>

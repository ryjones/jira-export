CDATA Currently, when you approve a chaincode definition using the new chaincode lifecycle, there is no CLI (or API, AFAIK), that allows you to retrieve all the details of the chaincode definition that I just approved.    In particular, I am looking to confirm that I have specified the correct package ID in my approval before I attempt to commit it.  "peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness" allows me to confirm that I have specified all of the correct details apart from the package ID.  It would be great if a new CLI command "peer lifecycle chaincode queryapprovals" could be introduced that allowed you to retrieve the list of all uncommitted chaincode definitions that you have approved.   ></description> </Issue>

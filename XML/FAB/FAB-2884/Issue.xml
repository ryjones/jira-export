CDATA The FSM was used in the original 0.5, 0.6 chaincode where a state machine approach helped handle different types of requests with different serialization needs. In 1.0, the framework is simplified drastically  * there are no concurrent queries and serial invokes. There are only invokes and they are all concurrent * splitting "deploy" into "install" and "instantiate" further simplifies "Init" handling where the flow resembles "Invoke"  Remove of FSM  has the following benefits * helps to simplify by indirections and callbacks related to FSM * this will have some performance benefit by eliminating need to streamline flows through the FSM. * will make it much easier to add new platforms (this is probably the most important benefit)  This will be split into following tasks * peer side cleanup * shim side cleanup for java * shim side cleanup for go  These are independent tasks as the FSM is an implementation detail that does not bleed component boundaries.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Define a BTL policy for purging the pvt data. This should be specified and managed via a collection specific configuration transaction. However, since the collection related configurations changes would be added to the config transaction at a later point in time, for now, we can manage the BTL policies via core.yaml configurations.  yaml driven configurations is not encouraged to use only in the test environments - primarily because, they are prone to change in an inconsistent manner and could cause inconsistency across replay of transactions (even on a single peer).  ></description> </Issue>

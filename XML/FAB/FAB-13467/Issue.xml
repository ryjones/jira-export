CDATA gRPC server's keep-alive values are important as it may affect both stability and performance.  Currently the peer only allow to config theÂ peer.keepalive.minInterval, however, the following items are also useful sometimes.  // ServerInterval is the duration after which if the server does not see // any activity from the client it pings the client to see if it is alive ServerInterval time.Duration // ServerTimeout is the duration the server waits for a response // from the client after sending a ping before closing the connection ServerTimeout time.Duration  We will expose the config to allow setting values from core.yaml or ENV variables.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi Experts,  I found a case while testing files of ledger.after creating channel and doing some transaction .I inspect the ledger file here */var/hyperledger/production/ledgersData/chains/chains/mychannel* on the peer container of the docker. I am using Byfn. On the above location i found the file which contains data for chain named as *blockfile_000000* .  Now i changed the content of this file manually using my editor and append some string in last of the file.  After doing all the above step I again initiated a invoke to move 10 from A to B as given in byfn. I completed this transaction without any issue. But it should not happen because i corrupted that file.  After doing the transaction new data is appended into old file with my previously added data.  ></description> </Issue>

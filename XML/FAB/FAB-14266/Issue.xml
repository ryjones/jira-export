CDATA Default raft tick interval is increased to 500ms in FAB-13845, and default ElectionTimeout becomes 5s.  Actual random election timeout is then 5s - 10s  in worst case, node starts election 10s after channel is created, at which point peer cli timeout would expire  we could increase {{peer channel create}} timeout to 15s to reduce the flakiness caused by this.  However, this is just a temporary workaround, until FAB-14025 is tackled  ></description> </Issue>

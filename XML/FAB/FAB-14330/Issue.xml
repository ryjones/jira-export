CDATA Add connection profiles as part of the BYFN and EYFN samples. The connection profiles can be used by client applications using the Fabric SDKs to connect to those networks.  Each organisation needs its own connection profile that contains the set of peers that organisation should use to connect to the network. Orderers and channels are not needed, as they can be determined by using service discovery.  Connection profiles can be specified in either JSON or YAML, so provide both.  ></description> </Issue>

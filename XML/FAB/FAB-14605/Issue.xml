CDATA I'll use the concrete example that sparked this. I'm sure there are others.  A fabric network defines the maximum permissible message size at creation time.   As a client - regardless of SDK - a user ought to be able to determine the maximum message size allowed by this network so they can configure my client access methods appropriately.  Currently this is left to the individual SDK implementations rather than being specified by the network owner. It would be far more convenient if it were returned by a network configuration call so clients can act on it - and set their own connection values - appropriately.  This is especially true when the network is managed by a third party and access to configuration is limited.     ></description> </Issue>

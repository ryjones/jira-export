CDATA The check was disabled in FAB-3257 and deals with checking if goroutines that are created during a test are dead after the test ends. It failed because sometimes the number of goroutines that the test started with, was higher than the number it ended with.  It should be re-introduced.  I think we should simply instead of checking that the number of goroutines hasn't changed from the start of the test to the end of the test - check that it didn't increase, because that proves that a goroutine was created at the time of the test and hasn't finished.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Two docker compose files have an invalid syntax in the CouchDB section.  These are the two files concerned:  fabric-samples/fabcar/network/docker-compose.yml  fabric-samples/basic-network/docker-compose.yml  This is the line concerned:  environment:    DB_URL:  http://localhost:5984/member_db   It should be:  environment:     -DB_URL= http://localhost:5984/member_db   It is odd that it does seem to cause a problem.   The defect is being opened since it prevents adding additional environment variables to the CouchDB container.   Additional variables need to be added in order to activate the CouchDB username and password.  Also, it needs to be assessed in the DB_URL is required.  It is not used by Ledger, but I am not sure if it is being used by another part of the sample code.           ></description> </Issue>

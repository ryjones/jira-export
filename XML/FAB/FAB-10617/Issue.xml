CDATA In fabric v1.1, if a user tries to put a JSON doc that has a field name that starts with an underscore, then the simulation passes because a limited validation is performed during simulation (limited to four fields names specifically). FAB-8877 is supposed to enhance these checks.  However, in case existing peers get stuck because of this, a check is needed during validation.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

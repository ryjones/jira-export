CDATA When running the daily OTE target in sandbox (see below for target definition from fabric-test/Makefile)  {quote}svt-daily-ote-tests: pre-req fabric pull-images pull-binaries pull-thirdparty-images 	cd $(HYPERLEDGER_DIR)/fabric-test/regression/daily && ./runOteTestSuite.sh {quote} all OTE tests in master branch, including all fixes up through May 13, we see all daily OTE tests fail. The  fabric-test/scripts/pullBinaries.sh adds fabric-test/bin to the PATH after pulling them, just like in 1.4 (where the tests pass). The jenkins job environment already adds fabric/build/bin and fabric/.build/bin to the PATH. Confusing why this fails in master branch CI test runs.  {quote}23:59:16 Creating OTE ...  23:59:16  1A 2K Creating done  1Bdocker-compose OTE service waiting a bit for fabric containers to stabilize before calling script.sh to create channels and run the test... 23:59:16 ######################################### 23:59:16 #                                       # 23:59:16 #            WELCOME TO OTE             # 23:59:16 #                                       # 23:59:16 ######################################### 23:59:16  fabric-test/tools/OTE/script.sh  Executing TESTCASE=Test_FAB7024_30ktx_1ch_solo_500batchsize 23:59:16 Creating Channels: 1 23:59:16 creating channel testorgschannel1 23:59:16 2019-05-14 02:56:22.957 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized 23:59:16 2019-05-14 02:56:23.003 UTC  cli.common  readBlock -> INFO 002 Received block: 0 23:59:16 $ go build 23:59:16 # github.com/hyperledger/fabric/OTE 23:59:16 /usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/link: running gcc failed: exec: "gcc": executable file not found in $PATH 23:59:16 {quote}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In core.yaml it would be included as ledger.pvtdataStore.purgeInterval: {code:java} ledger:   pvtdataStore:     purgeInterval: 100{code} Since we didn't expect many users to change it, we didn't include in core.yaml so as to not make it overly complicated.  But we have found that due to viper config options cannot be overridden from docker env variables unless they are defined in core.yaml, so I think it does make sense to include it in the future.  Let's change this to an improvement for the future.  ></body> </Action>

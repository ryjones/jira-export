CDATA When an orderer service node is removed from an application channel, it frequently (every 5 minutes by default it seems) tries to replicate disabled chains from all endpoints, including from itself.  Trying to pull from its own endpoint causes WARN in the logs, because block height is always lower than on other nodes: {code:java} 2020-03-16 15:13:37.238 UTC  orderer.common.cluster.replication  func1 -> WARN b8f91 Received error of type 'minimum requested sequence is 74 but orderer3-orderer-org-1:7050 is at sequence 6' from {orderer3-orderer-org-1:7050  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- (12 lines of cert content removed) -----END CERTIFICATE-----  } {code} (this log message is from orderer3-orderer-org-1:7050 itself)  A full log of a replicateDisabledChains-cycle is attached (with the warning above appearing on line 16)  I assume trying to pull a disabled chain from its own endpoint is never useful. At least no warnings should be logged in this scenario.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The {{sampleconfig/core.yaml}} file defaults to disabling leader election and instead setting the peer to be a leader.  This is the wrong default, because enabling leader election fixes a number of potential errors, including peers permanently disconnecting from the ordering service during network partitions, and joining a channel with a genesis block which does not contain the peer's org definition.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I have a network, where I dynamically add new orderers to the network one by one. Every time I run update config transaction and add new orderer to the channel_group.values.OrdererAddresses.value.addresses and to the channel_group.groups.Orderer.values.ConsensusType.value.metadata.consenters  So my initial config contains only 1 orderer. In my flow I join few orderers to the network and then I kill the first orderer which was in initial config.  After this I cannot join new peer to the channel, when I run  cli peer channel fetch 0 -o ${ORDERER_HOST}:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME cli peer channel join -b ${CHANNEL_NAME}_0.block  I can see in the peer logs: "Could not connect to any of the endpoints:  firstOrdererIp:7050 "  As I understand during start peer takes initial config orderer addresses and try join them. but in my case 1 orderer is dead, so it cannot join to it. Can I somehow force peer to use addresses from last config block?  Or manually set which orderer I want to communicate to?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~baohua   What are the implications of removing this. I removed the base-os because it had no reference in the code base, however, it doesn't need to be removed if there is a reason it is there.  Fabric Base Image however needs to be removed. It is no longer a dependency of Fabric itself, we have moved to custom images within Fabric itself. We are preparing a deprecation notice for Base Image, and we walked through the repos in Hyperledger and identified those repos still using it. We've already converted Fabric CA to using custom Ubuntu images by copying code from the Fabric Base Image directly into the repo.  What is the chaincode dependency that prevents this from happening? If there is code in this repo that depends on it, then we need to build custom images contained in the repo to support the execution.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~btl5037 , can you help point out the change in Fabric itself (e.g., Jira issue), then we will consider the appropriate way to change existing integration process.  Currently we are using fabric v1.4, and use those images to finish the integration testing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11096  This is the Jira where Gari removed Fabric's dependency on Base Image. The unfortunate fact is, the Fabric team no longer has any intent on maintaining the Base Image repo, as of right now it has diverged from Fabric itself on Go Versions. We've upgraded all of Fabric's dependencies to Go 1.12.5 but not done the work in Base Image.  On a related note, I'm not sure how integration tests depend on Base Image, I just ran the Python test suite in the SDK after removing the pull for Base Image and the suite passed. Which is the same result we saw in CI with the Gerrit change I submitted. I also dont see anything in CI-Management for the verify or merge job that depends on it either. Can you guide me to how it is used to finish integration testing?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~btl5037 , if i'm correct, that change is for HLF v2.0.0.  However, in v1.4.x (which the python-sdk supports now), it still requires the fabric-base images, which will pull during the docker containers start up if not pulling down before hand.  ></body> </Action>

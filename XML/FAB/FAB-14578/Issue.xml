CDATA Note that blocks are optimistically created, which is much faster than consensus.  A big number gives us better throughput.  However, if leader crashes, this also means that more transactions are likely to be lost.  We need to have a sane default value.  Some simple benchmark result to help with decision making: h4. Test env: 5 orderer procs running locally via integration test. {{MaxMessageCount = 10}}, single channel. 5 client threads per orderer, 10000 tx in total. h4. Measurement: time between the *beginning of traffic* and *receipt of block 1000 from leader* h4. Result: MaxInflightMsgs = 10, Duration = 13.2s MaxInflightMsgs = 128, Duration = 3.7s MaxInflightMsgs = 256, Duration = 2.9s  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA While I agree this is an issue based on how things have been working, before diving in to fix this I think we need to seriously consider removing all of the "Docker" stuff from the peer metadata and relying on *explicit* config parameters to determine which images to use.   ~sykesm  - What do you think?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA My suggestion is to make the makefile support the user providing the variables in an optional `config.mk` file. The main makefile can generate this file inside the build container (based on current values). This will cause the makefile in the container to include the file and learn the variables. This will also cover the GO_TAGS case passed in FAB-14401.       Please look at the CR at  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30964/  to check if this is a valid way.  ></body> </Action>

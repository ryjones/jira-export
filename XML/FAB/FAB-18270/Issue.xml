CDATA When generating a snapshot where the peer is in Debug mode, any payload of non-trivial size will crash the Docker daemon due to the log driver being overwhelmed as the debug logs dump the entire value of the block into the log with a disk of non-sufficient IOPS.  I've been able to introduce this on very-high IOPS performance storage using a payload of 10KB and standard bronze file storage using a 1KB payload, where the disk is of moderate size and thus IOPS are also moderate.  Looks like a call to `readDocRange` on snapshot generation is causing this to be logged on the couchdb logger. Log uploaded showing this.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, PTE clones a copy of fabric-sdk-node in case the user wants to use PTE with the latest fabric-sdk-node code.  However, when fabric-sdk-node is updated, unstable npm packages are published.  The PTE readme should detail how to leverage these unstable packages instead of cloning the latest fabric-sdk-node.  Also need to update path in all PTE/CITest/scenarios scripts.  ></description> </Issue>

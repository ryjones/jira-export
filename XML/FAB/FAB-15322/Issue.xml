CDATA There are some tests that require full membership between peers as a prerequisite but don't assert on that. So there are cases where the tests don't get full membership but still pass. This is unwanted behavior. This task is about failing the tests when full membership isn't established.  In addition, the current ReconnectInterval for the tests is set to 25s which is way too high. This task is also about reducing the ReconnectInterval to 1s  ></description> </Issue>

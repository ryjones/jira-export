CDATA Demonstrate an application layer filter.     Acknowledgement:      Originator:  ~jeffgarratt   Below is a communication diagram illustrating the proposed design.     !filter_app_comm_diagram.png|thumbnail!        A simple relay application connects to the deliver function and forwards the blocks in the transient field to another channel's filter chaincode application.  The filtered block is returned and broadcasted to the filtered channel.  The target recipient connects to the deliver on the filtered channels and receives the filtered blocks through the standard deliver mechanism.  The existing ACL mechanism can be leveraged to control access to the filtered channel.  In addition, the added benefit of an audit trail of all filtered blocks delivered is maintained.  Another added benefit is that the filter function (i.e. the chaincode) can be signed and verified and chaincode lifecycle can be used to manage it's evolution.     ></description> </Issue>

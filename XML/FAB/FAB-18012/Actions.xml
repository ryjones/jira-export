CDATA Fabric-Samples is not meant to be setup manually (though you can do it). It is meant to be configured in its current state using the bootstrapper, which allows the user to specify the versions of dependencies they want to use:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh   So you bootstrap fabric samples by running:  `curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 2.0.1 1.4.6 0.4.18`  Which allows you to specify what version of the fabric images, the CA and the other images you want. You can always rerun the script to get different dependencies.  If someone really wanted to modify the image, they would need only change the `.env` files to specify a different tag. But this requires you to swap out all of the binary, config files, images, for the correct versions, and checkout a compatible tag of fabric-samples.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Using the bootstrap script, I understand that using IMAGE_TAG as latest in fabric-samples does not have any problems, because I make the desired version of the docker image as latest.     Thanks a lot!  ></body> </Action>

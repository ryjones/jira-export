CDATA Not a bug, working as designed, closing...but I do agree it should be possible to remove a chaincode from a peer so that it could be re-installed. I've added a note to consider RemoveChaincode function when the APIs are reconsidered in FAB-16154.  Note, in the interim you can simply delete the chaincode from the peer file system and reinstall, e.g. in /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes directory.  ></body> </Action>

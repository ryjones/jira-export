CDATA The first-network consists of four nodes. However, since the {{byfn}} script installs chaincode for test only on 3 peers. So, an error occurs when invoking the 4 peers from the HLF client.  Of course, you do not need to get success from 4 peers, but I think you should install all for the convenience of the beginners.

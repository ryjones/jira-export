CDATA Hi,  Thank you for your contribution but where does the 4th peer get invoked? Do you mean when the user invokes it outside of the BYFN script?  I believe the intention actually was to show that not all peers have to be endorsing peers so I'm not sure making that change is the right thing to do.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA I understand that not all peers need to be endorsing peers.  I'm just starting to study fabric. After building the first-network using the byfn script, I'm testing with fabric-sdk. So, I invoked it outside of byfn script. Without knowing the fabric yet, running failed and it took a long time to find the error. Perhaps when a lot of fabric beginners like me try to build a network and run things through the byfn script, I think they may encounter errors like me.  In that case, I think it would be difficult to install and call chaincode directly on the peer. (For beginners without knowing why chaincode is not installed on one peer)     If you need, please write what you intended in the guide or install chaincode on all peers. (For beginners)   (guide : https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/build_network.html#install-prerequisites)     Thank you        ></body> </Action>

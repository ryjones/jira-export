CDATA In its current state the Operator tool creates static networks, i.e., you cannot use the Operator to extend a network and add additional components in an automated way, you must generate the MSP and launch the components yourself out of band.  To support additional test scenarios the Operator tool should be extended to include an additional commands to automate the addition of new peers as defined in an additional config section such as:    {code:java} addPeer: - name: org2 mspID: Org2ExampleCom numPeers: 1 - name: org3 mspID: Org3ExampleCom numPeers: 2{code}    If the `addPeers` section exists when a user calls `operator -i <input file> -a addPeer`, the Operator would first validate that org2 and org3 exist (let's assume each had 1 peer already in the network and remembering that the peers start their numbering at 0), the Operator would then generate the MSP for `peer1-org2`, `peer1-org3` and `peer2-org3`.  ></description> </Issue>

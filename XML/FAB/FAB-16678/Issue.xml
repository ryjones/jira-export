CDATA Add a "smoke test" to fabric-test verify job, using new launcher (locally), with new small networkSpec file, generate connprofile, and healthcheck.Â   We may want to open separate tasks for additional pieces:  Second, add and use a simple testSpec pteinput file to create, join, install, instantiate, updateanchor, invoke, query.  Instead of install and instantiate, or in addition, we may want to use the new lifecycle functions (yet to be developed in the Operator and in PTE), e.g. something like package, approve, commit.  Third, add test steps for more functions as they are added. Consider items like upgradecc, configupdate, queryblockheights and compare in all peers (2 orgs with 1 peer), and fetch ledger heights or the final TX from all (1 or 3) raft orderers.  ></description> </Issue>

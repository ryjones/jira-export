CDATA A new error is introduced while fixing FAB-15450. A couple of places, this was ignored because these places are never expected to get this error (as it was working without this before). However, for code consistency, it is better to handle the error.  A couple references where this needs to be fixed -  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/31519/13/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/version/version.go@38  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/31519/13/core/transientstore/store_helper.go@93  ></description> </Issue>

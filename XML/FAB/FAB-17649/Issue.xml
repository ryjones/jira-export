CDATA We should allow the use of any docker image. So we should introduce a new config struct in the spec files to replace `fabricVersion` as follows: {code:java} images: ca: hyperledger/fabric-ca:2.1.0 orderer: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:2.1.0 peer: hyperledger/fabric-peer:2.1.0{code} And so on for each image. This is necessary now that project versions are starting to diverge, we need to be able to specify the exact image we need.  This would also allow someone to plug in their own images pulled from their own dockerhub when using both Docker and Kube.Â   ></description> </Issue>

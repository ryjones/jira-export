<Action id="53106" issue="35147" author="scottz" type="comment" body="This is a logical request, now that we can run tests against any network. Any peer names or org names should be allowed. The restriction is there only because of the original intent of the tool, for a single client to both create the network components and names and also choose which traffic to send to which one. I think this is doable, but will be a disruptive change to the internal storage model for the network components and therefore we should take care to run thorough regression test with PTE and its testcases." created="2018-11-06 22:47:06.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-11-06 22:47:06.0"/>

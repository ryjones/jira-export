CDATA  ~daanporon  Currently calling in the same chaincode in the same channel should not even work as the second call to should be detected and stopped with error.  The peer log will have the error.  If that's not happening, can you attach debug level peer logs (and/or sample chaincodes to recreate).   Also I notice this JIRA is tagged 1.1.0-preview. Is that correct ? I doubt something would have changed but in future lets try with release or master please.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA at the time i logged this error we where using the preview because we wanted to use node.js as chaincode and this wasn't released yet. We where calling the same chaincode but another chaincode function.   Right now it's not possible to easily recreate this, as we have written our chaincode in such a way to work around this issue :(  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When one chaincode invokes another and that other chaincode invokes a function on the first chaincode again you’ll create a circular reference and the first chaincode will think that the call from the second chaincode is actually a response to the first invoke.  SO: chaincodeA.fn1 invokes chaincodeB.fn1 invokes chaincodeA.fn2 when receiving the second invoke chaincodeA thinks this is a RESPONSE to his question ...  We don’t know if this was an issue with the Node.js implementation or just a design issue. Any ideas on how to solve this?  ></description> </Issue>

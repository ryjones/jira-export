(1 orderer, 3 kafka brokers, 3 zookeepers, 2 org with 2 peer each with TLS) 2. Send an invoke transaction 3. Query yields successful results as expected 4. stop zookeeper0  5. Wait 10 seconds 6. Issue a transaction 7. Query results as expected 8. stop zookeeper1  9. Wait 10 seconds 10. Issue a transaction 11. Query results as expected 12. stop zookeeper2 13. Wait 10 seconds 14. Issue a transaction {code}  Expected Result:  expected our transaction fail at step14.   Actual Result: Having no zookeepers did not affect our test and it passed, Query results were as expected, This we think could be a problem based on   Based on the article below something like "how many messages were consumed by each consumer are stored in ZK" http://www.waitingforcode.com/apache-kafka/the-role-of-apache-zookeeper-in-apache-kafka/read   ></description> </Issue>

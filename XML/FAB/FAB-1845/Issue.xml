CDATA In the gossip messageStore, items never expire. Entities like certificates, ledger blocks, alive messages, etc. are stored in a gossip messagestore. We need to make the items expire after a while, because as time goes by, some peers may be offline forever, as well as some blocks need not be stored in the memory for good (even though- their amount of storage is capped).    ></description> </Issue>

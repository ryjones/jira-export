CDATA We need to validate the hash chain (backward hash pointers) when iterating over the system channel when inspecting the channels that exist. Even though the block puller that fetches the channels validates the hash chain in batches, it doesn't verify the hash pointers between the batches themselves.  Since the onboarding puller (unlike the etcdraft one) is equipped with a no-op signature validator and relies on the validity of the bootstrap block in conjunction with the integrity of the pulled hash chain, it doesn't verify the signature of the last block of a pulled batch, thus we need to add this check into the code of the ChainInspector  ></description> </Issue>

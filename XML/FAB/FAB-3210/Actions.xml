CDATA I do not believe this is a bug.  I cannot reproduce.  I've attempted to recreate this locally.  I ran the following:  {noformat} configtxgen -outputBlock foo.block -channelID foo  ORDERER_GENESIS_METHOD=file ORDERER_GENESIS_FILE=foo.block orderer &  configtxgen -outputCreateChannelTx -channelID bar.tx -profile SampleEmptyInsecureChannel  peer channel create -f bar.tx -c bar -o 127.0.0.1:7050 {noformat}  The channel was created and the bar.block was retrieved.  I also tested this in e2e with similar results.  It looks to me like what may have been done to the e2e script was to re-use the variable $CHANNEL_NAME to generate the genesis block.  If you have done this, this would mean that the peer is trying to create a channel with the same name as the ordering system channel, which will most certainly, and correctly fail (causing the e2e test to fail).    ></body> </Action>

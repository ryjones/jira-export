CDATA When a connection gets (re) established, replicas exchange their latest chain state.  This allows a restarted/reconnecting replica to quickly catch up to the network without having to wait for new checkpoints that finally trigger state transfer.  From the code comment:  A reconnecting replica can play forward its blockchain to the batch listed in the hello message.  However, the currently in-flight batch will not be reflected in the Hello message, nor will all messages be present to actually commit the in-flight batch at the reconnecting replica.  Therefore we also send the most recent (pre)prepare, commit, checkpoint so that the reconnecting replica can catch up on the in-flight batch.   ></description> </Issue>

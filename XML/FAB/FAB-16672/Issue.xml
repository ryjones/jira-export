CDATA GOPATH related changes are updated in all the chaincodes in fabric-test/chaincodes folder which are in master branch, but this doesn't work when user try to use 1.4.3 images on fabric-test master branch.  To make this work, we need to add more tweaks in the code. Instead of this we better push all the changes related to release-1.4 branch and make it sync with the fabric 1.4.  Other changes were made recently as well. Most of the master branch fabric-test code changes can be ported to release-1.4, but not everything. Let's determine what is required (and what is incompatible) for running our existing automated tests (using NL)Â cleanly in v1.4.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Resolved this issue and working as expected. Need to maintain/update  sequence number (incremented), change the version string and also code changes. If no code change package-ID wont change and so new version of chain code docker images wont be on peer. In this case your chaincode upgrade step wont show any error but inside peer docker wont be running (kind of confusion)    Mariya  ></body> </Action>

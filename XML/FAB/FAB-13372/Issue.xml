CDATA The various node sdk application samples, upon instantiate or invoke errors, log a generic error message instead of including the specific message that came back from peer.  Here's one example from balance transfer:  "{color:#444444} ERROR  instantiate-chaincode - Failed to instantiate. cause:Failed to send Proposal and receive all good ProposalResponse{color}"  The peer logs typically don't log chaincode error messages for data privacy reasons. So it is up to the client application to get the error message from the peer response.Â  When the samples do not log the peer's error message or return it to the calling app, the root cause of the problem goes unknown. To make matters worse, many people copy the samples for their own applications.  Each of the samples needs to be fixed to report the underlying error message.  ></description> </Issue>

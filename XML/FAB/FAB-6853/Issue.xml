CDATA  Ledger index recovery messages were recently added in FAB-6779 to provide information when ledger index recovery process starts.  Unfortunately these messages also show up in a new orderer with no data, since the index cannot be found for the system channel. These messages also show up each time a new channel is created in orderer. The messages are benign but confusing and should be suppressed or clarified in these scenarios.     2017-11-01 12:40:22.418 CST  fsblkstorage  newBlockfileMgr -> INFO 002 No info about blocks file found in the db.   This could happen if this is the first time the ledger is constructed or the index is dropped.   Scanning blocks dir for the latest info 2017-11-01 12:40:22.418 CST  fsblkstorage  constructCheckpointInfoFromBlockFiles -> INFO 003 No block file found 2017-11-01 12:40:22.418 CST  fsblkstorage  newBlockfileMgr -> INFO 004 Info constructed by scanning the blocks dir = (*fsblkstorage.checkpointInfo)(0xc420374420)(latestFileChunkSuffixNum= 0 , latestFileChunksize= 0 , isChainEmpty= true , lastBlockNumber= 0 )2017-11-01 12:40:22.422 CST  fsblkstorage  syncIndex -> INFO 005 No block indexed, Last block present in block files= 0  2017-11-01 12:40:22.422 CST  fsblkstorage  syncIndex -> INFO 006 Start building index from block  0  2017-11-01 12:40:22.422 CST  fsblkstorage  syncIndex -> INFO 007 Finished building index.

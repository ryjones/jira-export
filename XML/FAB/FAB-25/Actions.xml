<Action id="18524" issue="12324" author="christopherferris" type="comment" body="This user story implies an implementation(lifecycle system cc) and is missing rationale or motivation. Questions: is the user really the chaincode developer or the network stakeholder/owners? eg who needs to manage chaincode deployment policy? Also, there are likely additional stories needed to decompose this even further to address exactly what sort of policy constraints are needed.

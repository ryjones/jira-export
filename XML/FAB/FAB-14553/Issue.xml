CDATA CR - https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29470 ebables lifecycle cache to handle the updates on the hashed state and hence maintain a reverse mapping of `hashes (the keys in the hashed state) -> chaincode name`  The current code can be optimized in two ways 1) maintain the mapping at the global level (require change in the cleanup of entries a bit challenge - i.e., when not being used by any channel)  2) maintain only one entry per Hash(chaincodeName, sequenceNo) as opposed to for all the fields (requires change in the approve transaction such that it always includes sequence number entry at least)  ></description> </Issue>

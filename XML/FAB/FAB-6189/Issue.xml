CDATA Now that we are building with Go 1.9, we can leverage support for Go-based plugins. Given that BCCSPs are meant to be pluggable, the idea here is to implement a "plugin" provider.  The plugin provider will be simple: - implement the bccsp interface - config will take a path to a plugin module as well as a raw map string interface{}   The provider will load the plugin and simply call the matching exported methods.  It should be noted that that plugins will only be useful on Linux platforms, but that's fine since we also provide Docker images.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA {quote}in this function, we must wait for tickInterval.C before executing target function, this lead to useless time waiting for the first try. It shall try first and wait a while for next retry. {quote} We _could_ try first before waiting — and in fact if you want to submit a patch for this I will gladly consider it — but in fact, it's the opposite; It would be useless to attempt to connect right away. Provisioning of resources from the Kafka cluster is not instantaneous. If anything, the acceptable time delays in the E2E CLI will need to be adjusted accordingly.  I will also note that you can adjust the amount of time the orderer waits before retrying:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/orderer.yaml#L163   -I will close this as it's not a bug. If you wish to submit a patch for the retry function, feel free to reopen as an improvement along with the required changeset.-  I noticed that you have assigned this to yourself. Do you intend to submit a changeset for the retry function?  ></body> </Action>

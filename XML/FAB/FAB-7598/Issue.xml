CDATA The def/fabapi package currently has two responsibilities instead of one.  1) Creates default factories 2) Contains the SDK code that creates instances from the factories  The SDK code (2) should be a standalone package (like pkg/fabsdk); and def/fabapi simply injects its factories into that impl (1). This allows other curated package factories to exist under def (e.g., a default that uses a PKCS11 cryptosuite, for example) vs the current default that limits itself to sw.  Currently you couldn't do this properly since def/fabapi actually contain the SDK code... which ironically defeats the idea of a default directory.  The README should be updated to give SDK users guidance on what these two packages are for (and to start there). The GoDocs should also direct users to these packages and be fleshed out better for these two packages, in particular.  On a related (but separate) topic, individual clients should be created from their own packages with appropriate support from the SDK package (rather than the SDK containing constructors for each).      ></description> </Issue>

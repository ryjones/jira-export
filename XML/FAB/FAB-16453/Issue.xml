CDATA in current fabric chaincode implementation(using bookmark),  there is no way to know whether this page is last page(when last page records is same as page size). when returned records array size is zero, i just know that previous page was last page because bookmark always returned  regardless of returned bookmark's validity     is there any other way??            ></description> </Issue>

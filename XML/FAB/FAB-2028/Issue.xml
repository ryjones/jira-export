CDATA Provide docker container log details for unit-tests in Jenkins.  In existing approach we are executing unit-tests in a docker container with  log_driver: none. With the above approach docker container logs are not printing out and it's very hard to identify the failure. Proposed fix is to store docker container log output in a artifact and publish this artifact after every build.  ></description> </Issue>

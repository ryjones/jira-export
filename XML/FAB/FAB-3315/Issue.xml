CDATA Identity.getIdentifier for the default MSP returns the HASH of the x509 certificate representing the identity.  ECDSA signature malleability allows for two valid representations of a signature.  Notice that though we have fixed related issues in ECDSA signatures with BCCSP , certificate validation leverages X.509 golang library that does not consider the same fix.  Given this a certificate who has a valid ECDSA signature under a root CA, can have two valid identities. We want to eliminate valid identity identifiers to one.  Solution: We convert the signature of the certificate to a specific one of the two available valid signature representations, and hash the certificate with that signature representation.  ></description> </Issue>

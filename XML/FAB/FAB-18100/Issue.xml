CDATA The current behaviour regarding chaincode events is as follows:  "Only the chaincode invoked by the client can emit events"  So that means it's not possible to implement a proxy chaincode that invokes another chaincode (child chaincode) because all the events related to this last one will be lost.  This doesn't make sense and becomes a limitation. Events should be thrown in a basic delegate call implementation.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

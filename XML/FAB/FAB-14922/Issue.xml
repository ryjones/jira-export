CDATA Test raft network operation with very large transaction sizes: 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, 8MB,... Ensure that an old known problem has been fixed, concerning large messages (AbsoluteMaxMsgSize exceeding 1.5M batchsize). h3. Setup and Input:  Create a raft network with at least one application channel, similar to the setup described in FAB-13641, and send traffic, with the following exceptions: * Set the abs max msg size to something extremely large, such as 90M; keep the preferred msgsize the same as default value. Larger transactions will simply be alone in their own block. * Use large transactions with large payloads. * With each test iteration, increase TX sizes to use the block sizes, 1M, 2M, 4M, 16M, ... to discover limitation.  h3. Expectations:  Handle transactions and blocks larger than 2MB just fine. At some point, we expect to encounter logs/errors identifying limitations due to inherant size limits in various components. We should identify those limits, and any config paramters that can be tuned.     ></description> </Issue>

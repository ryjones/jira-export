CDATA IPM stands for "Iteration Planning Meeting", so the label basically adds it to the list of stuff for our squad to talk about in our weekly planning meeting.  You can see the board that contains all the IPM items (in prioritized order) https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=219  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jyellick   ~wlahti   ~sykesm  There is a request from  ~dbshah  to backport this to v1.4.5. What are your thoughts on backporting this to v1.4.5?   While the discussion is underway, I'll tag for FixVersion v1.4.5. Please remove the FixVersion if it turns out to not be feasible to backport.  ></body> </Action>

Please remove the FixVersion if it turns out to not be feasible to backport.  In general, it does not make sense to target a closed issue for future work. I'm going to clone this as an open issue.  ></body> </Action>

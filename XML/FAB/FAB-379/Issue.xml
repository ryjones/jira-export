CDATA State transfer has two components, transfer of blocks, and transfer of ledger state.  If block transfer occurs before ledger state transfer, and then a peer crash-faults, the ledger state will not match the block state.  Because peers are assumed to have correct ledger state at startup, this could result in a fork of the blockchain or replying with incorrect data to queries.  The solution to this is to invalidate the state at startup, and verify it before replying to queries or executing invokes.  If the state is invalid, then it should be retrieved from another peer.  ></description> </Issue>

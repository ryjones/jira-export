CDATA At least one customer has asked for separate audit logs from the fabric.  The requirement is that we can produce an audit log that include at least the following actions: add/modify/delete user, deploy chaincode, create/modify/delete subchannel. They also want to include the start/stop node .  I opened this against quality squad, but it will hit multiple areas, so I can move or open additional Jira items as needed.  ></description> </Issue>

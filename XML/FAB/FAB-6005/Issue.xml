CDATA The endorser.getCDSFromLSCC() actually get chaincode data from ledger, instead of get chaincode deployment spec.  There's already a GetCDSFromLSCC() method in core.chaincode package, which does the correct work.  Would suggest to rename it to getCDFromLedger(), as it calls GetChaincodeDataFromLSCC() from the core.chaincode package.  ></description> </Issue>

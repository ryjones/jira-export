CDATA  ~greg.haskins  suggested below approach to run behave tests in docker environment..  1) adding the "$(DRUN) testenv" prefix to the behave target, similar to how we run some other things like unit-test and protos 2) migrating the python setup out of baseimage....the challenge here is that baseimage serves both vagrant and docker, and there are users that will want to continue to run behave natively/within-vagrant therefore, I suspect the best approach for (2) is to extract the python configuration from baseimage in a way that both the fabric.git/devenv and testenv may consume IOW, pull the python config out of baseimage, put it in its own script (say scripts/behave-setup.sh) and have both the vagrant provisioner and testenv dockerbuild call it and lastly, 3) make sure you didnt break behave (or at least, break it worse than whatever state its already in) it was (3) that always scared me off (1) and (2) should be straightforward    ></description> </Issue>

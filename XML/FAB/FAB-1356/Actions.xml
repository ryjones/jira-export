CDATA I think that before we jump to do *any* work on this topic we should first agree and on the contract between the peer and the gossip, and *list* exactly what capabilities this API should expose:  * Which component in the peer (if there is such) needs to update metadata and why? * Which component in the peer (if there is such) needs to Gossip a message and to who? What are the characteristics of the messages? Are they "immutable"? Are they "mutable"? Can they expire? etc. etc. Without this we *cannot* ensure optimal dissemination, if at all. * GetPeers - Which component in the peer needs this functionality? Is it interested in all the peers of the peer's own organization? of a specific channel?   I also fail to see the reasoning behind the breakdown of the interface into 2 different interfaces, when we only have 1 implementation of gossip that provides both of them and this will be the situation for good, since the gossip instance inside the peer was required to be a singleton. What do we gain from the separation?   ></body> </Action>

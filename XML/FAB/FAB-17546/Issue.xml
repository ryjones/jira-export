CDATA As an administrator, I want to use a fit for purpose library to add a new root CA certificate to an MSP configuration.  Acceptance: Starting with a configuration transaction/block, I can call a function that adds CA certificate to the MSP configuration. After this operation, I should be able to create a config update transaction that is ready for the signature workflow.  Minimal certificate validation should be done when processing the function. In particular, reject certificates that is missing the KeyUsageCertSign/CA attributes.  ></description> </Issue>

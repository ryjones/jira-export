CDATA Node SDK docs should defer to Fabric docs for setting up fabric dev env. For one, the links to the Fabric docs are obsolete, as the Getting Started is evolving to address different personas (app developer, network administrator, etc).  Â   I think that the Node SDK developer should be able to leverage the basic network rather than the more complex environment that is oriented to network administrators.  ></description> </Issue>

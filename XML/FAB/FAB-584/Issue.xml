CDATA The committed Gossip API needs to be adjusted to: * Reflect cryptographic methods that exist in the fabric peer by having parameters of similar type in verifications/signing signatures, i.e- use PKI_id like in fabric peer * Provide future support for dissemination of other entities apart from blocks and alive messages, such as block validations, and maybe even certificates (currently to obtain a certificate, an RPC call is made to the membership service) https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1343/ 154955417eebd54424be4820d71f6624aa66e01c  ></description> </Issue>

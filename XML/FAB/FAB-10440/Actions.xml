CDATA This came across my desk today. Should we consider adding this to the transaction topic?   ```The transaction file limitation by default is 64Mbyte. And the file name is like: blockfile_XXXXXX (it starts 000000 and probably ends with 999999). So transaction log limitation is 64Mbyte x 999999 = 61Tbyte. World State is either ledgerDB or couchdb. As far as I know couchdb limitation comes from file system (disk size).```     But I guess before Hyperledger hit limitation, I guess there will be problem in the performance. I'm aware Hyperleder Fabric team is working on archive and/or prune feature to reduce the size of transaction logs and state DB.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Dave Enyeart just confirmed there is no limit, so you can ignore my comment above: there is no size limitation. the blockfile numbers will roll passed 999999 (1000000 and above indefinitely)  ></body> </Action>

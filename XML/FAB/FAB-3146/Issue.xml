CDATA When we send a StateInfo pull request, we currently select a random set of peers from the orgs that are members of the channel.   In case of most peers not being in the channel, they don't have any StateInfo messages to give back, so we just end up wasting resources and time.  OTOH - we can't go to the extreme opposite because there might be lots of peers that are in the channel, and since we don't do periodic (it's event-based) dissemination of StateInfo messages, we'll miss these peers.  So, we perhaps need to select a few peers that we know are in the channel, and also a random set out of all the peers of the orgs in the channel.   ~C0rWin   ~gennadyl  I'm putting this in the backlog as this is a mere optimization and not a vital one.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Refer to failure:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-x86_64/332/testReport/orderer_ote/   QA team should take first look. It only happened on one test, but not any other similar tests; and this is the first and only failure of this type so far. We should monitor for more occurrances in the subsequent daily test runs. We may need to try reproduce separately and collect orderer logs.  Two updates:Â   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21035/  and   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21237/   ></description> </Issue>

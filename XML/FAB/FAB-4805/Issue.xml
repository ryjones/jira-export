(2) Using a separate thread, stop the first kafka broker, wait for 15 seconds, and then stop the second kafka broker. wait for 1minute, restart the third kafka broker and then start the second and first kafka brokers with 15 seconds gap (3) Reconnect the broadcast clients to send the transactions and deliver clients to receive both before and after the orderer restarted * *Artifact Locations*: fabric/test/tools/OTE * *Network Topology*: 3 orderers, 4 kafka brokers, 3 zookeepers, 2 orgs with 2 peers in each * *Client Driver*: OTE * *Input*: go test -run ORD97 -timeout 50m * *Output*: if the test ran successfully, should be able to see pass as the output  ></description> </Issue>

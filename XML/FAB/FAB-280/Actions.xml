CDATA Thanks for point this  ~mastersingh24 .    ~JunanXie  And thanks for raising this. It is a very appropriate thought for the new architecture work. As  ~mastersingh24  mentioned, chaincodes are maintained by the life cycle system chaincode which maintains chaincode as state (specifically in a table of chaincodes). The details are in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/1057 and corresponding JIRA items https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-181, https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-182, etc.  If ok with you, I can move this item to be part of the those JIRA stories and can be flushed out further. Also what do you think of changing subject to "Save chaincode deployment information as state" ?   ></body> </Action>

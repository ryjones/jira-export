Basic workflow of transaction endorsement" we have used for about 100 data science & knowledge engineering  students in the 1Q 2018. We asked the students to make a semantic-conceptual model for 2.  A semantic-conceptual model in the course "Knowldege Modeling" means:  # give for every field a concept description,  # if two or more fields refer to the same non-lexical object type, or lexical object type, give a concept description for that type and give the meaning of the role the instances of the type play in the field;  # give where possible a declarative desciption of each integrity rule the instances of the field are subject to; # define a derivation rule for every field that is input or output; # define the events; #  give illustrating examples. One of the observations was that the quality of the sections 2.1, 2.2 is much better than 2.3 and 2.5, and most students came to the conclusion that it would have been more consistent if a 2.5 was given.  Most of the students had at the end of the course a good grasp of the transaction flow.  We combined this exercise with the same question for fabcar.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a general comment, Sjir, I think you've illustrated – through this wasn't your intention – why it's so difficult to delete or update existing documentation. We don't tend to have a great idea how people are using the docs and which docs they find the most useful.  Rather then focusing on Architecture Explained (which used to be called "Architecture Deep Dive"), it might be better to focus on things that aren't in the TOC and are clearly outdated.  ></body> </Action>

My proposal is to update the 1. System architecture part. That part is now inconsistent with the new ledger topic. My estimate is that the update of this part is not so much work. The sub part that needs most attention is 1.2.1.  Thereafter I believe the updated part 1 and part 2 could become the contents of a separate white paper on HLF. Does that require a new JIRA?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Joe,  Would you be so nice and "instantiate" the sentence below:  Rather then focusing on Architecture Explained (which used to be called "Architecture Deep Dive"), it might be better to focus on things that aren't in the TOC and are clearly outdated.  I will then take a look at those without delay.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Sjir – there are a number of proposals about what to do with Architecture Deep Dive. My own was to delete the entire thing and link over to the white paper (this one:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10228.pdf),  but that proposal hasn't been terribly popular. The other, and more likely, proposal is to delete whatever is outdated and use what's useful as the starting point to several docs, rather than trying to contain a deep look at architecture in one document (as might have been possible when Fabric was not as mature and when there was even more of a mad dash to just get things written down).  Like I said, I think that one can wait for now, as the developers who need to take a strong look at that doc are busy with other things. The more manageable first bite is, like I said, to scrub docs that are clearly not useful.  ></body> </Action>

I wanted to ask attention for the frustration, hence without a WHERE doc= "outdated".  ></body> </Action>

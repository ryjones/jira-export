CDATA We've had lots of discussion and debate on branching strategy in chat and on the mailing list. Time to make a decision and move forward is fast approaching.  The general consensus seems to be on a 2 branch strategy where we have the following branches:  master  release  We would use master for development, and release for the stable releases. The release branch would be made the DEFAULT branch on GH so that people cloning or forking the Fabric repositories would always be getting the latest stable release as the default, as opposed to people pulling from HEAD which would generally be somewhat unstable. This should yield a better end-user experience for people that want to build from source.  Of course, they can always change the branch and access master and the development HEAD if they so choose, but there's some effort involved.Â   People working on Fabric repos would still be pulling the default master branch from Gerrit, and there would be no change to people pushing CRs by maintaining the master branch for development.  We would FF merge master into release when the time comes to cut a release.  Any fixes to release branch will need to be managed on both branches.  So, the point of this JIRA is to have a means of recording consensus. Please vote if you agree to adopt this strategy or leave a comment if you are opposed with the reasons for your opposition.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We might want to take a look at utilizing  go-fuzz|https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz  to test validation paths, to ensure we don't have any nasty uncaught panics.     I guess the real hurdle here is to ensure we have a non instance function that unwraps a transaction from its marshaled protobuf envelope all the way to its application-level representation structs and then throw it to the fuzz test.     This can run in CI and be un-noticed until it finds something....     thoughts?      ~ales    ~sykesm    ~jyellick   ></description> </Issue>

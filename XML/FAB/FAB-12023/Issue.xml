CDATA The new couchdb docker image based off of baseimage 0.4.11 takes a few seconds longer to start up than the prior image 0.4.10.  Perhaps due to the changes inÂ  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24427/  .  This has caused some failures in fabric-samples CI such as: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After 5 attempts, peer0.org1 has failed to join channel 'custom-channel-couchdb' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ========= ERROR !!! FAILED to execute End-2-End Scenario =========== which is getting fixed in FAB-12022 .  This issue is to fix the underlying issue that is causing the delays.  ></description> </Issue>

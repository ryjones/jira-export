<Action id="41623" issue="28333" author="senthil1" type="comment" body=" ~denyeart  Do we run our build on power8 (ppc64le)? As far as I know, our unit tests are deterministic on zOS and x86. Not sure why it is non-deterministic in ppc64le. As per the log, GetHistoryForKey() at ledger is returning an error.  ~manish-sethi  Would it be something related to block store on ppc64le. Anyway, unless we can reproduce the error, we may not be able to debug the issue efficiently. " created="2018-03-14 14:38:33.0" updateauthor="senthil1" updated="2018-03-14 14:38:33.0"/>

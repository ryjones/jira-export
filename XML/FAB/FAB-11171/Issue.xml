CDATA *Description*:  Offer a TMS system with the ability to construct and verify _issue requests_, i.e.,  # As a TMS developer I would like to implement the part of _TMS Issuer_ interface that refers to the generation of TMS issue requests # As a TMS developer I would like to implement the _TMS Verifier_ interface that refers to the verification of TMS issue requests      *Success Criteria*: At the end of this work-item: * the TMS accommodates requests to construct _issue requests_ * the TMS accommodates requests to verify _issue requests_ assuming a mockup of ledger (KVS) as follows: ** *malformed* _issue requests_ or _issue requests_ that do *not* conform with the TMS rules (e.g., correctness of the tokens created) are *rejected* and have *no* impact to the mockup ledger ** *wellformed* _issue requests_ or _issue requests_ that conform with the TMS rules (e.g., correctness of the tokens created) are *accepted* and modify the state of mockup ledger   ></description> </Issue>

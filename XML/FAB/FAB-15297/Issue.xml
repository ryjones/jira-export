CDATA As a Blockchain Developer, I would like to explicitly set my peer's external endpoint advertised to SDK users in Service Discovery, so that I can use Service Discovery to discover peers without implementing a DNS.  Â   Motivation:  As an application developer, I host my fabric network on a docker network. I use the node Fabric SDK on my application to discover other peers in the network so that I can send endorsement proposals to them.  Currently we use the PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT option on the peer for advertising the peer's url in the SDK. However, as the peers are hosted in a docker network (non-host network), the URLs used are only discoverable within the docker network. If I choose to use my host's hostname in that option, the docker containers are unable to bind to that address.  The current work around is to implement a DNS for my client applications to use, and use external port mappings to map to the internal ports the peers are listening on.  We propose to have such an option to speed up development of our applications and networks.  ></description> </Issue>

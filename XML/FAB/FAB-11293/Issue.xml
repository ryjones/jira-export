CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client constructs a request to construct an issue proof by  providing the type and quantity of assets to be introduced into the system, and invokes  the peer API. The peer would need to construct the corresponding issue proof and return  it to the (simulated) client. Acceptance would require that the constructed proof matches  the input parameters of the request.  ></description> </Issue>

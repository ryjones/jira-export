CDATA After further discussion with  ~denyeart  and  ~manish-sethi  it was decided that the approach would be * the ledger returns specific errors for all deterministic errors (i.e. errors that would occur on every peer on the channel * when ledger functions are invoked from the validator, typeswitches for deterministic are required; deterministic errors should simply be logged and ignored; the default case would be handled by returning a validation execution error so that processing on the channel would be halted.  * In case the above typeswitch is not complete (e.g. a new deterministic error is introduced but the typeswitch is not updated), the result would be that all peers on the channel would halt processing, swiftly requiring a patch to fix this. While undesirable, this is the safe fallback to avoid forks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I would let  ~ales  create any item if he wants to create - as the only remaining item was related to organizing validator code differently such that it looks up error type in a map instead of checking the type in-line. Personally, I am not sure if there are many errors and  ~ales  still wants to structure validator code like this.  Further, given the refactoring that we are taking up for validation path, I am not sure whether these errors will anymore be there in the new code.   ></body> </Action>

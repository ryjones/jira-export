CDATA Currently, in order to know whether a tx happened in ledger, the endorser calls GetTransactionByID() and ignore the returned transaction data by checking index and get tx from file storage (which is slow).  See  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/endorser/endorser.go#L417.   However, this is heavy for each tx to retrieve the whole tx data, with the aim is to detect whether there's one with the same tx id.  Would suggest to provide some light-weighted detection method.  By doing this, we would gain measurable performance improvement.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA From here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html  This:  Because the endorsement policy for the fabcar chaincode requires the transaction to be signed by Org1 and Org2, any chaincode invoke using the peer binaries needs to target both peer0.org1.example.com and peer0.org1.example.com. You can pass the following values to your invoke commands to target both peers:    should reflect peer0.org1.example.com and peer0.org2.example.com  Also FWIW -- the embedded values referenced below the above text is CONFUSING. While the concept is correct and the snippet ---peerAddresses is in-fact contained in the command the user used in the previous step, if the user passes the snippet while "following along with the tutorial", it throws an error as it's not a valid command.  Hope this helps.   ></description> </Issue>

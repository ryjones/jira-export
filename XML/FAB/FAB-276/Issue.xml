CDATA I have been failing to do fresh "vagrant up" for a week, and I finally figured out what happened. During certain stage of fresh "vagrant up", the following command is issued: curl -L https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaintool/releases/download/v0.8.1/chaintool > build/bin/chaintool , and it always fails with the message of "curl: (56) SSL read: error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0), errno 104"  So I run the same command in another console and find out the connectivity is quite poor. Maximum download speed is around 3K and drops to 0 from time to time, then eventually timeout. I can wait if it's just slow, but this makes it impossible to successfully finish "vagrant up" !image-2016-08-31-06-37-40-302.png|thumbnail!   ></description> </Issue>

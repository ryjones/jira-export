CDATA I need help - I am trying to configure first-net tutorial to work with crypto-config that uses an external root with one intermediate CA. The configuration is customized for customer test sandbox environment - with FQDN and the customer provided CN names. We are also using same set of certificates for tlsca as well as ca (app) with both CA providers being same externally well known CA.  I can demo our issue in a webex and/or provide all details for you to look at.  At this point - I need help to progress my customer project as this issue is holding up their PoC pilot project.   Here is the actual error message:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  2017-08-19 17:35:55.211 UTC  main  main -> ERRO 001 Cannot run peer because error when setting up MSP from directory /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.abcd.com/users/Admin@org1.abcd.com/msp: err CA Certificate is not valid, (SN: 14347142274732774646150233778247550482)  Could not obtain certification chain, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CDATA  ~jyellick I had quite honestly forgotten all about this. Frankly I wish we didn't have these "Next" links at all, as I don't think they're particularly useful given the way the Fabric docs are structured.   As far as the issue itself goes, this seems to be where it happened:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/8c6452200cf826d5a294c435011cb00a6244a021#diff-6b2a3b2af56ac85765da22d15434ddf9   I remember this issue somewhat hazily, but as I recall, it was due to fact that sections inside "Getting Started" were stubs that were links/docs in themselves (in other words, "Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images" was both a section inside Getting Started as well as a separate doc that would appear in the left nav). This duplication is less than ideal, obviously, so the decision was made eliminate the "Install Prerequisites" and "Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images" sections inside Getting Started and hide the toc to make the left nav look better. Breaking the "Next" button here was seen as better than duplicating entries in the toc (though it's possible we just didn't realize what would happen to the Next button, which is generated by RTD).    ~pandrejko  is that your recollection as well?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'd tend to agree that the previous/next buttons don't strike me as very natural in most contexts, though I'm more than happy to defer to the doc team's expertise here.  Ignoring how it happened / why it's broken, concretely, how do we plan to address? Do we remove the buttons? Can we fix them?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Looking at this in detail, I think a simple way to fix this would be to create separate .rst files for the  topics: h2. ccsdk.rst (Hyperledger Fabric smart contract (chaincode) SDKs)  h2. appsdk.rst. (Hyperledger Fabric application SDKs) h2. fabric-ca.rst  (Hyperledger Fabric CA)     and then add them to the getting_started.rst .. toctree:: as follows:    .. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1 :hidden:  prereqs install  ccsdk  appsdk  fabric-ca      ~joe-alewine What do you think?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~pandrejko   We could do that, but we would have to remove the relevant headers in getting_started.rst like we did for the prereqs and install docs.  Actually, looking at the formatting of the various "section" docs, standardizing the format of these docs is something we probably should look at.  Look at the difference between the bare "Key Concepts" toc: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/key_concepts.html  As compared to the Tutorials toc:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/tutorials.html   Do we want a simple list of docs, or a few paragraphs explaining what's in the section, followed by a list (this would be my recommendation), and remove all of the headers that are causing this problem?  ></body> </Action>

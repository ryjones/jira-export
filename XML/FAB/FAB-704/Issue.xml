CDATA At a high level, the initial configuration defines things like "Only allow clients who have a certificate which is signed by one of these 6 parties", but there is no obvious way to express this in a datastructure.  Especially as more complicated signature schemes must be specified such as "It must be signed by the network owner, and, it must also have 4 of the 7 stake holders sign off as well" the need for a domain specific language arises to express these concepts.  This should be defined in protobuf, as it is how we store and marshal things on the blockchain today.  ></description> </Issue>

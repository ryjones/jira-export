CDATA Patchback FAB-10586  In addition, that fix was a tiny bit incorrect, and we should modify it just a bit (set "found = true" in a slightly different place, up one level of nesting, in both functions). This last modification was done in v1.2 already, but was done within another larger changeset, so please see me or the latest v1.2 code for the details.   ~jtclark  We thought this would be a good one for you. And after the patchback is merged to v1.1,Â please push a new version of the v1.1 PTE image out for the community, and add a comment in this bug to notify the originator.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The {{Reponse.Status}} field is documented as (in {{proposal_response.proto}}): bq. A status code that should follow the HTTP status codes. But the chaincode implementation in golang only considers status codes over 500 as indicating that an error has occurred. This means that 4xx status codes cannot be used to indicate an error.  Make the Java chain code match the behavior of the golang chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

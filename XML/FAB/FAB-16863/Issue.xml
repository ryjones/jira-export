CDATA The service discovery tests currently take around 240 seconds to run locally on my machine.  We should use a single (standard) network configuration as the base, removing the second peer for each org and appending org3 and a single peer. The tested functionality should be collapsed into a single It() test to reduce the overall test time. With these changes in place, the test time is reduced to around 130 seconds on my machine.  ></description> </Issue>

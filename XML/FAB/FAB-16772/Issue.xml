CDATA We will need to update the testInput file template to support option to specify the new cc lifecycle actions (versus the old way of install/instantiate).  In addition, add Operator functions to handle the requested actions, and pass the actions to PTE when needed.     v2.0 feature: lifecycle: notes: *     node-sdk new lifecycle functions may land late January; check with bret harrison. *     create/join will be supported ONLY by peer-CLI commands. *     no more fabric-client (avail as unstable in 2.0, but not published) *     we should add code to fabric-test/Operator to do the admin functions:  fabric-admin (pkg, commit) and fabric-network and fabric-common *     PTE could and should use whatever APIs it needs (some low or some high level APIs of node-sdk); expect to probably use high-level for transactions only  ></description> </Issue>

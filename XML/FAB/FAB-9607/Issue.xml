CDATA # "each group is its own en " -> "each group has" # "result was generated a different time" -> " "result was generated at different time" # As a beginner, it confused me a little bit when I read "in phase 3, each peer will verify that the transaction has been endorsed by ..." because the transaction proposal has been endorsed at phase 1 before being sent to the orderer. After a second thought, I realize in phase 1, it is the application that determines whether to send proposal to the orderer. Application can send any transaction proposal to the orderer; so the peer must verify the transaction by applying the endorsement policy by itself.  If my understanding is correct, I think it may help the reader to understand if this could be explicitly stated.  ></description> </Issue>

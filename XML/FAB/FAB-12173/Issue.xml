CDATA Currently, not all fabric samples have anchor peer configuration. As a result - users are unable to use private data (unless they endorse on all the peers and don't require acknowledgement from peers) and can't take advantage of service discovery.  We should add to all fabric samples, anchor peers configuration at the setup startup.  ></description> </Issue>

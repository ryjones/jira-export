CDATA Previous discuss could be found at https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3326  and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9711/  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5781 brings in lifecycle management of chaincode  Now, once a chaincode container was launched, it will be running forever. There're scenarioes that container is no longer needed and should be stopped.  S1. After chaincode was upgraded to new version, older version container is useless if no other chaincodes leverage this contaienr. It's better to release resources of old version container.  S2. Sometimes users may want to run chaincode for once when they're developing chaincodes in a experiment environment. S3. FAB-5781 adds "Uninstall" and "Deinstantiate" operations to chaincode. For "Uninstall" chaincode, container should be stopped on peer. For "Deinstantiated" chaincode on channel, like "upgrade" operation, if no other chaincodes(other channles) on the same peer leverage this chaincode container, container should be stopped.  Adding TTL to container will check usage status of chaincode containers periodically and stop containers that are not invoked within specified period of time.   ></description> </Issue>

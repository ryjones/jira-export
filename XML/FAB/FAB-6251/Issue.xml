This works fine when you only use cryptogen, but if you then try to use the CA certs with fabric-ca, clients who enroll will have their transactions rejected since their certificate will be valid before the CA which signed it  (fabric-ca sets not valid before to current time - 5 min)." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-09-21 00:15:20.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:14:28.0" resolutiondate="2017-09-28 15:42:40.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="40068"/>

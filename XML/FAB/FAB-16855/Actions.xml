CDATA In order to have more consumable gRPC services, Fabric needs some type of mechanism to authenticate users other than using the generic Envelope (serialize protos) with a signature.  While client/mutual auth could be used, it adds additional (and unnecessary complexity).    A cleaner implementation which still keeps authentication at the transport layer is to use token-based auth.  gRPC allows you to provide different types of credentials for authentication and these are typically token-based.  We do not want to require an external identity / authentication service, so the implementation will also include a built-in authentication service which will consume a signed request and return a token which can then be used to authenticate to token-enabled services.  ></body> </Action>

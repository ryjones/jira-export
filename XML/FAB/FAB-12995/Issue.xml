CDATA Add new functions to the example chaincode https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/chaincode/go/map/map.go to provide the capability to perform a common usecase of read/edit/write (in addition to the pure "write" or "put" functions which exist already for creation of key/values). In this simple chaincode, the "edit" portion of the read/edit/write sequence could be essentially nothing, which is desirable because it allows this same chaincode to be used for fabric/API performance testing of the common getPut and getPutPrivate scenarios for comparisons with and without private data.  ></description> </Issue>

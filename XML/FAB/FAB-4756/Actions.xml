I&apos;d propose to go higher level and number the movements, and in the doc, we could point to &quot;more indepth transaction flow info&quot; and link to the transaction model." created="2017-06-16 20:36:36.0" updateauthor="markparz" updated="2017-06-16 20:40:36.0"/>

What if we did  # Propose Update Transaction # Send Endorsed Update Transaction # Notify Ledger Update  That might make more sense to describe how the transaction flows between the application and the ledger.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To work around the problem. We * deleted the Docker Container as well as Docker Image of the chain code. * installed chaincode * issued transaction.  Peer created the chaincode container and endorsed the transaction.  Thus we could successfully upgrade the network.  Not sure if these are expected steps to follow or the issue needs investigation.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mghasletwala  I see other errors such as this  {code:java} ERRO 889 launchAndWaitForRegister failed: timeout expired while starting chaincode mycc:v0(networkid:dev,peerid:peer0.org1.example.com,tx:d3037fe6d77d604629b847507abd0a0a5567ed29c9b11823f7f6d4a7f1ce53df) {code}  {code:java} Kill container dev-peer0.org1.example.com-mycc-v0 (API error (409): {"message":"Cannot kill container: dev-peer0.org1.example.com-mycc-v0: Container a77c113dc1d650eacc9d76f6fd2c3e3aa7aac066466d0d1d9891224e8970e2dd is not running"} {code}  This makes me thing the chiancode never started for some reason. Its hard to say if this is a bug or not without looking at the chaincode logs as well  (by using appropriate logging levels on the peer to turn on chaincode logging) given that its likely that the chaincode could get not get started in the first place.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We have long moved to 1.2 and no longer concerned about 1.0.6 and its upgrade process to 1.1  Also the logs for peers are attached but we do not have chaincode logs. Nor do we have any environment now to reproduce the issue  Unless it is some kind of defect which might still be there in 1.2 the ticket can be closed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, so this needs to somehow incorporate the additional prose in the command reference docs. I still believe that we need to work smarter, and we need the docs to be consistent with the code. This approach is more likely to yield more accurate docs at less effort.  However, if we are going to add additional content, then that needs to be merged. I'll prototype this with configtxgen  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The BYFN Custom Channel CouchDB tests have been failing from some time on master(1.3.0) and now on release-1.2 because the default DELAY time of 3 seconds combined with 5 retries is not sufficient for the endorser to connect to the peer. This is working if the Delay time is increased to 15 seconds. Can the default DELAY time be extended in fabric-samples.  {code:java} ===================== Channel 'custom-channel-couchdb' created =====================   Having all peers join the channel... + peer channel join -b custom-channel-couchdb.block + res=1 + set +x Error: error getting endorser client for channel: endorser client failed to connect to peer0.org1.example.com:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded peer0.org1 failed to join the channel, Retry after 3 seconds + peer channel join -b custom-channel-couchdb.block + res=1 + set +x Error: error getting endorser client for channel: endorser client failed to connect to peer0.org1.example.com:7051: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded peer0.org1 failed to join the channel, Retry after 3 seconds + peer channel join -b custom-channel-couchdb.block {code}  *Build Logs*  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-samples/job/fabric-samples-verify-byfn-release-1.2/  ></description> </Issue>

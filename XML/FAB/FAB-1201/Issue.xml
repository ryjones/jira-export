CDATA The final work to replace Block2 with Block will complete the major revisions to protos. In addition to ledger, the other components affected by it are * core/committer * tools/dbutility * core/chaincode/exectransaction_test.go (one line...I think) * core/endorser/endorser.go (only one line for testing) * events/producer/eventhelper.go, protos/peer/events.proto (just need to move to Block) after conversion * protos/peer and protos/utils  ></description> </Issue>

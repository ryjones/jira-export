CDATA Studied the various config TX-related outputs in our codebase and this does seem like an omission.  For reference: # `configtx.MakeChainCreationTransaction` does set a tx_id, so you get it via the configtxgen tool when the option to output a channel creation transaction is selected. (`configtxgen.doOutputChannelCreateTx` calls `configtx.MakeChainCreationTransaction`.) You also get this in the calls happening in `peer/channel/create.go` and `broadcast_config/newchain.go`. # However, as you point out, `genesis.Block` does not set a tx_id, so you do not get it via the configtxgen tool when the option to output a genesis block is selected. (`configtxgen.doOutputBlock` calls `provisional.GenesisBlockForChannel` which in turns calls `genesis.Block`.)  Even if the argument is that for some reason the tx_id is not necessary, I'd argue that we should still have it for uniformity's sake.  I'll submit a patch and update this JIRA accordingly.  ></body> </Action>

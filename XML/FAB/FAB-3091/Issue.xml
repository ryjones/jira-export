CDATA While running ledger tests, I noticed that the configuration transactions does not have a txid set. Is this behavior intentional? (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/genesis/genesis.go#L46)  If yes, then we would need to change in the ledger code so as to check for the transaction type and index by txid only for endorser transactions.  Marked one test (core/scc/qscc/query_test.go - TestQueryGetBlockByTxID) as skip in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7929/ which should be un-skipped after we resolve this.  ></description> </Issue>

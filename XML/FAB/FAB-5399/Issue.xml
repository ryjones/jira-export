CDATA I encountered an error when running "npm install" as defined in the "Writing Your First Application" tutorial.  The error indicated that OpenSSL was not installed.  Installing it fixed the error.  The Prerequisites page (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html) should include a step to install OpenSSL.  BTW, I installed version 1_0_2.  Version 1.1.0 did not work.   ></description> </Issue>

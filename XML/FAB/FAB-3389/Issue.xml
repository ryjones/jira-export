CDATA Need metrics from Fabric so users can monitor fabric metrics to be able to support the fabric in a production environment and maintain a high SLA.  1 - Need to create a metrics component, similar to a logger, that allows a developer to easily publish a metric by including a few lines in their code at the point an operation they want to publish a metric for occurs. 2 - This metrics component would publish any metrics to a statsd endpoint that was configured in core.yaml. 3 - Metrics we urgently want published are: 	a - Endorsement Count 	b - rejected endorsement count 	c - validated transaction count 	d - invalid transaction count 	e - Block count 	f - channel count per network g - endorsement response time (including time spent in statedb, e.g. couchdb queries)    Other requests from Fabric solutions:  Provide basic information about deployed chain code on the chain, such as chain code ID, its deployed time, etc；For each chain code, with proper permission, provide invoke/query metrics data such as TPS, consensus latency(average, 50%, 85%), broken down into different chain code API (function)；Provide storage usage information on peer node.

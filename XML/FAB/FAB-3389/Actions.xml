CDATA  ~bjwswang   ~qizhang87  Can you guys post some information on reliability testing of the metrics reporter?  Some things I can think of:  1 - What happens if the back end metrics service is not available?  Do metrics get queued up?  For how long?  Does it store them in memory or on disk?  Want to make sure a large amount of memory and/or disk would not be consumed in this case.  2 - What happens if the metrics component in fabric stops taking requests?  What effect does that have, if any, on anywhere in the fabric where you are trying to send metrics?  Need to ensure that the code that is sending the metrics doesn't block execution while it's waiting or retrying to send or again, queue things up to the point where it causes a reliability issue.     Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The list of metrics listed in Description are important, generic "fabric" ones. However they leave out the crucial metric which organizations and users would be glad to avail of - application specific metrics injected by chaincode. Application Chaincodes do not have access to the Fabric Metric APIs directly. We could enhance the gRPC interface to include metrics. This would be invasive and would need to be done for each chaincode language.   Alternately, this can be easily implemented using a "MetricsEmitter" system chaincode callable from any chaincode. A section has been started in  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xveVQM6e2XeAZBisYRTSfElmeBeYKntnghGyWPtsMSs/edit to expand on this.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="19471" issue="13100" author="jimthematrix" type="comment" body=" ~pmullaney   ~muralisr  can we clarify &quot;peer failure&quot; as related to block events. My understanding is that when a peer crashed and restored, it&apos;ll catch up with the network via state transfer. and as part of that will the blocks that got transferred cause BLOCK and CHAINCODE events to get fired? if yes, then I think we have this mostly covered, as long as the event stream can be re-established in time with the event listener (on the SDK side) while this is happening. or a more robust solution is connecting the peer event stream to a persistent message queue (kafka, websphere MQ, etc.) so that even if the event listener gets restored late, it wouldn&apos;t miss any events." created="2016-10-25 17:33:31.0" updateauthor="jimthematrix" updated="2016-10-25 17:33:31.0"/>

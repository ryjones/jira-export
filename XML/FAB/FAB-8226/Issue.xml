CDATA If an orderer is bootstrapped, requiring mutual TLS, then it only recognizes orderer client TLS certs as valid.  This is because the update code only inspects the "Orderer" and "Application" config groups, and ignores the organization definitions under the consortium definitions.  Because of this bug, if mutual TLS is enabled, consortium org clients will be unable to create any channels (if channels with that org have not already been created).  ></description> </Issue>

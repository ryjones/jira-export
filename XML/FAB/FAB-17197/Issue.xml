CDATA When PTE exits, if the counters are not perfect, it returns non-zero value with a new Error object. It would be helpful to print the json structure with all the test counters, as part of the error object too, so they are readily available to anyone viewing the test results in the CI displays.     /home/jenkins/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/tools/PTE/pte-main.js:1987  throw new Error(' performance_main  Test ran, but failed with errors.

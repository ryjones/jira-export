CDATA Start a network and verify it can handle traffic as described in FAB-17002.  This testcase extends that by adding restarts of the peers and orderers.  After confirming all traffic can be handled without errors and the network is stable, per FAB-17002, apply the *map_private cc* traffic again and include *restarts* of *peers* and *orderers* (suggest by using chaos kube.) _(Share the chaos restarts scripts with FAB-16087 which is being used to implement the operator tool function to allow automation of chaos tests)._  Verify that all proposal requests were routed by sdk to functioning peers using discovery layouts and were processed successfully. Also confirm the transactions are routed to active functioning orderers, and verify transactions all succeed.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA levelDB supports bloom filters, that can increase performance dramatically.   Can you add bloom filters, bits per key and BlockCacheCapacity in config file, so it is easy to configure them. In many real cases this functionality will be needed. For now the only way to enable them is by forking the source and compile custom Fabric.   In my benchmarks, with 1.7 billion keys, without bloom filters, leveldb can do ~100 get request per second. If bloom filters are enable performance goes up to ~18000 get request per second.  Of course, this consume couple of gigabytes of RAM, in this particular case around 5GB, but we need the performance and the servers have the needed amount of RAM. In the ledger we have more than 5 billion keys.  ></description> </Issue>

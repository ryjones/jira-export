CDATA When provided with a reference to a go struct in the source tree, introspect the definition and generate a model that describes the configuration.  The model should include: - The struct field name - The struct field type - The yaml key name of the configuration element - The documentation comment associated with the field - The example value for the field (if any) - The default value for the field (if any) from the {{default}} or {{defaultValue}} tag - For nested structs, an additional model object  As code comments need to be parsed, I expect {{go/ast}} and {{go/doc}} will be required to build the model.  ></description> </Issue>

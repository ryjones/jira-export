CDATA  ~fennelD7  Currently we don't link the chaincode that's installed against the chaincode that's instantiated.  This will be done as part of the "packaging" work described in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2859.  The instantiation record for the chaincode will live on the channel ledger. The record will contain the hash of the installed chaincode package (among other things) which will make sure that "example02_fake" will not be brought up on a peer from its installed package when "example02" was instantiated on the channel.  ></body> </Action>

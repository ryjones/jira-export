CDATA Validate that the Raft ConsensusType.Metadata is valid, i.e. has what "seems" to be valid consenters, options, etc.  Do this before CONTEXT & COMMIT, to reduce the risk of committing to a Raft cluster that cannot boot. Do this in the broadcast phase to provide better feedback to user.  Before COMMIT, as a condition for ordering and executing it, verify that the Raft metadata is the same on all channels. This will ensure that all channels start with the same set of consenters, and thus all succeed or fail to form a cluster, no mixed results.     ></description> </Issue>

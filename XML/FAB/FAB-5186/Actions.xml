CDATA I think the biggest problem is that in gossip, there is a lot of usage of asking the MSP what is the organization of a specific peer. When this is done, certificate sanitation is performed because the certificates use ECDSA.  The certificate sanitation needs to obtain the certificate validation chain in order to locate the parent certificate (that signed the peer's certificate). For this - it calls *x509.Verify()*   There is a plan|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4496  to add a cache which would decrease the need to perform the verification.   ~adc  please correct me if I'm wrong.

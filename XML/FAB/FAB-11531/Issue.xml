CDATA We need to add the ability to package chaincode in the new chaincode package format for the updated lifecycle.  This should come in the form of an extension to the "peer chaincode package" command.  It should take the same options for 'language' (type), and 'path', but it should refuse to allow the 'name', 'version', or 'instantiation policy' to be specified.  Additionally, the '-s' flag should not be allowed.  As with all peer chaincode commands utilizing the new chaincode lifecycle, it should indicate that the new lifecycle should be used with the flag "-N' for use of the new +lifecycle chaincode.  The operation should package the code along with the type and path into the new tar gz chaincode package format and write it to disk.  ></description> </Issue>

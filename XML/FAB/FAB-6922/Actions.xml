CDATA I see `make docker` is not working if hyperledger directory doesn't container fabric repository. If it is available, then make docker works from submodule.  ~latitiah  I have pulled the latest code and uncomment the export variable from the fabric Makefile. Could you please check how your makefile patch worked before? Am I missing any steps?  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This requirement has shifted a bit as we are (as we should be) pulling the latest docker images and binaries from Nexus. There is still a need to build images only when executing interoperability tests.  When a merge takes place, we would build the images and binaries based on the merged repository. As a result, we should rethink how we want to do this. Is using a submodule the best way to get this done?    ></body> </Action>

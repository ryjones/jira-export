CDATA The peer runner integration tests are currently failing when getting the instantiated chaincodes: {code:java} 16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | ------------------------------  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | â€¢ Failure  37.374 seconds   16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | Peer 16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/integration/runner/peer_test.go:27 16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | starts a peer  It   16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/integration/runner/peer_test.go:137  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 |  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | Timed out after 30.000s.  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | Expected  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | <bool>: false 16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | to be true 16:55:46 unit-tests_1 |  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/integration/runner/peer_test.go:229  16:55:46 unit-tests_1 | ------------------------------{code} This is happening for two reasons: * VSCC is now a plugin and, as such, needs the defaults set in core.yaml * the ACL resource for "GetInstantiatedChaincodes" is currently defined as a peer-scoped policy instead of a channel-scoped policy  This task will fix both reasons for the failure.  ></description> </Issue>

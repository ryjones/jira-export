CDATA As a user of Fabric Config Library, I would like to replace policies in bulk like *(*ApplicationGroup)SetACLs()*.     *Motivation:* In the current Fabric Config Library replacing multiple policies in an existing configuration could be a bit tedious. For example, the following methods could be considered to achieve this at present: - Method 1: Repeat *SetPolicy()* and *RemovePolicy()* for the group to be replaced. - Method 2: Use *Configuration()* to get the config struct for the group -> replace the policy fields in that config struct -> then use *SetXXX()* to reconfigure ** NOTE: some groups does not seem to support this way (e.g., *ordererGroup.SetConfiguration()* is skips updating policies)  By providing functions to replace multiple policies in bulk, users can change multiple policies with a single function call, so users should not need a tedious method like the above two.     *Example for usage of the proposed function:* {code:go} a := c.Application() a.SetPolices(newPolicies) // replace the all existing policies in the configuration with newPolicies in bulk {code}    *Targets to add the new functions:* - ApplicationGroup - ApplicationOrg - ChannelGroup - ConsortiumOrg - OrdererGroup - OrdererOrg  ></description> </Issue>

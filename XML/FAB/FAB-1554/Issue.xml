CDATA Gossip protocols leverage an interface to obtain a peer signature/verify a signature and authenticate senders of Gossip messages. We would need to implement this using MSP Manager/interfaces. In particular it requires the completion of these tasks: - Implement simple signature verification using MSP objects  - Implement block verification mechanisms using MSP objects and per-channel related MSP information (in collaboration with  ~jyellick ) - Implement channel MSP replication across all peers of an organization for gossip peers authentication purposes (in collaboration with  ~yacovm )  ></description> </Issue>

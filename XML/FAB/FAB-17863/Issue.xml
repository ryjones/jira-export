CDATA Recently upgrade-dbs added support for remote CouchDB database.  rebuild-dbs should similarly support dropping CouchDB databases.     As an administrator, I want to drop my peer databases including CouchDB state databases, so that the next time peer restarts it will rebuild my databases.     Acceptance: rebuild-dbs should drop databases including CouchDB state databases. The next peer start should rebuild databases including CouchDB state databases using the channel blockchains.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The chaincode support code in the peer sends a READY message to the chaincode after receiving notification of registration. The code path can be shortened (basically avoid a channel notification followed by call to send READY) where the READY is sent immediately following receipt of register from chaincode. This code and codepath reduction further simplifies the chaincode cleanup.  Indeed, we can even collapse the READY with the REGISTER but that would require changes to all chaincode types which is better done later  ></description> </Issue>

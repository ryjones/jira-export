CDATA The fabric runs on single chain held together by the "DefaultChain" defined in chaincode framework. This assumes the fabric can start with a ledger and all components can rely upon it being there.  With multichannels (chains) * there is no one priviledged chain * chains (and hence ledgers associated with them) are created after join  Given the above, we need to sequence chain creation so we can build up the chain. This task begins that work by removing DefaultChain from chaincode framework. This will expose the points in the flow influenced by the chainname (starting from the Proposal into the Endorser).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In order to support snapshot generation we need to enhance PTE to allow the support the querying of the block height in conjunction with sending transactions. After discussing several options we settled on this implementation:  PTE will spawn two processes, one that sends transactions, and a second that manages the snapshot generations. The first process is blind to the existence of the second. The second process will periodically poll the blockheight of the ledger, and once it reaches a predetermined height (supplied by the operator) it send a notification to the first process to clean up and stop sending transactions. The second process will then initiate the snapshot generation process.  Acceptance Criteria: I can generate a snapshot at a predetermined height using PTE  ></description> </Issue>

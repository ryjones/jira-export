CDATA The initial CLI with an example command should be implemented to provide a structural skeleton for the project.   The focus is to design a workflow regardless of the contents of a command.  Commands should be treated equally.     Configuration details should be stored in the local file system.  By default a “.fab” directory should be created at the user’s home directory.  An option should be made available to override this default.     Scripts will be needed to lint, build, and test.   ></description> </Issue>

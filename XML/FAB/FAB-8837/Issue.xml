CDATA This is mostly relevant for identities that include encrypted information, e.g., identity mixer identities. For such identities to be certified that are in possession of certain attributes, or roles, information needs to be passed to it beyond the corresponding msp principal definition.   In this issue we aim at extending the interface of such MSPs to allow a ValidatedIdentity to update its state with the passed input, to enable the latter to decide whether it satisfies certain principals.  Exact design of this is TBD.  ></description> </Issue>

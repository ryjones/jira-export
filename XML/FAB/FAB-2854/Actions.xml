CDATA To elaborate of the OSX issue...  There are actually three distinct steps that need to take place.  First the user needs to install homebrew on their machine: {code:java} /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" {code}   Secondly, the user must add gnu-tar: {code:java} brew install gnu-tar --with-default-names {code}  The gnu-tar step can be finicky.  If this overall process does not work, the user should nuke their clone, re-clone the fabric library, and then proceed with the above command.  Finally, add the libtool: {code:java} brew install libtool {code}  Once complete, all "makes" should compile successfully outside of vagrant.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for the fix  ~mastersingh24 .  By modifying the configtxgen tool to always compile without the pkcs11 support is great for the short-term in that the getting started documentation will work for end-users.   Ramesh and I are working on the packaging of the binaries into a tarball moving forward. Thanks, Barry-   ></body> </Action>

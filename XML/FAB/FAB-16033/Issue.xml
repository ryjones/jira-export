CDATA Observed Incorrect "channel_artifacts" directory location details are mentioned in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/build_network.html  See the below content from the above link  The orderer genesis block and the subsequent artifacts we are about to create will be output into the *channel-artifacts directory at the root of this project*.

CDATA Yacov,  As you are the first maintainer that made the statement that the concept definition for anchor peer in the v1.2 Glossary is misleading, I hope we agree that this needs to be corrected as soon as practicable. Please bring in your proposed concept definition, and I promise you that several members of the Doc WG will help in getting this in the right shape, if additional work is necessary, so that we have it corrected tomorrow. PLEASE and thanks in advance.  ></body> </Action>

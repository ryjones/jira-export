CDATA {code} # Options to be specified for all the etcd/raft nodes. The values here # are the defaults for all new channels and can be modified on a # per-channel basis via configuration updates. Options: # TickInterval is the time interval between two Node.Tick # invocations. # Unit: millisecond TickInterval: 100  # ElectionTick is the number of Node.Tick invocations that must pass # between elections. That is, if a follower does not receive any # message from the leader of current term before ElectionTick has # elapsed, it will become candidate and start an election. # ElectionTick must be greater than HeartbeatTick. ElectionTick: 10  # HeartbeatTick is the number of Node.Tick invocations that must # pass between heartbeats. That is, a leader sends heartbeat # messages to maintain its leadership every HeartbeatTick ticks. HeartbeatTick: 1  # MaxInflightMsgs limits the max number of in-flight append messages # during optimistic replication phase. MaxInflightMsgs: 256  # MaxSizePerMsg limits the max size of each append message. Smaller # value lowers the raft recovery cost(initial probing and message # lost during normal operation). On the other side, it might affect # the throughput during normal replication. MaxSizePerMsg: 1048576 {code} Once chain is started with initial settings of these values, changing them does not take effect. And we should explicitly guard against configuring them.  ></description> </Issue>

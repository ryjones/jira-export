CDATA Assuming I am right, there are a few ways we can go about fixing this one, but the key will be to find something that's both right and minimally invasive. I'm tempted to suggest that the `Batches` channel should actually be a `Blocks` one (that returns objects of type `*cb.Block`). By returning just the slice of envelopes carried by the block we lose the ability to inspect other information carried by the block, such as its metadata.  Perhaps, instead of replacing the `Batches` channel with the `Blocks` one we can have them co-exist for now.  Or maybe there is an easier solution that I'm missing.   ~jyellick : If you have thoughts on this, chime in.  ></body> </Action>

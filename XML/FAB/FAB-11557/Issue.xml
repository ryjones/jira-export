CDATA There are two kinds of  endorsement policy descriptions,  EXPR(E , E... ) expressions in cli and n-of identities strategy in sdk. But when a new participant joins in a channel, the endorsement policy seems out of date, and we will have to propose a new transaction to upgrade chaincode config,  more participants means  higher complexity. More often, in some scenes, we just want to get more than 1/2 or 2/3 votes, so I think current endorsement policy is not flexible.  Some features like distinguished user levels or dynamic set  or some special symbols (not affected by participants join or quit)  can be considered ? For example, we assume A as a set of all organizations and B as a set of some organizations (admin organizations of channels), may be policy is 2/3 agreements from A and all agreements from B. Then when another organization joins in,  it will join set A automatically and the endorsement policy can keep using.  ></description> </Issue>

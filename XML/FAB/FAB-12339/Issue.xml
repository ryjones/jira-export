CDATA Currently node chaincode has hardcoded grpc options which cannot be overridden. Someone who architects and builds a Hyperledger Fabric solution should be able to define the grpcOptions that chaincode should use when communicating with a Peer as the hardcoded defaults may not be appropriate to the architected infrastructure.   This might be something that can be defined in the core.yaml of a peer to define the required grpc connectivity options that a chaincode container should use. This may also be useful for non-node chaincode containers to honour as well.  This originated from Node chaincode, but is equally applicable to Java and Go chaincodes as well.  ></description> </Issue>

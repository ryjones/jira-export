CDATA The solution for this issue needs to be provided by contributors working on the peer and chaincode management. They need to decide how gRPC options for chaincode are configured (core.yaml, environment variables, ?), and how they will be passed into the chaincode containers (environment variables, special file, ?). At that point subtasks can be opened against the various chaincode language implementations to pick up these gRPC options and set them during chaincode startup.  ></body> </Action>

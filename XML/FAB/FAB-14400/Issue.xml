CDATA This will likely require two releases to actually implement, but we finally have the opportunity to rename the default endorsement and validation plugins from "escc" and "vscc" respectively to something sane like... "builtin" or a better name if one can be found.  To begin with, for v2.0, we should provide these new name as an alias to the respective plugin, and enforce in the new lifecycle that the old names are rejected or translated to the new readable name.  Then, for v2.1 when we officially remove support for the old lifecycle, we can entirely remove references to these strings.  ></description> </Issue>

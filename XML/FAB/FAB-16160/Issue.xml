CDATA Convert from python to golang or other means to run the tests and assert/validate the results and generate xml or whatever format is needed by FAB-15587 to report/display the results. Using golang might be a good choice, especially if we also convert the front end of the PTE test driver (PTE/CITest/scripts/gen_cfgInputs.sh) to golang so we could call that (along with the new launcher and operator tools) seamlessly. Also must generate xml at the end, for the CI tools to retrieve and display results.  This includes all files in fabric-test/regression/*/*.py (such as fabric-test/regression/daily/systest_pte.py) in the smoke/daily/release/systemtest suites.  This does not include the behave tests, since those are being deprecated.  Python 2.7 reaches EOL at end of year 2019, so it would be preferable to get this done by then so we don't have to bother upgrading our python version.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA lte test failed first time in test case *perf_couchdb.test_FAB_3873_VaryNumChainWithNoParallelism*, in the last build, <master> branch with 2.0 images.  The same test case passed with fabric 1.4.0 images.   The lte tests started 8 PM EST last night and took almost 4 hours to complete which is the usual build time for lte daily tests.

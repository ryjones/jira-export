CDATA The software-based implementation of the BCCSP interface already provide a modular implementation that allows to plug multiple algorithm wrappers to perform the BCCSP operations. Currently, this modular approach cannot be fully exploited because methods are missing to allow this customisation.  This FAB proposes to refactor the software-based implementation to expose this additional customisation helper functions. In the context of FAB-8930, this would allow to reuse the software-based BCCSP to implement a new BCCSP supporting the idemix options.  ></description> </Issue>

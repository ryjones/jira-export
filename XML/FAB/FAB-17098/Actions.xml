CDATA  ~denyeart  Do you have suggestions on the message? What was provided was the exact output of {{go build -v -mod=readonly ...}}. This boils down a build failure as the {{go.mod}} file included in the chaincode is stale or incomplete implying that the source used at development time will not be the same as the code built on the server.  From my perspective, if we don't care about building with exact package versions listed in {{go.mod}}, we can remove {{-mod=readonly}} from the build.  If it makes you feel better, you're not alone: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29118  ></body> </Action>

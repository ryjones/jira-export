This makes it difficult to directly interact with Fabric nodes from web browsers as gRPC makes use of parts of the HTTP/2 spec which are not currently supported in web browsers.  Today, many people try to put REST servers in front of Fabric nodes which is OK but has multiple issues in terms of protocol translation and even key management." priority="2" status="10100" created="2018-08-22 15:14:09.0" updated="2020-05-01 10:40:16.0" votes="3" watches="4" workflowId="44341"/>

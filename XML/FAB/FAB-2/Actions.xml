CDATA This is actually working as designed.  When you use the REST API to login, what happens is that whichever peer's REST endpoint you are using enrolls with membership services on your behalf (which basically means it registers and downloads all of your enrollment material).  The enrollSecret used for login is actually a one-time password so once you login / enroll one time, you will no longer be able to use that enrollSecret again.  When you logout using the REST API, essentially all that is happening is that your enrollment material is being deleted from that peer (so it is not really a logout in the classic sense).  This stems from the original thought that people would use NVPs as local "virtual wallets" to connect to remote fabric nodes.  But the reality is that this is not the strategy going forward and that is what led to the NodeJS SDK which actually does enroll and download your material from mebership services and will allow you to communicate with all peers using that ID not just a single peer like the REST API.  ></body> </Action>

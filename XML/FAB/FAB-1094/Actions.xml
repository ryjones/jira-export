CDATA Hi Tuan, keep FAB-996 in mind. It seems like there will be no overlap since you talk about unmarshaling functions.  I have written a bunch of unmarshaling functions for the same process here  1 , so you may want to extract them from there, and move them to the same common/util package (file util.go) in the orderer as the one that FAB-996 uses.  It may also make sense to go for unmarshaling functions that return just the proto.Message w/o error to make the calling code cleaner. We should panic inside the e.g. UnmarshalEnvelope() function if need be. (See gist  2  for how I envision this to work for the Marshal function in the same package.)   1  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2179/7/orderer/common/bootstrap/static/static_test.go  2  https://gist.github.com/kchristidis/d03761fcf37b12af45f99366fe53fd1a  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Actually, I take it back -  ExtractEnvelope and ExtractPayload in FAB-996 overlap with some of the functionality that you wish to add, so I'll try to push a changeset during the weekend so as not to block you. Feel free to extend it as you see fit.  ></body> </Action>

I also started on this because Binh wanted something Friday night ... https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2451/  I'll combine both our code sets .  ></body> </Action>

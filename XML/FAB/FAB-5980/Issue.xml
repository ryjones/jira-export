CDATA In the balance-transfer example, the TLS connection to the CA from the client does not perform certificate validation.  In typescript/artifacts/network-config.yaml, the verify option in 'httpOptions' is set to false:  {code:none} certificateAuthorities: ca-org1: url: https://localhost:7054 # the properties specified under this object are passed to the 'http' client verbatim when # making the request to the Fabric-CA server httpOptions: verify: false tlsCACerts: path: artifacts/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pe {code}  This will not verify that the TLS server's cert is signed by a trusted CA (ostensibly those specified by trustedRoots). More documentation on the feature and a working demonstration is necessary.  As it stands, while TLS encryption is enabled, it is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, and therefore is a security vulnerability. Â Showing, via examples and documentation, correct and secure operation of Fabric is necessary for users to make robust applications, and that's why this is filed as a bug.  ></description> </Issue>

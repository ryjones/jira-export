CDATA What necessitates this move is that the Kafka multichain.Chain object returned/expected by HandleChain(), needs to be able to allocate the resources necessary to keep up with its respective chain when the Start() method is invoked by the multichain manager, as the contract of the Chain interface (defined in chainsupport.go) dictates.  Keeping up with the respective chain means that the Kafka multichain.Chain object needs to bring up a producer/consumer that connects to the corresponding chain partition, so it needs to know the chain ID. The only object passed to us during the HandleChain call is an object of type multichain.ConsenterSupport. Therefore, this interface needs to be extended with the ChainID() method.  I've noted the need for this during my review of this changeset: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2763/ (skip to the comment timestamped 11-27 18:52, and its follow-up comment)  If you want to see how this will look in action for the Kafka consenter (coming in a follow-up changeset), please see: https://github.com/kchristidis/fabric/blob/47752ed61fcab1b26207a9e9075c1c793d723912/orderer/kafka/main.go#L128 https://github.com/kchristidis/fabric/blob/47752ed61fcab1b26207a9e9075c1c793d723912/orderer/kafka/main.go#L143  ></description> </Issue>

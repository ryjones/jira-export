CDATA The storage format in the pvt data store was changed from version 1.1 experimental code to 1.2 in order to support purge of pvt data more efficiently. However, in a scenario, when the peer is upgraded from fabric v1.1 experiential to fabric v1.2, the peer does not understand the format from v1.1 experimental and causes a panic.  Note that while upgrade from experimental features is not technically supported, support is being added in the code so that upgrade scenarios do not fail.  ></description> </Issue>

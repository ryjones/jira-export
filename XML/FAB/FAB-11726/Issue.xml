CDATA Test name: Performance test: filtered block events, 2 channels Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with levelDB     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_cc java chaincode, instantiated     transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 10000 invokes concurrently         thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1         thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1         thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2         thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2  Network Topology: docker containers; 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with both channels Client Driver: PTE Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error      each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself     each thread does not receive any event that not associated with the channel it registered The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Install same chaincode on peers with 2 different channels. Define channels with different chaincode definitions. Should be able to execute on both channels successfully  *Proposed Steps:* {code} Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel named "channel1" When an admin sets up a channel named "channel2"  And an admin builds a chaincode package And the organization admins install the built chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package for channel "channel1" using policy "<Some policy>" on all peers When the organization admins approve the chaincode package for channel "channel2" on all peers And an admin commits the chaincode package to "channel1" channel And an admin commits the chaincode package to "channel2" channel  And a user invokes on the channel "channel1" with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  And a user invokes on the channel "channel2" with args  "init","a","100","b","200"   When a user queries on the channel "channel1" with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 1000  When a user queries on the channel "channel2" with args  "query","b"  Then a user receives a success response of 200 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

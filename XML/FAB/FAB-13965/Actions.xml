CDATA The steps executed are as follows: {code}  Given I changed the "Application" capability to version "V2_0" And I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle When an admin sets up a channel named "channel1" When an admin sets up a channel named "channel2"  And an admin packages a chaincode And the organization admins install the chaincode package on all peers Then a hash value is received on all peers  When each organization admin approves the chaincode package on "channel1" with policy "OR ('org1.example.com.member','org2.example.com.member')" And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel "channel1" And I wait up to "10" seconds for the chaincode to be committed And a user invokes on the channel "channel1" with args  "init","a","100","b","200"  And I wait up to "30" seconds for deploy to complete  When each organization admin approves the chaincode package on "channel2" with policy "AND ('org1.example.com.member','org2.example.com.member')" And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel "channel2" And I wait up to "10" seconds for the chaincode to be committed And a user invokes on the channel "channel2" with args  "init","a","1000","b","2000"  And I wait up to "30" seconds for deploy to complete  When a user queries on the channel "channel1" with args  "query","a"  Then a user receives a success response of 100  When a user queries on the channel "channel2" with args  "query","b"  Then a user receives a success response of 2000{code}  ></body> </Action>

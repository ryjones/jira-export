CDATA My proposal for this one:  * Add connection profiles to BYFN, so that they can easily be connected to using one of the SDKs * Add a new option to BYFN that allows you to deploy CAs (similar to the options for specifying CouchDB or Kafka) * Add a new option to BYFN that allows you to skip the install & instantiate of the abstore chaincode * Update startFabric.sh script in FabCar to use BYFN instead of basic-network * Update the FabCar applications to use the BYFN connection profiles and credentials * Update the Writing Your First Application tutorial to reference the Building Your First Network tutorial * Remove basic-network  ></body> </Action>

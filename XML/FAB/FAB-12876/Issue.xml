CDATA Currently the FabCar sample deploys to the basic-network, but this is not ideal as it is not really a realistic network configuration. It only has a single organisation, and a single peer, and it is not configured with TLS. There is also no tutorial explaining the basic-network configuration.  I plan to rebase the FabCar sample on first-network (aka BYFN). This is a much more realistic network configuration, as it has two organisations, and two peers, and it is configured with TLS. There is also a tutorial explaining the first-network configuration - Building Your First Network - that we can nicely link to from the FabCar tutorial Writing Your First Application.  ></description> </Issue>

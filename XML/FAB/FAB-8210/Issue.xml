CDATA In the upgrade doc http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/upgrade_to_one_point_one.html#update-fabric-ca-binary ,  in section "Update Peer Binaries", near sentence `Next, remove all Docker chaincode images.`,  I think we might want to add some more words explaining why it is necessary to delete the images (The chaincode container will fail to connect, maybe explaining a reason or maybe not).  But it is more complicated than that, because my real objective is, per FAB-7915 , for those new words to also mention the same requirement - i.e. to remove the chaincode images - when changing peer binary version from v1.1 DOWN to v1.0.x (when backing down / aborting an upgrade, which is allowed if done before the config updates (PONR)).  We tested this; the chaincode container would fail to connect; chaincode container logs will show `Error starting Simple chaincode: error trying to read file content : open : no such file or directory`  I am not sure if this location in the identified doc is the correct place for adding error messages and detailed explanations for troubleshooting, but hopefully a short explanation could be added; otherwise, is there somewhere else to put such details?  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="40841" issue="27621" author="scottz" type="comment" body="The upgrade doc  http://joestaging-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade_your_network_components_tutorial.html Â clearly states the steps to remove chaincode containers and images during upgrade. It does not even discuss the aborted upgrade scenario, but I think one would follow the same steps (but using the target release to be the lower/downgraded release) and thus the documentation is sufficient. I am willing to close this." created="2018-02-26 16:32:19.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-02-26 16:32:19.0"/>

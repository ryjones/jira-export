CDATA The REST APIs have been removed form the Peers. The main reason is that the Peer (where the REST APIs were hosted) was really not in the ideal position to be performing the tasks, namely deploy, transaction invoke or query, because all of these requests must be done under an enrolled user identity.  a Peer’s role should be a stateless transaction processing engine  it shouldn’t be required to maintain an arbitrary number of user identities  that should be separated out to the application layer  node.js SDK should make it really simple to write a web application that hosts REST APIs for chaincode deploy, transaction invocation and queries.  ></description> </Issue>

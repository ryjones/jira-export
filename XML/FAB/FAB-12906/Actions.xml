CDATA The problem is that suppose some org A and org B joined the channel, when there's a peer belonging to org A that does not join the channel, it cannot verify the msg from peers of org B.  And this will trigger lots of resource waste.  I think it should be OK that for an org, that part of its peers joined a channel. We should reduce the resource waste to handle these unknown certificates.  ></body> </Action>

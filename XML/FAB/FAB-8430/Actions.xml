<Action id="40509" issue="27899" author="bmos299" type="comment" body="This is a regression.  Changing outputs, regardless of the reason, has consequences.  I think the original support should be returned and if you want to add a flag to return the result in another agreed upon format that the binary APIs can consume.  Anyone who has scripted based on the &quot;Query: xxx&quot; string now fails. Mark Parzygnat had pinged me on byfn failing and the fabric-test daily suite had many failures.  There is nothing that irks a customer more than when their application worked yesterday....and fails today.

CDATA I agree, let's revert to the 1.0 behavior of printing Query Response so that existing tests/clients don't break. Assigning to  ~C0rWin .  A new flag can be added for silent or binary mode in 1.2.  FAB-8245 will be re-opened as an Improvement.  ></body> </Action>

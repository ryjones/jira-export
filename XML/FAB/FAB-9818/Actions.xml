CDATA Documenting for reference: This bug was written against the OTE tests; we discovered those tests were already fixed by FAB-10554. However some cleanup was necessary for the same deprecated warnings in the network configuration in the Behave BDD tests in the fabric-test/feature directory, so this CR does that. I add an explanatory sentence to the description accordingly.  Note: the two LTE test failures in the verify job were caused by a known bug: FAB-11743. They are causing the Unstable builds. We can ignore them. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-test-verify-x86_64/1793/#showFailuresLink ledger_lte_smoke.smoke_ledger.test_FAB_9708_CouchDB_VaryNumTxs ledger_lte_smoke.smoke_ledger.test_FAB_9708_LevelDB_VaryNumTxs  ></body> </Action>

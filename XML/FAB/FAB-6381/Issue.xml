Any bug in the validation code (present or future) that causes validation to be skipped would permit an attacker to skip transaction validation altogether (because by default, the transaction is marked as valid). This goes against security principles; we should default to a secure position (e.g. the tx is invalid) and possibly relax that later if the code was able to determine that the tx was valid." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-10-02 13:17:44.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:48:34.0" resolutiondate="2018-05-03 15:56:43.0" votes="1" watches="2" workflowId="40147"/>

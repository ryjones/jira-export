CDATA Because in the new lifecycle scheme, we will require that the package hashes are consistent, users will need to share chaincode packages.  However, there should be no centralized point of trust, so each user should be able to verify that the chaincode package contains the expected code.  Therefore, we need to extend the "peer chaincode package" command to be able to extract a chaincode package and write it out to disk.    This should be accomplished with a new chaincode sub-command 'inspectpackage'.  It should take a path to the chaincode package, and optionally a location to extract it to (defaulting to the current directory).  It should then extract the embedded code package.  ></description> </Issue>

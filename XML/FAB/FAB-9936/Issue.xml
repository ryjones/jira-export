CDATA The current constructor creates new instances of the docker controller provider and the in-process controller provider. Using this mechanism, the providers can't be created with references to their dependencies and, instead, rely on latent dependencies that have been populated via some side channel.  One way to address this may be to have the constructor accept a variadic list of providers (assuming the provider abstraction is still needed). The provider would then need to surface a method that indicates its type. Another would be to directly provide the map of provider type to provide on the constructor.  ></description> </Issue>

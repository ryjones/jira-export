CDATA The information in this doc:  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pluggable_endorsement_and_validation.html   Really belongs in a few separate docs. Suggest combining it with some of the information in  http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html  with some of the higher level info in pluggable endorsement to create an "Endorsement" key concept doc. Then take material from both docs and create an "Operations Guide" doc for endorsement (covering regular endorsement as well as pluggable endorsement, depending on what's still relevant from the older "endorsement" doc.  Then let the rest live in an "Architecture Reference" doc on endorsement.  ></description> </Issue>

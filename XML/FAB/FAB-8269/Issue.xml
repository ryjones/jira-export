CDATA Goals: - Split FabricCAClient interface into two: ** EnrollmentService - users without signing identities use it to signup with a Fabric network ** IdentityManagement - services that require signing identity of a CA registrar *** remove the user parameter from Register/Revoke.Â It represents the CA registrar and should be taken from the client CA configuration. - Add ability to provide attributes on enroll/reenroll. - Reimplement the user store to allow for easy manual cert management. ** Specifically, the use case of enrolling with a certificate issued by a public certificate authority should be supported. - Manage user certificates within the SDK ** save to store on enroll/reenroll  ></description> </Issue>

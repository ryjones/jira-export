CDATA In order to get the Node.js applications to all work in the fabcar directory, you to have to currently perform the following:   For the hyperledger fabric writing your first application tutorial, you need to modify the package.json file in the fabcar directory to have a dependencies section to look as follows:   section "dependencies": \{ "fabric-ca-client": "1.1.0", "fabric-client": "1.1.0", "grpc": "1.10.1"     Then ensure the node_modules directory is deleted under the fabcar directory and do a: npm install   All Node.js apps in that directory should then work. Not ideal, but this is the current workaround.  ></body> </Action>

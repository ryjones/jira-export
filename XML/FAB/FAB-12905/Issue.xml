CDATA I have a channel with 900+ blocks on it. I am installing/instantiating new chaincode on this channel and the response time when instantiating is very slow as compared to a channel with > 100 blocks on it. Instantiating with 900+ blocks can take me 5+ minutes, whereas instantiating with > 100 blocks can take 5-10 seconds (normal response).       I would think block height wouldn't matter when instantiating new chaincode, but I have found this to be the case every time.  ></description> </Issue>

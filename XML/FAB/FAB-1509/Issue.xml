CDATA Take the feedback and review comments from Draft 1 and rewrite it as Draft 2. The goal is to have the subsequent Draft 3 be a completed document that is proposed to the LF fabric community for formal inclusion/publication.  The previous Sprint 8 issue/task for this item - Research and write Draft 1 - is done, and here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1342  Draft 1 is 9 pages. Draft 2 is projected to be 11 pages (Adding Consensus and Writing Chaincode sections). Draft 2 will also include all feedback on all sections.     ></description> </Issue>

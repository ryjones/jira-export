CDATA There is the possibility of non-determinism if a v1.1 orderer receives a request to enable capabilities for any group before all of the orderers have been upgraded to v1.1.  Because the orderer upgrade should be orchestrated by the orderer admins, it makes sense then, to prevent any capabilities from being enabled for the /Channel or /Channel/Application group until capabilities have been enabled for the /Channel/Orderer group.  This will only affect the v1.0 to v1.1 upgrade, as once enabled, capabilities will support mixed versions of orderer and peer networks. (ie, the peer network may upgrade to v1.2 before the orderer network does.)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi Bret,  I did another round of tests also to confirm if the chaincode is fine. It looks okay if I do an instantiation manually without nodesdk.  Instantiation with vendor-ed package is the issue.  However what I need to check is the vendor-ed packages area all on hyperledger fabric 1.05. Specially the hyperledger shim version. This was pointed on the rocket chat. Once those tests are done would update this issue log.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks People - I manage to resolve it after following Yacov's suggestion. The chaincode was govendored with an older version of fabric and when I cleared all - * downloaded a fresh copy of fabric 1.0.5 * set my GOPATH to the correct new FABRIC * govendor +init and external. * copy the vendor folder to my chaincode * Did SDK create-channel, join-channel, install chaincode process - success * Did SDK instantiate-chaincode - this also created the instances of the chaincode images and I could query and invoke too as a test.  I would finish my remaining tasks and if nothing found - would close this from my side.  ></body> </Action>

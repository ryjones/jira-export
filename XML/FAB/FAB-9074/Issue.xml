CDATA The peer/main.go initializes MSP before the cobra command Execute method is called which initializes logging; therefore, even if debug logging level is set, we are unable to see any debug logging for MSP initialization errors which happen as a result of calling "common.InitCrypto".  You can test this for example by improperly configuring the BCCSP section of core.yaml.  This is particularly important when debugging HSM initialization.  Also change the following from a debug to a warning in fabric/msp/mspimpl.go:  mspLogger.Debugf("Could not find SKI  %s , trying KeyMaterial field: %+v\n", hex.EncodeToString(pubKey.SKI()), err)   ></description> </Issue>

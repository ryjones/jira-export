<Action id="60832" issue="39541" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="This seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the policy format.  The {{&lt;MSPID&gt;.&lt;id&gt;}} format does not support OUs, instead it refers to roles.  The current set of possible roles are &apos;Admin&apos;, &apos;Peer&apos;, and &apos;Client&apos;.  So this is not a bug.  It would be a useful addition to the policy parsing language to support OUs, but this is not a bug, rather a new feature." created="2019-06-10 14:48:04.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2019-06-10 14:48:26.0"/>

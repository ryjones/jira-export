CDATA The policy parsing at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/common/cauthdsl/policyparser.go currently only supports parsing policies based on roles, e.g. Org1MSP.admin, Org2MSP.peer.  However, it would be generally useful to allow specification of policies by arbitrary OU rather than by role.  To accomplish this new specification, the policy parsing grammar would need to be updated.  Perhaps to something like {{Org1MSP.OU=master}}.  -------------------- Original bug text below -----------------------  Channel.tx fails after defining a custom signature policy and assigning it to resource:  qscc/GetTransactionByID: /Channel/Application/MyPolicy      The modified version of basic-network sample is attached.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The errors listed in this issue have nothing to do with git submodules. The makefile targets for executing OTE and PTE test are not correct and are attempting to clone the fabric repository. This should not be necessary since the needed docker images should simply be pulled and not built.  See the following console: https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-test/job/fabric-test-daily-ote-master-x86_64/103/console  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Fabric commit:* cc025bf8f223479abc15086d3496632aa6065700  When trying to create a channel using a setup where the MSP ID and MSP name were not the same, a depulicate deserialization error was received from the orderer "MSP Org1ExampleCom is unknown". (Also see attached test run log - example: line 960)   The MSP Org1ExampleCom seems to have been accepted in earlier steps (line 948). When ID and name were set to be the same value (i.e. Org1ExampleCom), everything worked. It should be possible for the MSP ID and Name to be set to different values. 	Name: "Org1ExampleCom" 	ID:     "org1.example.com"    ></description> </Issue>

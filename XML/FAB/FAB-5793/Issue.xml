CDATA When the state module receives blocks from the orderer or from peers, it currently may throw them if it gets filled too quickly.  This has the following undesirable effect: if the peer in question is a leader, it would discard blocks (if it recieved too many blocks too fast from the orderer), and once it did it - it won't ever pull these blocks again until it either has to reconnect to the orderer, or if it is restarted.  ></description> </Issue>

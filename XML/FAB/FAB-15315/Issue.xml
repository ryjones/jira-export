CDATA The purpose of this task is to have PTE support custom chaincode.  design: Define the chaincode arguments as follow: ccType: set to general keyPayLoad:  an array of the chaincode argument indexes to be altered by PTE for each transaction keyPayLoadType:  an array of the argument types, match with keyPayLoad array.  Supported types are: * Fixed: a fixed string with a random length between keyPayLoadMin and keyPayLoad Max * Random: a random string with random length between keyPayLoadMin and keyPayLoad Max * FixedInt: a fixed random number between keyPayLoadMin and keyPayLoad Max * RandomInt: a random number between keyPayLoadMin and keyPayLoad Max  payload size:  an array of minimum payload size for each argument payload type: an array of maximum payload size for each argument  For each transaction, PTE will alter each argument accordingly.   ></description> </Issue>

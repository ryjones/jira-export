CDATA A number of concept docs and tutorials have been added since this doc was written. Need to link out to those.  Also, some of the language here is a bit marketing-y and cringey, e.g.:  "Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture, distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully vetted, open-source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point."  And should be deleted.  Also, latest png files were never added to this doc. Should add those.  ></description> </Issue>

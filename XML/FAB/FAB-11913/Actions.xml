CDATA Hello  ~sang , To my knowledge, javeenv is used to run Java chaincode. There are some quick-browsing uttorials to chek out  here|https://medium.com/@lkolisko/hyperledger-fabric-sdk-java-basics-tutorial-a67b2b898410 , and  here|https://medium.com/@lkolisko/tutorial-invoking-chaincode-from-hyperledger-fabric-java-sdk-e8dea535a1be . To get started developing Java chaincode see  this page|https://openblockchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup/JAVAChaincode/ .    In  release 1.1|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/images  the javaenv image was in fabric/images folder. I have built that for ARM in previous iteration. For release 1.2, I did not find the image. However, it can be so that is built by some other images...I would have to check this.   Someone closer to development of fabric could weigh in here, I would appreciate the help.  Regards, SP      ></body> </Action>

CDATA Repeat FAB-13861mÂ with these differences:  In SETUP section, create two channels, each with 10,000 blocks, instead of just one.  In the INPUTS section, after step 4, while the new orderer4 is onboarding: * Watch orderer4 as it pulls the blocks for one channel. It could take more than 2 minutes to pull 10,000 transaction. Once all done with the first channel, it will pull blocks for the other application channel (before it finally does the systemchannel). * After about 3 minutes, AFTER it completes the first channel AND WHILE still pulling blocks for second channel: ## Start traffic running on both channels, and immediately afterwards, ## Stop and restart the new orderer4  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In this layer we can put (in future) real robust flow control Right now in case of full grpc buffers, Send become blocking and handlers can stop In case we have this layer, we can decide what we want to do - to stop in Send or just return error.  Idea is to keep original message handlers in peer, event and chaincode packages unchanged (almost), but make them to use this layer instead grpc streams.   ></description> </Issue>

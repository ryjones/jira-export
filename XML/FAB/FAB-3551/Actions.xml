Determined that composer sample is currently leveraging a non-standard configuration of the AdminPrincipal setting for the orgs, using Role.Member.  This gives every member admin privledges which in general would not be recommened.  Plan to open a Jira item wrt to fabric-sdk-node which still leverages this mechanism in some of its sample configtx.yaml files.  David plans to rework composer security based upon the information." created="2017-06-22 16:20:24.0" updateauthor="jeffgarratt" updated="2017-06-22 16:20:24.0"/>

Going to inject the composer user&apos;s cert into the associated organizations MSPConfig/admincerts sequence, and then inject into the localMSPConfig/admincerts  for every peer associated with the same organization.

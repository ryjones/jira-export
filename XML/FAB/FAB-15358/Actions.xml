CDATA Do you have gossip set up correctly?  If you don't have gossip set up properly within an organization, then there's no way the peer parameters of the collection definition can be properly enforced.   You also have to have the chaincode installed on the other peers in the org as well even with gossip enabled and properly set up.   ~denyeart    - can you have a look?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~nileshdeotale   Error *"Requested to send to at least 1 peers, but know only of 0 suitable peers"* means that the peer can't find another member of the collection via gossip, however requiredPeerCount of 1 requires at least one dissemination for endorsement to succeed. Usually this means that gossip or the collection has been misconfigured.  I'm not understanding your collection "policy" field with "Unknown macro" in it. Here is a valid collection policy:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/marbles02_private/collections_config.json#L4      ></body> </Action>

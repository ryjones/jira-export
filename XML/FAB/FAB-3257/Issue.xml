CDATA The goroutine check (checks that goroutines are dead after each test) sometimes starts with the wrong number of goroutines and has a false-negative (i.e, started with 4 goroutines but has only 3 of them in the end of the test) so it fails the entire unit test run.  I want to temporarily disable the test and investigate.  ></description> </Issue>

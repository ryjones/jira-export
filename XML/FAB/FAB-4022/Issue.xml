CDATA enable gerrit voting on fabric-behave, fabric-verify-z and fabric-end-to-end CI jobs if it fails.. existing CI setup skips voting if any of the tests fails. On latest commits of each component, e2e tests, behave and unit-tests on z are working as expected.  Before approve patch maintainers has to check the failures (-1) votings on these builds, if the build is failed due to not rebased patch.. better to rebase and reverify or just do reverify incase of false failures.  ></description> </Issue>

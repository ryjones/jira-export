<Action id="54163" issue="35725" author="mastersingh24" type="comment" body="SANs have nothing to do with root signing certificates ... therefore they are not added to the CA root certificate(s).  It seems that you likely want to use the root certificates as TLS certificates as well ... which is again not intended and actually is likely to fail with some libraries as the proper usage extensions are not specified" created="2018-12-02 14:09:00.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2018-12-02 14:09:00.0"/>

CDATA This change allows for the use of the cryptogen tool to bootstrap certificate data for a set number of organizations with a single command and config file. While at the same time allowing for the ability to use the fabric-ca-client using the existing certificates generated from cryptogen.   In order for this to be able to take place, the ability to have additional DNSNames should be allowed (as it is allowed if using fabric-ca server directly).   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The TLS certificate is generated from fabric-ca-server if one is not set when starting the server. This generated certificate will contain the additional hostnames if the server start command adds the hostname to the {code}--csr.hosts{code} option. For example, {code}--csr.hosts ca.example.com,localhost{code} adds localhost as a SAN to the certificate.   It should also be noted that the current codebase does not support IP address SANs.  ></body> </Action>

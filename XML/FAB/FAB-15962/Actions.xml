<Action id="66886" issue="41217" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="This looks to me more likely to be a bug in *fabric-test/tools/PTE/pte-execRequest.js*. It is passing *undefined* as an argument to both *Channel.removeOrderer()* and *Channel.removePeer()*. The argument should be an Orderer and a Peer object respectively. Also, that test code is not handling promise rejections and letting them fall out to the Node runtime." created="2020-01-22 10:08:09.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-01-22 10:08:48.0"/>

CDATA A couple of things that are unclear from the write-up:  # OSN A belongs to cluster at time T. At time T+1, a request to create channel "foo" comes in, and it doesn't include A. Does A commit the genesis block for "foo"? My understanding is that it does. # "Currently, when an orderer is restarted" - It's unclear to me why the "restarted" part is a necessary condition here?  ></body> </Action>

Yeah... that's what existing OSNs do. That's why I want the onboarding OSNs to reach the same state as existing OSNs. 2. Ah, you're right. it is confusing. I wrote it at 2 AM, and I was thinking about a situation where you're removed from the channel membership and then restarted.  I should've just said "whenever a chain is created"   ></body> </Action>

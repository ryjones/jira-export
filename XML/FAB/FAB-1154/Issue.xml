CDATA The ability to have endorsements from peers that are not part of the target channel.  +*Rationale*+  * There may be a channel where there are a limited number of peers. * There is a need to require more endorsements than there are reliably peers in the channel. * There are other peers that may see the data, but should not store it.  +*Restrictions*+  * The writes are append only (no updates, and no deletes to existing data). * If there is a version problem (2 transactions attempt to append the same key value) then it would fail at commit time.  +*Changes to the Client SDK*+  The client needs a way to request append-only endorsement for a channel that is different than the endorsement channel.  +*Changes to the Endorser+*  The endorser should be able to create a write set without having access to the target ledger.  +*Changes to the Committer*+  The committer should raise exception if an attempt to commit fails due to a duplicate key.   ></description> </Issue>

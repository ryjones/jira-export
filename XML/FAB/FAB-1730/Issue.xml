CDATA When I send a register request to the cop server, it gives back the response:   {"success":true,"result":"VFhSa1lqa0NpSkRs","errors":  ,"messages":  }  However, when I tried to enroll the user with the secret given, the server tells me that the password is incorrect because the password is base64 encoded.  I need to decode the secret in order for it to be usable.  ></description> </Issue>

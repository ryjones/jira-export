CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to remove values from a config and expect no error to occur if the value attempting to be removed does not exist. If a value being removed doesn't already exist then it should be expected that the resulting updated config doesn't contain the value being removed inherently so there is no need to error in these cases. Consider removing the returned error entirely if it makes sense.  Â   *Acceptance*  Calling a removal function with a value that does not exist does not return any error. The GoDoc should clearly explain this behavior.  ></description> </Issue>

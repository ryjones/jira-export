CDATA As an integration test author, I want to be able to populate a cryptogen {{Config}} struct, and call the {{generate}} function on it to create the relevant crypto artifacts.  I cannot do either of these things however because both the {{Config}} struct and the {{generate}} functions are located in the {{main}} package.  Besides artifact generation, having access to the {{Config}} struct means that I can easily infer the right values of the {{LOCALMSPDIR}} and {{TLS_*}} ENV vars of orderers or peers, and set them when creating a cluster runner.  I suppose that the solution here involves exporting all of these constructs and moving them into a separate package (that a barebones cryptogen {{main}} package would then invoke).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a message is gossiped via forwarding, it is simply added to the batching emitter and then decided to which peers to be sent according to all kinds of decisions based on the message type, origin, etc. etc.  The decision of to which the message is sent doesn't take in account the peer the message came from. There is no reason to send back the message to the peer from which the message came from.     ></description> </Issue>

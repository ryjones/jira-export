CDATA +*Setup:*+  Network Topology: 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, each peer with CouchDB container for stateDB, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels. Client Driver: PTE +*Test Steps:*+ 1) chaincode: each channel has one chancode, marbles02 go chaincode, instantiated  2)transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 250000 queries concurrently with tx id from 1 to 0.3 million/4           thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2  3) 1 million rich-queries of 2-field spread among 2 channels  +*Result*+: 1)hardware setup 2) RPS (request per second) achieved for queries 3) CPU and memory usage for the Peers and CouchDB containers  ></description> </Issue>

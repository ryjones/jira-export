CDATA In order to support chaincode upgrade better, and avoid those buggy risks, and even to simplify the DB drivers, I guess we need some abstraction layer on top of all those DBs.  Then, the question would be what kinds of DBs we plan to support in future, e.g., only No-SQL, or every type.   Abstraction layer for only No-SQL is somehow easier to design than to support both from the beginning. I suppose there are some existing work we can refer to.    ></body> </Action>

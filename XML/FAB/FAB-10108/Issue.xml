CDATA In the docs file peers/peers.md, shortly after the figure represented by the anchor "Peer8", there are a couple alleged markdown links back to the figure using the notation:  {{... in the  example above (#Peer8), ...}}  but the generated links don't appear to take the reader back to that figure. Is that the proper way to create a markdown anchor and link in the same doc?  ></description> </Issue>

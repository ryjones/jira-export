CDATA We need to fix the script and instruction with the {{ccenv}} container in {{fabric-samples/chaincode-docker-devmode}}.  Currently, the command to start the network fails with the following error messages. {code:java} $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yaml up ...  Creating chaincode ... error ...  ERROR: for chaincode  Cannot start service chaincode: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:345: starting container process caused "exec: \"/bin/bash\": stat /bin/bash: no such file or directory": unknown ...  ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project. {code} It seems that {{bash}} is not installed on {{ccenv}} container because {{libtool}} that depends on bash is removed from {{ccenv}} by FAB-15670 updates.   So, we need to modify the command for {{ccenv}} in {{docker-compose-simple.yaml}} to use {{/bin/sh}} instead of {{/bin/bash}}.     Also, we need to modify the instruction to build and start chaincode for the same reason.  ></description> </Issue>

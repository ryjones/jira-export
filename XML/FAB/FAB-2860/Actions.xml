CDATA  ~stchrysa  - interesting idea to add this, but can you please expand on how you see this being used in practice?  For example, how are the shares distributed to various peers, what happens when new peers are added to any given "group", etc.  I like the concept of threshold signatures, but I think that figuring out how to managed and distribute the crypto artifacts / material is actually more of the issue than actually implementing the algorithms.  Did you have some intended use case / scheme in mind here?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Possible use cases are the following: # Replacing the centralized user authentication in membership service provider # Signing blocks of transactions as part of a BFT consensus protocol: Instead of verifying a vector of signatures, only one signature needs to be verified. # Providing a threshold signature service that can be used for smart contract applications. # In transaction endorsement: Instead of verifying a signature from each endorser, verifying only one (assembled) signature. Each endorser signs instead with a threshold signature share.  As a part of my MSc thesis the last point (4) has been implemented.  The end to end flow is presented in the following diagram:    !endorsement.png|width=579,height=256!  The implementation of the endorsement flow is however now outdated.

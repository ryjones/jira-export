CDATA The goal here is to create a tutorial for how to deploy a production Fabric network on Kubernetes (as this is, as of recently, our preferred deployment method). To keep the tutorial to a reasonable scale, I think this should, in general, dictate a happy path for deployment, though we should take note of common use cases and the configuration options associated with them. After all, one of Fabric’s main selling points is its versatility. We need to highlight that while making sure not to drown our users in options (paralysis by analysis). We do have a plan to extend the current Operations Guide in the future (hopefully using the same process, if this goes well), so don't feel compelled to fit everything into this Deployment Guide.  I’m seeding this doc with (admittedly vague) descriptions of the big steps and would encourage everyone to extend/correct where they see fit. Where relevant, feel free to include code snippets, lists of configuration options, or anything else that will help users setup their networks. Let’s just get the material out there and then we can shape it (I suspect we might have to spread this material over several docs). Note that this flow presumes a “Network Initiator” type role where they’re setting up a lot of the structure themselves and then inviting others.  Here's the link to the google doc:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtMsi8bK054VhDV-TzXXYF0v1Lfgy9Lu3zRAdJkWUfo/edit?usp=sharing   The doc is open to be edited by anyone with the link, so send the link (or a link to this JIRA) to relevant SMEs as you see fit.  ></description> </Issue>

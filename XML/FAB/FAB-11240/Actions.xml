CDATA Joe,  May I suggest to replace the tittle of the first step as follows: Start with the decision of the (non-empty) set of organizations (can be 1 or more) that will be using the Fabric network and which orgs use which channels.  I am confident you know how to abbreviate that.   I prefer to go step by step with these suggestions.  I believe the consultation of orgs to work together in Fabric is directly coupled with the decision which orgs use which channel. Of course the initial configuration can "elegantly" updated later (in a later release of Fabric).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Here are my notes from the meeting with Gari and Chris:  Customers want to know how to deploy an e2e fabric solution, using the fabric CA client to generate their certs.  How to set things up?  How to modify the network?  Describe `here are the things you need to do...` - * What info do you need and how do you get it? * You need an ordering service then you Stand up peers that may or may not be connected. How to set it up incrementally? * Where is the ordering service, how do I set up the ordering service? How to bring it up? *  How do I create the genesis block?  * When you setup a peer/here are things you need to know to setup a peer * Now that I have a remote peer, what can I do with it? * Where am I connecting it to - an anchor peer in another org? What info do you need to connect it.  * How do I setup an anchor peer * If you want to use TLS, what do you need to do? How to get the TLS cert? * How do you configure peers and get them to work together? * How do I create a channel? * What info do I need from the orgs (msps) * How to use Join channel api on the peer? * How to fetch the genesis block? * How to install & instantiate chaincode? * How to use the fabric-ca vs embed own cryptographic material externally * Guidance on setup for HA * What monitoring do I need to do?Here’s the processes you need to be monitoring. Here’s your log files….. * There’s a network running over here - how do I connect to that network? * We support Kafka - recommended config is: Min 4 Kafka brokers, replica config of 3. Get the Orderer config info from your kafka cluster * Message hub - Kafka as a service in blue mix - ibm event streams = message hub for icp - need to document - use this for 6 months and then switch over to RAFT  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~knagware9  You are exactly correct.  The process overview has been published here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment_guide_overview.html We are in the process of writing following topics which address the deployment considerations and steps in more detail.  In fact we've already started 2 of them here: There is a new tutorial  on deploying smart contracts : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/666 Deploying a CA: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/764  Coming soon: - Create a Channel - Deploy a peer - Deploy an ordering service  We welcome your feedback and suggestions!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA TODO * Planning for an orderer * Settings checklist * Deployment tutorial(s) ** Tutorial I: Deploy a  3 or 5  node ordering service *** OSN1 **** Generate certs and MSPs **** Generate system channel genesis block (configtxgen) **** Edit orderer.yaml **** Start orderer with genesis block *** Do we want to mention here – Create application channel ? *** OSN(n) (one node at a time!) **** Generate certs and MSPs **** Add new node to the Raft consenter set in configtx.yaml (system channel?) ***** Host: raft1.example.com Port: 7050 ***** ClientTLSCert: path/to/ClientTLSCert1 ***** ServerTLSCert: path/to/ServerTLSCert1 **** Edit orderer.yaml **** Start orderer with genesis block *** Add new OSN to to existing application channel **** *Add the TLS certificates* of the new node to the application channel through a channel configuration update transaction. Note: the new node must be added to the system channel before being added to one or more application channels. **** *Fetch the latest config block* of the system channel from an orderer node that’s part of the system channel. **** *Ensure that the node that will be added is part of the system channel* by checking that the config block that was fetched includes the certificate of (soon to be) added node. **** *Start the new Raft node* with the path to the config block in the {{General.BootstrapFile}} configuration parameter. **** *Wait for the Raft node to replicate the blocks* from existing nodes for all channels its certificates have been added to. After this step has been completed, the node begins servicing the channel. **** *Add the endpoint* of the newly added Raft node to the channel configuration of all channels. ** Tutorial II (FUTURE) add a Raft ordering node from another organization  ></body> </Action>

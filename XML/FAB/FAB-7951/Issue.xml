CDATA Policies that control replication factors for a collection and organization. The network should proactively redistribute data according to the desired balance of durability and scalability. For example, allow for: * Minimum number of peers that should contain a data element to mitigate against reduction inÂ durability when peer fails. * Maximum number of peers that should contain a data element to enable scaling of larger collections.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA -The goroutine that performs a write might not finish in time and the test goroutine might finish before it - which would cleanup the ledger while the write is being performed - thus resulting in a panic.-  Â   This test checks a specific concurrent execution path that resulted in a deadlock, but now after it is fixed, it makes no sense to keep this test anymore in CI.  ></description> </Issue>

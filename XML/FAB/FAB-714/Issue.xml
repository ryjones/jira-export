CDATA Define a daily (6-8 hrs?) automation test suite. This could be run daily with the latest successfully built images (which passed unit tests and behave, per existing guidelines for code submissions). This will include a few tests for functionality and APIs in each test area. (Another epic 516 will handle actually running and displaying results.)  Daily Test Suite: (up to 22 hrs; jenkins could use a few parallel machines) *                 GO SDK - Consensus CAT*                 (uses REST) scott *                 GO SDK - Ledger LST*                    (uses REST) scott *                 GO SDK - Concurrency/Ledger             (uses REST) scott/nishi *                 Node.js Concurrency with Auction        (uses Node) dongming *                 Complex Transactions with Auction       (uses Node) nishi *                 Performance engine Baseline tests       (uses Node) dongming   ></description> </Issue>

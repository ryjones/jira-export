CDATA Application developers often forget to appropriately reuse or release resources. In the case of fabric, if an application does not reuse gRPC connections, we are subject to some side effects. In particular, performance will suffer because the client needs to establish a new connection to the server and another TLS handshake occurs. Second, client side ephemeral ports can become exhausted. Third, the server can experience pressure on memory and file descriptor resources.  By surfacing information about the number of active connections, operators can observe unbounded growth in connections and use that to determine an appropriate course of action.  The start and end of a connection can currently be determined by implementing the `grpc.StatsHandler` interface and configuring it as a `grpc.DialOption` or `grpc.ServerOption`.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hello there!     I'm interested in helping develop the required software modules to make Python chaincode a reality. I've been investigating the issues and I haven't seen anything on the matter. The only related thing I spotted is the Python SDK but I don't think that covers it.     Can someone point me to the right direction? Is there any issue or message board where this is being discussed? And if there is not a project of this kind in progress already, how can I go about getting it started? Who should I talk to / where can I find the development guidelines?     Thank you! :)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The example for the end to end Getting Started scenario should allow CouchDB and the peer to be configured with CouchDB username and password.  The proposed change to docker-compose-couch.yaml would allow admin usernames and passwords to be added for couchdb and peer docker images.    All parameters added to the script are left uninitialized.  This allows the script to run "as is" and the CouchDB containers are created in "admin party" mode.  If the new variables are populated, the CouchDB containers and peers are created with usernames and passwords.  ></description> </Issue>

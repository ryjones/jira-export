CDATA Currently the Registrar.newChains() copies the chains map to a new one, supposedly to allow concurrent reads on the map while a chain is created. This is redundant because the newChain takes rwmutex.Lock(), which blocks reads.  It is enough to just create the chain and insert it to the map.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The code from 2005 is ready to be tested (the only TODO issue in epic 2005 is add 1 missing paragraph to the documentation).  In fact, it was already tested by running e2e demo and also during the integration with Java client-sdk.  This commit adds idemix to the e2e demo:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15707/      This commit (merged) allows to support local idemix MSP for go CLI: This change set enables local MSP support for the idemix MSP type. A new core.yaml option (localMspType) is used to determine the MSP type. The default is 'bccsp', but it can be set to 'idemix' to support idemix:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14541/20  ></body> </Action>

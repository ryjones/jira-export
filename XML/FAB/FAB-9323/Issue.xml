CDATA The existing fabric-sample script in CI only compatible for CI environment which executes default channel, custom channel, couchdb, eyfn tests, nodejs chaincode etc.. But the developers would like to execute these tests before they push changes to CI environment. It would be good to create a single point of script which is compatible to a developer to run on his machine and on CI environment.  Let's start this with fabric-samples and the same has to continue in fabric-sdk-node and fabric-sdk-java  ></description> </Issue>

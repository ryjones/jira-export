CDATA The current event framework found in fabric/events registers clients for events at the peer level and not at the channel level. This means that a client receives all events from the peer (that they are interested in). Adding ACL checks to this framework in addition to being unwieldy would also create a processing overhead, as we'd have to cycle through every client for every event whether they are interested in the channel or not.  A better approach would be to have clients register on events on a channel basis. While this could be done by extending the event framework, adding a channel level context  with ACL support on the peer wide framework is clugy.  A new channel service could be implemented on the peer endpoint to prepare for future ACL on events. A client would register with a peer for events from a specific channel. ACL policies will then determine if the client should be given access to events (and which type of events).  ></description> </Issue>

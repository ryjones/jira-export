CDATA I'm having some weird issues with peers, when one of them restarts. Once one of the peers restarts other peers start to open extra connections to it and at some point they reach the limit of connections fails and get restarted. The more peer gets restarted, the more connections are being opened to it by other peers. Also after restart peer starts opening connections to itself.  Reproducible on versions: 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3  Haven't tried on versions lover then 1.4.1.  ></description> </Issue>

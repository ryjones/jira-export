CDATA Currently, PTE uses the orderer defined in ordererID in the Service Credentials File for all transactions. This is less flexibility of load balance in sending transactions to all orderers.  This task provides a method, round robin, to achieve better load balance in orderer transactions.  Current method:  User defines the orderer to be used for all transaction in *ordererID* in the PTE Service Credentials file for each org.  The defined orderer must be included in the orderer list in the same file.  Proposed method:  PTE will supply two methods of orderer selection: # UserDefined: same as current method, i.e. user defines the orderer to be used for all transactions for each org in the Service Credentials file # RoundRobin: PTE will assign an orderer from the orderer list defined in the Service Credentials File in a round robin fashion to each thread for all transactions in the thread.  Note that the orderer list should only include the orderers to participate in the transactions.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to use a fit for purpose library to generate a configuration update that revokes a certificate issued by my organization's MSP.

This should result in a configuration update that appropriately modifies the {{revocation_list}} attribute of {{FabricMSPConfig}}.  ></description> </Issue>

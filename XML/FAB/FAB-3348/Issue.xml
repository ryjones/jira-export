CDATA Chaincode images may become stale and may not match fabric runtime images. Cleaning of chaincode images will take care of this but for debugging and servicing, it is important to know if that is necessary.   Version information should be passed to the chaincode at the time of building it so the chaincode can log it.  ></description> </Issue>

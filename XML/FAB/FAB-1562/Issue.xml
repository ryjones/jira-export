CDATA Below is the plan to perform end-to-end test for every component (peer, orderer, cop, node sdk):  Create a job and it should trigger every time when there is a commit merged in Fabric (master branch), fabric-cop and fabric-sdk-node. CI job has to pull the latest commits/or leverage the existing docker images from each repository and perform unit-tests and build images if required.  2nd step: Pull latest node-sdk code and spinup docker network using above images.  After network is started, perform end-to-end test and publish images to hyperledger docker hub  to publish these images we should have test docker repositories:  Need below repositories in docker hub to publish images after successful end-to-end tests.  fabric-dev-peer, fabric-dev-orderer, fabric-dev-ccenv,  fabric-dev-javaenv,  fabric-dev-cop  please remove fabric-dev-images repository  ></description> </Issue>

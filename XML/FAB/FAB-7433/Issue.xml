CDATA Currently, fabric will check the endorsement policy for every namespace that is being written to by a transaction. This means that if a transaction only reads from a namespace (i.e. the rwset is present for the namespace but no writes are there), the peer will skip the validation of the endorsement policy. The rationale is to permit a group of peers to perform read-only cc2cc invocations for a chaincode for which they couldn't generate a valid endorsement set.  However this might not be desirable, and we might want to * either change this behaviour (i.e. force endorsement policy checks for read-only invocations too) * or introduce a new notion of read-only endorsement policy  This FABÂ should be used to form consensus around either of these options (or new ones);  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It's not possible to use the provided bootstrap.sh to e.g. only show help, e.g. download some subset of images, binaries or samples.     1.2: grep '\d' does not work-as-intended on Debian (Linux), the arguments are thus excluded, the shift doesn't occur and so getopts doesn't see flags.   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/release-1.2/scripts/bootstrap.sh   master: IIUC swallows flags during the arguments assignment and shifting   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh   Propose: * Hackier – ' 0-9 ' or perhaps something more closely representative of the version types * Better(er) – while it would be a breaking change, consider making everything a flag  Follow-up:  If I put the flags before the arguments, 1.2 appears to work. So, in this case, it could be that only the help is wrong and should read:  {{bootstrap.sh  -d -s -b  <version>   <ca_version>   <thirdparty_version> }}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA (This can be thought of as a quasi-alternative to the proposal identified in FAB-6042.)  Similar to how we have the standard Readers/Writers/Admins policies under "/Channel/Applications/Policies", we introduce a new policy – let's call it "Instantiation". (A sensible default for it would be the majority of channel Admins.)  Instantiating chaincode "foo" begins with a proposal and works like the typical endorsement flow; once you have collected enough proposal responses to satisfy the "Instantiation" policy, you collect them into a transaction and broadcast this to the network via the ordering service.  This means that at any point in time, chaincode instantiation is defined by a single policy per channel; if participants wish to modify the policy, they just have to modify the value corresponding to "/Channel/Applications/Policies/Instantiation".  ></description> </Issue>

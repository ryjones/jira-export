CDATA The last segment of the import path should be the name of the package that's being imported. Either the folder (deliverservice) is incorrectly named or the package (deliverclient) is. Either way, something needs to change and all referencing code updated.  It's generally confusing to have an import of 'foo' only to have the exported symbols in the 'bar' package.  ></description> </Issue>

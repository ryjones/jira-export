CDATA Based on the final discussion:  - Split the value write and metadata write in separate protobuf messages so that the existing event listeners do not get impacted by the presence of metadata write message  - Allow only full metadata write in the ledger APIs and defer the support of delta updates to the the metadata when we need that in future. However, allow the support of setting the value and the metadata independently.  ></description> </Issue>

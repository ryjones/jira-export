CDATA https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/job/fabric-verify-integration-tests-x86_64/5076/consoleFull  In a cluster of two nodes, with ElectionTick == 10x HeartbeatTick, the probability of vote split (two nodes start the election at the same time) is 10/10*10 = 10%  with slow heartbeat interval introduced in  this CR|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/28918 , period of leaderless is prolonged for at least 5s every time vote split happens.  and our peer cli timeout is not very lenient (even increased to 10s in the CR aforementioned). the chance for this test to fail is 1%  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Given the explicit usage of the GOPATH variable in some of the Fabric support scripts, it should be strongly emphasized in the documentation that that environment variable needs to be set in a very specific way: * It _must_ be set and exported, even if one is using Go's default directory of ~/go, and * It can contain only a _single_ directory, not the more general, colon-separated list of directories.  Short of refactoring the support scripts, the simplest solution is to add a warning about this in the documentation.  ></description> </Issue>

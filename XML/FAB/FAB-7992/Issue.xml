CDATA In Reconfiguring Your First Network, the document has incorrect instruction about relaunching cli container.  According to the instruction described in fabric/docs/source/channel_update.rst, ``docker start cli`` is executed to relaunch cli container, which is configured in Bring Your First Network. However, cli container fails to relaunch with the following error messages.  {noformat}  $ docker start cli $ docker logs cli   / ___|  |_   _|    / \    |  _ \  |_   _| \___ \    | |     / _ \   | |_) |   | | ___) |   | |    / ___ \  |  _ <    | | |____/    |_|   /_/   \_\ |_| \_\   |_|  Build your first network (BYFN) end-to-end test  Channel name : mychannel Creating channel... (snip) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Channel creation failed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ========= ERROR !!! FAILED to execute End-2-End Scenario =========== {noformat}  This error happens because a script building fabric network is called when starting cli container.  To use cli container for manual work in reconfiguring fabric network, this script should not be executed. To fix this problem, the script should be commented out in docker-compose-cli.yaml. After that, cli container should be relaunched to reflect this change.   ></description> </Issue>

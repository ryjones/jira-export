CDATA As per  Matthew Sykes|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/owner:sykesmat%2540us.ibm.com+status:open  this job has been disabled for now but it's still in production Jenkins. Observed inconsistency test results after enable this job.  OnceÂ  ~sykesm  approves will enable this job in production.  Note: The Integration test job will not use "make integration-test" target as it will build ccenv image but the fabric build flow will push images from build job and pull these images from nexus in the downstream jobs. So, the IntegrationTest job pull the images and execute go test ./... from integration directory.  ~latitiah  ^^  ></body> </Action>

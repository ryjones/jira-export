CDATA A request is made using the handleGetStateByRange, the result set from this request is exactly 100 elements, and the peer returns those 100 elements but it also sets the has_more flag to true. The result is sent back to the chaincode which sees that the has_more flag is set to true and then makes another call via handleQueryStateNext, however there aren't any more elements and the peers returns a completely empty response, not even a response with zero elements which at least might be a more reasonable thing to expect. This can be recreated using any multiple of 100. The peer should not set the has_more flag for a range result set when there isn't more data to return.   See https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8115 as it directly affects the node.js shim  ></description> </Issue>

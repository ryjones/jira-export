CDATA Because the underlying ledger implementation streams the results, it is not possible to 'peek' ahead and see if there are more results. When the final number of results is not a multiple of 100 (100 is the max number of results returned in a QueryResponse), the HasNext flag will need to continue returning {{true}} because we cannot tell if we are done without `peeking` ahead.  As a solution, I am changing the implementation to return an empty array of results instead of nil for that final result.  ></body> </Action>

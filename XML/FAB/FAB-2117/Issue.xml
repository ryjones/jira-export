CDATA There are three stories linked to this epic and associated with the items above. 1.  Creating an effective splash page.   If you go into: https://www.corda.net/.   They have some really great high level information that is easy to follow.   - this is critical as it outlines all the writing that needs done. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2115  2. Develop the technology to display the information.  I can see for the Documentation tab they dive into Sphinx.  The pages are built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read The Doc (RTD). Our CI environment already uses RTD but not Sphinx.  Ramesh is working converting our RTD to Sphinx.  There is actually a conversion he is experimenting with for the doc formats.    The general look and feel of the main page (www.corda.net) -- it would be great to get input from some of the UX experts on what the options are to enhance the experience. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2111  3.   Writing the content.  Once everyone agrees on item 1.  Now assignments can be assigned.  Some the documents should have a writer and a technical contact that work jointly.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2116   ></description> </Issue>

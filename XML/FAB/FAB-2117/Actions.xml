CDATA for #1 a github page should suffice. We need someone with html/css design skills to pull together a page that is not IBM branded in any way, but could introduce a Fabric logo and like Corda simple UX to getting the code, docs and links to chat, stack-overflow, and so forth.  #2 I am unconvinced of an immediate need to change the style. However, we do need to get to a concise TOC and page organization.  #3 is MOST important. I have said that the devs should be writing and ID folk cleaning up the grammar etc and publishing the CRs as quickly as we can. Most important is HOW TO USE. Second comes stuff like high-level arch, capabilities, etc. though that is also important. It is more important that when we make code available that people can use without getting frustrated. Frustrated devs will just leave and not come back. We cannot afford this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA # Agree, in an ideal world all doc topics (Jira Issues) would have a writer assigned and a technical contact assigned. Currently ID adds multiple "Reviewers" to our CRs, who may or may not also be "Maintainers" (who can vote). # The current TOC is too large/expanded, in part, because some files are very large, with a number of sub-headings within a single .md (markdown) file. Splitting these files into multiple parent/child .md files is likely to improve the current TOC experience, because the subtopics would then only display (presumably) once the parent topic is clicked on in the TOC. # Not opposed to moving to Sphinx, but we went down this road before and decided on RTD - and the free plan that it provides with github account. RTD is Sphinx-like but doesn't actually use Sphinx - i.e. need to identify the benefits to moving to Sphinx proper. One such benefit is a "vanity" URL - whatever we want basically, whereas RTD requires the "readthedocs" string in the URL: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ... Another is potentially more control over the TOC display/colors etc., whereas RTD forces a "theme" which we aligned with Intelledger last year (http://intelledger.github.io/). Intelledger doc does employ Sphinx proper, if I recall. # All of this is done under the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric Community umbrella, which has its own processes, which we are complying with. # Splash page - Notice that the splash page for Corda is for all of Corda, not just Corda documentation.  ></body> </Action>

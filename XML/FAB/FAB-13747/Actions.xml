CDATA I actually refused to fix this for any container other than fabric-tools.  I don't understand why we are using the peer container to run bash commands.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are a good number of tests that are executed using the cli environment. The images are not being misused, but actually calling commands that are built into the images. We don't always use an SDK during execution - as there is a CLI interface for the peer, we should be able to use and test it.  This is a valid issue as bash is something that was supported and it is no longer supported with this latest update. Valid, fabric-based commands are being executed with these images - we are not misusing them.  As long as we have a CLI interface for the peers, we should make sure that our users are able to actually use that interface effectively. If there is a reason to not include or to block the use of bash, please state the thought(s) behind that, don't assume anyone is doing something wrong. In certain instances, there are commands that are executed before the 'peer node start' command (such as fabric-ca-client, for example).  I'm all for cutting down the extra cruft from the images, but we should be careful to not cut out useful functionality.  I'm not against using sh. If the decision is to support sh and ash, but not bash, I think it's worth stating why. Personally, I think that using bash with the CLI is better, but I am open to hearing arguments against it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, I've re-opened to await response from  ~mastersingh24   Minimally we would need a release note explaining that bash is no longer available in v2.0 and to use ash or sh instead. I've flagged as Release Note Required.  ></body> </Action>

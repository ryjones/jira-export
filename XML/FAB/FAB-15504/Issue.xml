However, any time these calls are being made, they are done so in a context where the config has already been validated to contain the correct components, so the result is almost always a panic if the sentinel returns false.  The API should simply be updated to remove the sentinel and assume that it is always populated." priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-05-21 16:51:33.0" updated="2019-05-21 16:51:49.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="52930"/>

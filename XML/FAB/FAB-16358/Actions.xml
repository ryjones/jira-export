CDATA  ~chris.elder  Can you point to the CouchDB doc recommendations related to this (I think you mentioned a recent doc change) and to the upcoming change in future CouchDB versions?  I see at https://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/intro/security.html#authentication-database that security object doesn't seem to be needed for _users database since it is already secured by default. How about the other two databases? Are they secured by default?  Also, will there be any issues for existing peer/couchdb instances that already have the security object set, when they upgrade to a future version of CouchDB?  ></body> </Action>

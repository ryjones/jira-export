The existing channel config at key resourcesconfigtx.CHANNEL_CONFIG_KEY may not have it&apos;s content saved in a deterministic order, due to maps not getting saved in a deterministic order during protobufÂ  marshaling. One approach is to take the Config directly from the ConfigEnvelope as produced by orderer, without unmarshaling and re-marshaling in each peer. Sample code for this approach can be found at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29766/." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2019-03-04 19:51:17.0" updated="2020-06-02 19:45:18.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:32:26.0" votes="0" watches="5" workflowId="49809"/>

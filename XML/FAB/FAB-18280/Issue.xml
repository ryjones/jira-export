CDATA The channel participation codebase has two places where the common FileRepo code is used to create a directory to store the resources needed for crash-fault tolerance of the join and remove operations. * https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/common/multichannel/registrar.go#L121 * https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/common/ledger/blockledger/fileledger/factory.go#L113  This task was spawned out of this review comment: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1952#discussion_r508964286   {noformat} "filerepo" seems almost uselessly vague.

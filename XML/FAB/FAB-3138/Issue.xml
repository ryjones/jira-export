CDATA The gossip network transports sensitive data that must not be seen by clients. Rogue clients could also introduce other attacks if they can impersonate being a peer. Clients must be considered less trusted than peers (also see FAB-3134).   There needs to be a mechanism to validate that an entity is allowed to join the gossip network. This means, for example, that the entity is part of a valid organization, holds a certificate from a valid root, *and has been given authorization to be a peer*. The last part is important because clients are also given certificates.  p.s., I assume other peer cases are covered by config txn (e.g., anchorPeer, endorser policy)? I'm having trouble locating the configuration for the normal peer (as described above).  Also can we confirm that the anchorPeer in the config txn has a relationship to their certificate that is being validated?  ></description> </Issue>

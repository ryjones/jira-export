CDATA Hi, security experts,  Not sure the following is a security bug, but I believe it may produce an attack on the peer nodes system, and affect other users.  Currently, we do not check the user chaincode's name when do install/instantiate.  This may result in potential mistakes by using same name of system chaincode.  When doing further user chaincode invoke, peer may believe it's a call to system chaincode (by simply checking its name in the system chaincode list), and will lead to uncontrolable privilege leakage.  If this is thought not a security bug, then I will create an open jira task and fix it.  Please help advice.  Thanks!  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Install will allow one to install a chaincode with the same name as a system chaincode but instantiation of that chaincode will not work.   install example02 with name lscc {code:java} CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=192.168.1.97:7051 peer chaincode install -n lscc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -v 0 {code}  Instantiate above lscc will fail with error {code:java} CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=192.168.1.97:7051 peer chaincode instantiate -n lscc -v 0 -C myc -c '{"Args": "init","a","100","b","200" }'  Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = attempting to deploy a system chaincode lscc/myc {code}  In other words, though one can install a chaincode with the same name as a system chaincode, it cannot not be instantiated - its just "dead" code.  So the statement _Currently, we do not check the user chaincode's name when do install/-instantiate-._ is not totally accurate (strikethru instantiate).  Its not a severe security issue (unless I'm missing something in the above analysis).... however, it _would_ be nice to check for name collision with system chaincodes and prevent install.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Pasting in a Rocket Chat thread from Elli * elli-androulaki 11:01 AM hi *  I transferred the message to Angelo Ale, and Mathias and we are looking into potential problems for this one. *   elli-androulaki 11:29 AM Ok, so it seems there is no security breach because of this, but we need to prevent cc-s installation/instantiation with same names as scc-s it to avoid confusion.  The only potential problem Angelo and I detected while looking into this is that RSCC invocation has not completed. Essentially one can change RSCC state without being authorised to do so. This is something that Angelo will take care of. *  This does not impact v1, but only v1.1-alpha  ></body> </Action>

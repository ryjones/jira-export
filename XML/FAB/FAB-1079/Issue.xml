CDATA As an owner of a peer on the BC network, I need the ability to upgrade the peer if there is a change in the protocol without loss of data.   With lifecycle chaincode, I can upgrade the chaincode. I also have the ability to apply patches/fixes if it does not apply to the protocol change itself via the SCC. Eventually I will have to accommodate this sort of change, in case there is a security vulnerability or something else that requires a major alteration.   ></description> </Issue>

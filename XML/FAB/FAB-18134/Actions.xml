Then restart docker; clear all old docker state.  After that my install chain code operation works without error.     This should be noted in the tutorial documentation as a warning for Mac users.  the gRPC fuse option is probably the default setting in recent versions. HLF 2.2 is not able to handle this setting.    ></body> </Action>

But I don't know how to update. Try to restart the channel and repeat the operation, lifecycle chaincode install runs successfully. Although I don't know the mechanism, it is always good for it to run successfully.  ></body> </Action>

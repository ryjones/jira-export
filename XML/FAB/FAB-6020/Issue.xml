CDATA As the project attempts to move to a more consistent release schedule (current proposal is every 3 months), there will be features which will not be completed in a single release cycle.  It is not uncommon, however, for projects to provide builds with experimental features for those who wish to stay on the bleeding edge.    There are a couple of ways to do this:  1) Use feature flags to enable/disable features at runtime 2) Use Go build tags to optionally compile with experimental features.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA A few golang references for connection profile usage:  -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/internal/peer/common/networkconfig.go  has the network config struct that the peer CLI reads a connection profile into.  -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/internal/peer/lifecycle/chaincode/testdata/connectionprofile.yaml  is an example of a valid connection profile.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="69648" issue="45562" author="denyeart" type="comment" body="This sounds like a utility that an operator may want to implement using the existing Fabric config library. I wouldn&apos;t expect the Fabric project to actually deliver such a utility. Therefore I&apos;ll close the Jira issue for now. If there are specific gaps in Fabric project that need to be filled in order to create such a utility (e.g. extensions to the config library), then we can open separate Jira items for those." created="2020-07-08 15:09:18.0" updateauthor="denyeart" updated="2020-07-08 15:09:18.0"/>

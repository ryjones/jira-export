CDATA Currently, the token ledger namespace is set to *tms*. To goal of this story is to make it more readable and rename it to *fabtoken*.  The system must ensure that no chaincode can be deployed with that name.  LSCC is responsible to check if a chaincode name is valid or not.   Ideas: # -add chaincode.name == "fabtoken" to lscc. Would be better to access const namespace located in token.namespace but this introduces an import to lscc. Bad idea.- # -More general, add a method like isReservedName(chaincode.name)bool that is called when a new chaincode is deployed. lscc can maintain a list of reserved chaincode names.-  # -We can introduce a system chaincode called fabtoken. Maybe this sys chaincode can also be used to enable/disable token functionality at a peer?!- # Instead of using "fabtoken" we can use an invalid chaincode name, such as "_fabtoken". That way we do not get a namespace conflict, however, maybe this violates namespace conventions     Solution: Use reserved namespace FAB-11308. Reserved namespaces are denoted with "_" prefix, for example "_lifecycle". See  FAB-13850|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28931/   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~kchristidis   ~sanchezl  I agree that something like Zookeeper's ruok command would be better.  In addition, I would propose something a little more detailed however since I'm not really sure what exactly ruok checks and would have the same concern on the orderer.  I'm thinking of an ruok with a bit more detail than "imok".  I'm making this up, but something like: Status: Good (the "imok" part), and maybe the number of orderers it sees, number of channels it's aware of, and maybe 1-2 other things you guys think are key information to check the health of an orderer without giving away any information we wouldn't want to.  Zookeeper has a few more 4 letter status codes that give a bit more info for reference.     Ideally, I'd propose both a standard yes/no status check that we could use for metrics type reporting..which is my view of what ruok/imok could do, but with a 1/0 or http 200/400 return code.  Then a more detailed one we could hit for more detail if the standard check failed.  You could of course combine these into one check that returns more info and uses the status code of 0/1 or 200/400 to determine if status is good/bad.     Finally, any such check would need to be really low cost of course.  The type of thing that could be hit every minute or so and not cause performance issues.     ></body> </Action>

I think only admins should be able to do non-channel operations on service discovery, and that the admin can specify in the membership query whether it only wants to know about peers in its own org or not.   I also think that since this is the admin that is querying, the service discovery can return to it the private endpoints of the peers (not only the external ones) of its org -  ~mastersingh24  ,  ~C0rWin  , does that make sense?    ~bstasyszyn  - any other special requests? (what color, shape, etc.)   ></body> </Action>

CDATA   {quote}Not sure, why this query should be restricted to admins only? {quote} Because I can't think of a use case where an organization user would want to know the peers of its org, unless he/she wants to do something with them in an administrative context, other than having a monitoring application for your org, but - i don't think that's a good enough reason not to just use an admin certificate in the monitoring app.     I think I can just make it configurable locally in the core.yaml, and put it as admin only by default, and the org can decide to override it to let also non-admin users to query.  How does that sound?  ></body> </Action>

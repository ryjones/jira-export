CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API, I would like to be able to create genesis blocks for system channels. As a reminder, system channel genesis block does not create an application group and instead only fills the channel config group with an orderer and consortiums group. Whether we choose to combine this function with application channel creation like what was done in the original configtx encoder, or we choose to split them into separate API functions is up to the implementer.  Â   *Acceptance*  I can call a function to create a system channel genesis block. There should be a new example added that demonstrates this behavior.  ></description> </Issue>

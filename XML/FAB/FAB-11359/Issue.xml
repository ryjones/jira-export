CDATA *Acceptance*: A simulated client submits to the prover peer a request to list its tokens. Peer responds with the list of tokens that the requestor owns as indicated by the TMS pool state. If this is a memory-based pool, then we expect that the response depends on the content of the pool. If this is a ledger based pool, then the peer is expected to respond with the list of tokens owned by the requestor as shown in ledger state.      We aim to offer a  TMS system list tokens owned by a specific user considering a mockup ledger.   ></description> </Issue>

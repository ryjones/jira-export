CDATA The peer-ledger is saved in the file named `blockfile_XXXXX`. In the event that the file become unwritable (e.g. accidentally deleted by some other process), none of the subsequent transactions result in any error/warning log even though the the TXs are not being written in the file anymore.  Expectation: if peer fails to record the TXs in the ledger, it indicates the error somehow, possiblyÂ via the logs. The network operators need to be made aware of the error and if any manual recovery actions are necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

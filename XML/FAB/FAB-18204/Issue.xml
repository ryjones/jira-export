CDATA The coupling between the multichannel.Registrar and the etcdraft.Consenter is currently established using function pointers. Convert that pattern to an interface that captures the functions the etcdraft.Consenter needs from the Registrar.  This will enhance readability, ease maintenance, and allow the use of mocks for testing.  Moreover, the etcdraft package imports the multichannel package.  This prevents the multichannel package from using the onboarding  and cluster packages, which depend on etcdraft. Decoupling that dependency is one of the benefits of this refactoring.   ></description> </Issue>

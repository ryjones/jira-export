CDATA The channel participation API enables joining an application channel from a genesis block (i.e. there is no system channel and no system channel genesis block). The configtx library should be enhanced to provide a way to create one. An application channel genesis block should consist of the Orderer and Application sections (the Consortiums section only applies to system channel configuration and should not be included).  Â   Acceptance: I can call function "NewApplicationChannelGenesisBlock" with a channel config and channel ID and it returns a genesis block (i.e. block with block number 0) that can be used to create a channel using an OSN that does not have a system channel.  ></description> </Issue>

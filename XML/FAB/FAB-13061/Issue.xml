CDATA We have a number of places (at least some in the chaincode package and one in ledger) where we join the chaincode name and version together with a colon to use as the value of a chaincode label.  Given we want consistency in the label names and values, it probably makes sense to create a function somewhere that does the conversion of a *pb.ChaincodeID to the format needed by metrics. Normally that would simply be a method on the object but, since the object is generated by protobuf, it's not the best idea; we certainly can't change the fmt.Stringer implementation of the object...  /cc  ~wlahti ,  ~skarim   ></description> </Issue>

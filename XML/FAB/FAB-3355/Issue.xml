CDATA We may want to consider extending our e2e flow to check the following:  a) Installation of various versions of a chaincode (with instantiation policies -  ~yacovm  suggested) b) Instantiation of chaincodes in various chains, attempts of instantiating twice on the same chain or more c) Application chaincode querying another application chaincode on the same chain d) Application chaincode invoking another application chaincode on the same chain e) Application chaincode querying another application chainocde on a different chain f) Application chaincode invoking a system chaincode (LSCC, QSCC, CSCC, ESCC, VSCC)  - on the same chain?  - on a separate chain? - chainless functions of theirs?  - while considering invoking each function separately(?) g) System chaincode invoking another system chaincode (?) h) Installing chaincodes with same name but different metadata on different peers, and attempting to instantiate and invoke afterwards these chaincodes on each of the peer.  i) Configuration updates of multiple components on a chain  j) others? Inviting  ~adc ,  ~ales ,  ~mne ,  ~yacovm ,  ~binhn ,  ~mastersingh24 ,  ~muralisr ,  ~bmos299  to comment on these or more additions are needed here (?)   ></description> </Issue>

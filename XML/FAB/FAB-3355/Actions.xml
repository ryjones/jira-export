CDATA A few points: * Access control tests that check that a certain operation with a given principal isn't allowed, are very fast to check in comparison to operations that succeed (instantiate that succeeds, install that succeeds, etc.) , hence they won't prolong much the total time of the e2e test if such tests would be added to it. * In my opinion, checking access control only in mock tests is risky. Especially since the implementations of the tests relies on many "Mock" code that might somehow be initialized in a different way in the execution in production, therefore rendering the test not accurate.  * We only use the same (single) instantiation policy in the e2e test... so there is nothing that checks if access control of that aspect works at all.   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="22912" issue="15948" author="bmos299" type="comment" body="Thanks for the suggestions.  The Quality team has created a folder structure hyperledger/fabric/test/regression/ which includes folders for daily, weekly, and release testing.  Many of the tests described above have been tested and will go into the daily folder and PRs are in an open state or about to be submitted with these automated tests.   All the tests suggested above can be evaluated to determine if they belong in the verify run and/or daily run.  The trade off is time vs coverage.  I&apos;ll assign to  ~2020Nishi  and have her work to create Jira&apos;s and make sure these security tests are covered.

CDATA Folks,      I am sure many user of the Fabric-Client and Fabric-CA-Client relies on the example code (Balance Transfer) to learn how to use the SDK.      Unfortunately, the example code is layered with lots of other non-sdk code which kind of distract from really understanding how to get the SDK to do things like: install, instantiate, invoke and query chaincodes.      May I suggest that you create very simple example, say something like a glorified database operation, connecting to a single peer that's all. Separate out the example, in three different files for each of the above mentioned operation. The example should focus on just showing the steps to do each operation, unlike the Balance Transfer example, which had codes dealing with switching between peers and thus making the code unnecessarily distracting when all we want to know are steps we need to write for each operation.  ></description> </Issue>

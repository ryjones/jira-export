CDATA h2. Steps to Reproduce: # Config Updated the orderer system channel with new orderer as consentor # Config Updated the application channel with new orderer as consentor # Fetched the latest config block from application channel (instead of the proper way, to get it from the orderer system channel) # Supplied fetched latest config block from application channel from earlier step to new orderer during its launch as genesis file # Observed pulling blocks for channel, and eventually a panic in the orderers  h2. Observed:  When on boarding a new orderer, misconfigured it by supplying the latest config block of application channel during its launch as genesis file instead of latest config block from orderer system channel, orderer was able to pull blocks on the application channel (presumably thinking it was the systemchannel) until the next latest config block on the channel. When it reached and processed that channel config update (from step 2), the orderers panicked.  h2. Expected:  We expect a rejection by the orderer when the wrong type of config block is used for an orderer genesis file, when launching an orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I have two organizations in my fabric network. Something in one of the organizations happened and all of its containers stopped. I tried to restart all the containers by using the command: docker start  container name/ID   All the containers started working except the ones that related to the chaincode (the ones that are created from images that are created when instantiating the chaincode). In my case one of these containers is named "dev-peer1.org2.example.com-mycc-v0".  When I run the command: docker start -ai dev-peer1.org2.example.com-mycc-v0  This error appears on the screen:     2018-09-03 07:38:57.505 UTC  shim  userChaincodeStreamGetter -> ERRO 001 x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "serial:275482415651089174706268299809265189231") error trying to connect to local peer github.com/balance/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim.userChaincodeStreamGetter /chaincode/input/src/github.com/balance/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/chaincode.go:111 github.com/balance/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim.Start /chaincode/input/src/github.com/balance/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/chaincode.go:150 main.main /chaincode/input/src/github.com/balance/balance.go:793 runtime.main /opt/go/src/runtime/proc.go:195 runtime.goexit /opt/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:2337 Error creating new Smart Contract: error trying to connect to local peer: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "serial:275482415651089174706268299809265189231")     What should I do to bring the stopped organization back to the network?  Is there any tutorial on how to bring back stopped organizations/peers and make sure that they're in sync with the rest of the network? How can I make sure that after restarting a stopped peer container its version of blockchain is not in conflict with the rest of the peers? Does this restarted peer fetch the missed blocks and sync with other peers automatically?  ></description> </Issue>

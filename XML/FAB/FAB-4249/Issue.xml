CDATA yPer attached Security scan report , following are occurances of  TLS option InsecureSkipVerify to be set to true  : # *fabric/gossip/comm/comm_impl.go (line 625)* # *fabric/gossip/comm/comm_impl.go* *(line 630).*  There are evidences of InsecureSkipVerify to be set to true in sbft module, but is not being reported as the module will be deleted very soon.**     After talking to  ~mastersingh24  , it was evident that the TLS module reported above is being used in Server context whereas the InsecureSkipVerify flag is being set in TLS client module.Based on above fact ,it seems innocuous , but we want clean scan report.  Based on above fact , following possibilities exist : # Separate out TLS Client and TLS server code with Client TLS config object and Server TLS config object . In the Client TLS config object , the InsecureSkipVerify should be set to false or # Set InsecureSkipVerify to false.  I prefer option 1.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the Contributions Welcome! section it would be nice if we provided class diagrams/overview on the code structure - see HyperLedger Fabric e-mail below:  https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2018-April/003353.html  Hello Everyone, I have started going through source code of fabric and followed the contribution guide to set up a dev environment along with other prerequisites like linux foundation ID. I have been able to understand little bit of code structure but going through all the code, my progress seems to be slow. It would be helpful if anyone can provide any documentation or class diagrams. Thanks Sushil Paneru  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the current code, we index only one transaction (the first one) with a txid. This is a rare scenario that we will encounter more than one transaction with same txid. However, this requires looking up in the index for the detection of duplicate Txid during commit path.  Instead, index all the transactions without looking for txids duplication. This requires the index key for a transaction to include blockNum/TranNum to make the key unique. Hence, a rebuild of index would be needed.  ></description> </Issue>

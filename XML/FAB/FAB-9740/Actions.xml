CDATA In FAB-9719 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21237/, we added steps to collect resource utilization data from the host (as well as saving container logs) after the test completes before the network is torn down. That may be sufficient.  However, if more timely data collection is still needed at the exact time of error such as a dropped grpc connection or NACKed message, then we could still pursue the suggested solution in this bug description.  ></body> </Action>

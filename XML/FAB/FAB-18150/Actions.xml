<Action id="71693" issue="45805" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="This pairs well with FAB-18152 and FAB-18147.  It _should_ be really easy to reinitialize the Raft state machine, after all, a node can &apos;leave&apos; and then &apos;rejoin&apos; a consenter set and this all works.  But, because of the way things are wired it&apos;s challenging.  When these other two are tackled, this issue should be taken into consideration." created="2021-04-16 19:29:50.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2021-04-16 19:29:50.0"/>

From the discussion on the CR:  {noformat} Jason Yellick Sep 9 11:46 PM Looking at the documentation here: https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure#DecoderConfig It looks like this brings some other potentially undesirable behavior, in particular: //   - negative numbers to overflowed uint values (base 10) //   - slice of maps to a merged map I'm personally a little torn.  It seems like the behavior is generally desirable, but also a little odd in some cases.  Thoughts? {noformat}   {noformat} Volodymyr Paprotski Sep 11 5:16 AM Interesting, didnt see that blurb before, thanks for the link, pretty useful. negative numbers.. don't have anything like that today (all positive like port address. Pin is treated like a string.) So I am not necessarily opposed to that interpretation.. Thats probably the This looks esoteric (until one needs it I suppose, when its very frustrating 'bug', but still appears a corner case. Am I wrong?) On other hand, not able to specify a bool in any way.. I guess the alternative is to write a custom parser? So, in my, non-maintainer opinion, i am ok with that interpretation.. {noformat}   ></body> </Action>

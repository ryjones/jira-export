CDATA Create a short (1-2 hrs?) automation test suite to execute tests that are submitted to community hyperledger fabric. This could serve as a preliminary smoke test, before kicking off longer test suites. This will include a few tests for basic functionality and APIs in each test area. (Another epic 516 will handle actually running and displaying results.)  When code is merged: # Run First: Smoke Test Suite (15 minutes maximum) *                 REST    API one-time tests, bring up network, deploy, invoke/query all 4 peers.  Also? Stop 2 peers to confirm network halts, restart 1 to confirm it resumes. Drive from Behave (Latitia) *                 node    API one-time tests, bring up network, deploy, invoke/query all 4 peers. (nishi) *                 Performance engine quick test: time for 1000 Tx (dongming)  # Run Second, if Smoke Test passes: make all Unit Tests: *                 same as today, includes all current and new Behave tests (Latitia), plus *                 all the Node UT being submitted this month (Allen, Janet)   ></description> </Issue>

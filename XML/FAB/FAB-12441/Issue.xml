Developers can package JSON index files with their chaincode to define indexes. However, what about defining views? CouchDB supports further control via the specification of a design document (http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/design.html). If Fabric exposed some of this functionally to developers, developers could create views to collate data together and create even better queries, for instance joins with views (https://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/ddocs/views/joins.html)." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-10-12 22:02:40.0" updated="2020-01-22 22:32:22.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:32:22.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="46052"/>

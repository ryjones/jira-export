CDATA  CI  - disable fabric-verify-s390x job and publish email to maintainers if the build fails on merge.  In the current process, we run fabric unit-tests on x86_64 and s390x platforms this is taking huge time and sometimes developers are no clue why the builds are failing on s390x machines and success on x86. As mentioned by @cbf disable unit-tests job for every verify and send the mail to maintainers if fabric-merge-s390x job fails.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Refer to Item 40 of tab "Behave Testcases" in shared google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741  Existing test 'integration/gossip/gossip_test.go It("solo network with 2 orgs, 2 peers each, should sync from the peer if no orderer available")' stops the 2nd peer of first org and both peers of 2nd org, sends TXs, and starts all again. Call this existing code = PartA.  For this testcase, we want to do something similar. The first difference is that we must configure the network to specify one leader and one non-leader in each org; that is, we will NOT use peer gossip leader election. Secondly, we must stop only the leader peer (likely peer0) of one organization. Leave the other 3 peers running, and send transactions to one of the peers in the other org. Start the stopped leader peer, and confirm it rejoins successfully; it should resume as leader and catch up its ledger.    ></description> </Issue>

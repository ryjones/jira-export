<Action id="49737" issue="33419" author="rickr" type="comment" body="From what I see described this is _working as designed._  The default is to check all eventing  peers on the channel for acknowledgement the transaction has been committed (via events)  . The application can also select which peers it would like to see complete -- or none at all.   Applications need to put on the future a time out.  If the future times out as opposed to being successful or in error, the application needs to determine what it needs to do to recover. It can just ignore it or query the specific peers it deems necessary/adequate to having committed the transaction." created="2018-09-01 20:33:26.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2018-09-01 20:33:26.0"/>

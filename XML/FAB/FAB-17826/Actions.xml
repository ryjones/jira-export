CDATA 200 and 404 are both acceptable and expected return codes. The metrics are simply telling you how many occurrences there were for each return code. CouchDB returns 404 if it tries to query a document and the document is not yet created in the database. The peer handles the 404 correctly depending on the scenario (e.g. it would return nil on a GetState() call). I'll close as working as expected.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="62903" issue="35110" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Update: we should test using 2.0 images, but continue using the 1_4_2 capabilities. The v2_0 capabilities would turn on the new lifecycle code, which would require enhancements to the PTE and Operator tools which are still in our backlog, FAB-16262. It is ok to use v1_4_2 caps because the only other things that require the 2_0 caps besides lifecycle are functional in nature and are not being tested in our system traffic tests. We will put this in backlog for now, but of course at some point in future we will update the tools and test with the v2_0 caps enabled." created="2019-08-14 20:51:06.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-08-14 20:51:06.0"/>

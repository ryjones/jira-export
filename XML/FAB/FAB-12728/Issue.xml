CDATA Change fabric-test frameworks (NL, and Behave, and PTE) to start networks with V2_0 capabilities for channel and orderer enabled by default. For now we can continue to use V1_4_2 for the application cap, since we need to continue to use the old lifecycle methods. This will allow the new features to work and to ensure the existing basic functionality works with the new capabilities enabled in the new release.  V1_4_3 channel capability is new, needed for NodeOUs. V2_0_0 application cap is for NodeOUs and tokens and new lifecycle methods - none of which we need to test currently in systests. Here is a link to the docs added for NodeOUs; https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/32235 We might need to also change config files in fabric-samples or for examples in fabric itself too. But I think it may already be done: refer toÂ `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#L78` and `FAB-16322: fabric-samples to V1_4_3 channel capability`.   ></description> </Issue>

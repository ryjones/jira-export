CDATA Test name: Performance test: endorsement policy Component: Performance test Description: performance endorsement policy with levelDB     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_cc Node JS, instantiated     transactions: 4 threads, each thread sends 750,000 invokes concurrently, total 3 millions          thread 1 sends to peer 1 of both org on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 2 sends to peer 1 of both org on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 3 sends to peer 1 of both org on channel 2, registers events for channel2          thread 4 sends to peer 1 of both org on channel 2, registers events for channel2     Network Topology: docker containers; 2 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels  Endorsement policy:   "endorsement": \{     "identities":           \{ "role": \{ "name": "peer", "mspId": "PeerOrg1" }},         \{ "role": \{ "name": "peer", "mspId": "PeerOrg2" }}       ,      "policy": \{           "2-of":    \{ "signed-by": 0 }  ,  \{ "signed-by": 1 }          } },  Event: channel service with block listener Client Driver: PTE Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error     each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies events received for every transaction it sent itself The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

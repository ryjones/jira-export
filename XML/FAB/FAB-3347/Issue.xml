CDATA Since we are working torwards an ability to change logging levels per components dynamically, this should start with WARN instead of INFO as the rest of the components.  Also- this affects the tests- some tests are running in parallel and are creating lots of "gossip instances" and the combined logging is too much for CI to handle and the tests time out.  ></description> </Issue>

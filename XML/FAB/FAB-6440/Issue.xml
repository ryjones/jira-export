CDATA Refer to  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1  and the new feature JIRA mentioned in the summary  FAB-5346 provides controls to manage each member's access to chaincode information.  Notes from chat channel:  We should read the attributes out of the ___ and use for member roles actions. We've mentioned previously that they are focused on ACL evaluation, and therefore even if there are changes to resource/policy configuration the ACL evaluation would still be relevant. I believe the ACL checks would be enabled regardless; what could be disabled/enabled would be rscc based resource/policy config - and if disabled then fall back to 1.0 permissions. The ACL calls will default to 1.0 behavior if RSCC is disabled OR if RSCC enabled and resources are not configured channel confi which is true (per Murali testing).  ></description> </Issue>

We would like to optimistically create a chain of normal blocks to pipeline block creation and consensus. Config blocks cannot allow pipelining since we need to re-validate all the messages upon a config change. We need to take care of discarding this optimistic chain of blocks if a diverging block is committed." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-10-09 14:10:42.0" updated="2018-12-06 11:01:02.0" resolutiondate="2018-12-03 11:45:25.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="45906"/>

CDATA This story needs more detail.  It might be possible to report more details of the leader status via the channel participation API, but the utility is questionable.  Ultimately, in an asynchronous system, no node can guarantee the current state of the cluster, and after reading from the API the state may immediately change.  Can you please elaborate more on the intended purpose of these extensions and re-open?  ></body> </Action>

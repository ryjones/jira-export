CDATA  ~denyeart  that's what I do too. I often wished we could use an ENV var to set *GenesisProfile: SampleSingleMSPSolo*.   I tried using SampleInsecureSolo a while back as it was the orderers default but it didn't work at that time with a user defined channel (ie, not "testchainid").   ~jyellick  what do you think of using SampleSingleMSPSolo as default ... or can we override via ENV so we don't have to change orderer.yaml ? Seems like a nice usability feature if the impact is not too much.  ></body> </Action>

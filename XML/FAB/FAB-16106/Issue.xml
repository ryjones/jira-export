CDATA The external launcher stuff currently operates in a build context in a temporary directory.  This works, but, it means that whenever the peer is shutdown, the temp directory 'leaks' and needs to be cleaned up manually.  Additionally, the next time the peer starts back up, it has to rebuild all of the build contexts, including rebuilding any source code.  Acceptance:  Starting a peer, invoking a chaincode built by an external builder, restarting the peer and invoking that same chaincode should work, and the 'build' command should only be invoked once.  ></description> </Issue>

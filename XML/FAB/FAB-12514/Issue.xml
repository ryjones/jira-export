CDATA In order to support existing users who use service credential json for executing PTE, we will need a conversion tool to convert PTE service credential jsons to connection profile.Â  As today, we have convert.js to convert connection profile to PTE service credential json.  This converter tool FAB-12514 must be completed before FAB-7138, which will change PTE to look for a connection profile instead of a Service Credentials File. Since PTE will not support both functions, 7138 will be a non-backward-compatible change. Therefore, this converter tool must be used to convert all the existing SCFiles under fabric-test/tools/PTE/ into connection profiles, and merge them into fabric-test/tools/PTE/ BEFORE 7138 is merged... so the automated CITests will be able to find connection profiles once we merge 7138.  Recommendation: PTE should not run this converter tool automatically, because we need to ensure all users create their own connection profiles. It is a one-time thing. Note: With the 7138 changeset, PTE should: * halt when it cannot find a connection profile * print instructions to the user to create a connection profile (and to place it in appropriate location for PTE to find it) * show an example in the PTE/SCFiles directory of equivalent SCFile and connection profile * explain where to find instructions how to run the converter tool - useful for those users that have their own SCFiles already For users that upgrade from earlier fabric releases and continue to run PTE tests, they would have to clone the newer fabric-test and PTE from 2.0 (or 1.4.2, if we put all this in release-1.4 too), run the converter to create connection profile from their SCFile, and only then could run PTE tests. Thus, this converter tool must be supported as long as the upgrades are supported. For example, if we support upgrades from 1.3 or 1.4 (which uses SCFile) to 2.0 (which requires connection profile), but not 1.4 to 3.0 then we could stop the support for the migration tool in 3.0 since it won't be needed (because any tests in 2.0 must use the connection profile). Also, if customers must upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0 before going to 2.1, for example, then we could end support for converter tool in 2.1.  ></description> </Issue>

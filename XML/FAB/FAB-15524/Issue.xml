CDATA FAB-14017 introduced the {{EnableV2_0Capabilities}} method in nwo. As defined, the method is not generalized enough to warrant its placement in that package.  The method needs to be modified to accept the instance of *common.Capabilities to set for the channel or a variadic list of capability strings. If this is not done, we'll have an Enable V14,V21,v22, etc method at some point.  I'd expect it to preserve the existing ModPolicy as well.  ></description> </Issue>

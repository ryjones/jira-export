CDATA The orderer configuration needs to be embedded within the raw ledger.  This is for two reasons:  1. The orderer service needs to be able to convey initial configuration and configuration changes to the peer service so that the peer knows how to properly validate the raw ledger being returned (this may be different per orderer implementation, and may as simple as verifying a public key, or as complicated as a PBFT f+1 out of N signatures or connections) 2. The orderer service must agree to an initial configuration as without a common initial configuration (and common points of time for changing the configuration) the correctness of the orderer service may not be guaranteed.  This will require coordination between the chaincode/ledger peer side for applying and interpreting the configuration changes, as well as the orderer side for generating, and agreeing upon such changes..  ></description> </Issue>

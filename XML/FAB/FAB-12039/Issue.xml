CDATA Currently fabric only allows private data to be deleted based on block height (BlockToLive). This is insufficient for use cases that need to address GDPR, specifying when data needs to be purged in real time.  Also, BlockToLive is prone to DoS attacks by adversaries that submit transactions with the goal of creating sufficient number of blocks to quickly exceed the BlockToLive of their victims.  ></description> </Issue>

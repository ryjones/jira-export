CDATA This go chaincode does not, what you would expect {code:java} APIstub.PutState("key",   byte("initial Value")) val, _ := APIstub.GetState("key") fmt.Println("value from ledger", string(val)){code} The putState is not applied immediately, but only after the transaction!  !image-2017-11-18-15-06-13-189.png!  Suggested Improvement: Stub should provide an intermediate layer to keep track of state modifications *within a transaction*. Such that {code:java} x = getState(key); x++  putState(key, x) y=getState(key){code} results in y = x+1 not x!  ></description> </Issue>

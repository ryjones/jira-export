CDATA There were no UT tests added with this fix. I am surprised this was merged into release v1.0.2 without any documented test coverage.   ~yacovm  - Could you describe for our customers the tests you performed after fixing this issue? (And, if there is any additional testing our team can do to ensure completeness of testing, let us know.)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA If you want to test it - my recommendation is simply using cryptogen and having 2 CA trees (orderer org tree and peer org tree) in the same organization - this would allow the peers and the orderers identify each other under the same org although having different root CAs.

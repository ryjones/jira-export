CDATA Refer to  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1  and the New Feature JIRA mentioned in the summary.  FAB-830 provides an encryption library that allows customers to encrypt sensitive data that a chaincode processes and updates. This provides another level of security for highly sensitive data.

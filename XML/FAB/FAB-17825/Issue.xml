CDATA In order to run performance regression, we need to have some representative networks for Fabric.  Not sure if these already exists, but if not, it would be nice to start with three network setups:     Small:  maybe like the one in Fab-17614,  * 2 orgs * 2 peers with CA's * 2 orderer nodes * 1 channel * 1 chaincode types  Medium:  * 5 orgs * 2 peers with CA's * 5 orderer nodes all belonging to the same org. * 5 channel * 1 chaincode types   Large: * 30 orgs * 2 peers with CA's * 10 orderer nodes, from different Orgs * 1 channel * 1 chaincode types     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The current PTE execution engine assumes that any organization user may trigger any transaction. But this assumption does not hold when chaincode is sensitive to organization names (or MSP IDs) and performs access control on that basis.  We need to add a feature whereby an appropriate user (signing identity) is selected for a given transaction (identified by function name) to ensure the success of that transaction.  The chaincode developer should be able to specify the access control policy as a mapping of chaincode function name to a list of organization MSP IDs. The PTE driver will load (or enroll) an appropriate user and associate it with the Fabric client handle used to invoke the transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

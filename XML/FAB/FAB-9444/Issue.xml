CDATA We have excellent diagrams that have been created to help illustrate conceptual information in the Key Concepts section of the Fabric documentation.  Going forward, we can add key symbols from these diagrams to the glossary to aid in visual consumption of terms as they appear throughout the documentation.  Items in the glossary tend to cover Blockchain processes and structures. Processes are less adaptable to icons such as we are proposing here, but structural elements (e.g. ledger)  fit very nicely and to some extent relationship elements (e.g. channel) do as well.  We are not actually inventing new icons in the glossary - we are using icons from existing merged diagrams, to unify the concepts.  Anthony has proposed a simple pattern to develop this out going forward:  1) In a new glossary folder, edit the .ppt and and the new symbol, in a small and large size.  2) Copy that image to a .png file named in the format glossary. icon_name .png  3) Include the image in the /glossary/glossary.rst file. It appears to the right of the text and can be sized small (50%) or large (100%) depending on the detail level inside the image.     Latest Documentation HERE: https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/77/html/glossary/glossary.html           ></description> </Issue>

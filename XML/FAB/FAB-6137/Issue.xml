CDATA In the earlier days of configuration, it was not entirely clear what configuration would look like, so the notion of configuration templates was invented.  This worked well to abstract the underlying implementation away from the consumers, but now that the configuration form has settled down, it provides an unnecessary complication that serves to obfuscate and make understanding of the configuration more challenging.  This CR adds a util function for directly generating the proto material necessary to construct a *cb.ConfigValue.  There are currently no consumers, but new ones will be added later in the change series.  ></description> </Issue>

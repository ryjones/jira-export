CDATA Build should be building the Node SDK API docs (generated by "typedoc" command) and publishing them such that they will be available online  This should be done on the v0.6 branch. the new project fabric-sdk-node has its own doc generation so this set up will need to be re-done for v1.0 later on. But that'll not be for another couple of months, so let's worry about publishing v0.6 now.  ></description> </Issue>

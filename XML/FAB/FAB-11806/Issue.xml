CDATA Once the pvtData of old blocks are committed to pvtStore, we need to check whether the stateDB needs to be updated. If so, we should commit the pvtData to the stateDB.  As a peer can fail after committing pvtData of old blocks, we might end up with a stateDB which is out of sync from the pvtStore. Hence, we need to implement a recovery mechanism.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There is some goofy cleanup of volumes going on in fabric-samples/first-network.  In particular, the compose is being downed removing volumes (but having no affect on the volumes), then other cleanup, then downed again remove the volumes  Most likely, we can fix all of this in eyfn.sh by including a --remove-orphans.  We likewise can probably cleanup the down process in byfn.sh by doing the same.  ></description> </Issue>

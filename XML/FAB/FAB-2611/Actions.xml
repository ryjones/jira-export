CDATA  ~YuryAndreev  If I understand correctly, these are functions for user to get information on transaction in blocks.  Can you provide information on what is actually being "validated" ?  In any case, there's a "qscc" system chaincode that deals with block queries. For instance currently it returns the following information and may be more appropriate for this type of functions  {code:java} const ( GetChainInfo       string = "GetChainInfo" GetBlockByNumber   string = "GetBlockByNumber" GetBlockByHash     string = "GetBlockByHash" GetTransactionByID string = "GetTransactionByID" GetBlockByTxID     string = "GetBlockByTxID" ) {code}   You maybe able  * use the qscc methods to get the blocks and do any additional work on them on client side * modify existing methods in qscc to do the above * (as a last resort) introduce new functions in qscc   VSCC is meant to be used internally by the committer on receiving blocks from the orderer and is not meant to be invoked externally for query purposes.     ~denyeart   ~binhn   ></body> </Action>

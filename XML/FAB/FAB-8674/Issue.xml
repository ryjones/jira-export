CDATA There are two aspects to the authentication layer used by chaincode support. The first is the generation of certificates for the handshakes from the chain code to the peer and the second is client authentication via certificates when the support server is accessed. The current factoring combines the two.  A different factoring would be to present a certificate generator to the chaincode support layer that could be used to create and propagate certificates to the launched chain code and middleware style authentication layer that wraps (instead of embedding) the chain code server for access control.  In general, we should try to adopt the middleware pattern where possible.  ></description> </Issue>

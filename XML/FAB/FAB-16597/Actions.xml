CDATA The noted error occurs when the dumped text to stdout exceeds 64K, so I see no evidence that the root cause of the test failure was because of a join failure. We really should split this into TWO bugs; one is just a problem displaying the logs - which also means we don't have enough logs to see where the problem DID occur.  Note: when looking in the logs, we see that the chaincode had not been instantiated successfully in the channel on the peer. We should put in a workaround for the data dumping problem (to redirect the logs to a file instead of stdout) in order to see all the logs, so we can see the exact error (whether join, or install, or instantiate, etc). Or, someone could run the test outside of the CI (locally or vlaunch) and collect logs. {quote} 32minfo 39m:  2019-09-13T02:12:35.275Z PTE 1 main : stdout:  32minfo 39m:  2019-09-13T02:12:35.275Z PTE 1 exec :  Nid:chan:org:id=0:testorgschannel2:org2:0 invoke_query_simple  query 1000  result 0 : Error: make sure the chaincode marbles02_go_ch2 has been successfully defined on channel testorgschannel2 and try again: chaincode marbles02_go_ch2 not found {quote}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA THis passes in CI, even without FABN-1393 solution, because CI defaults to using gopath.  We can close this because our own tests pass, but FABN-1393 still should be finished.  ></body> </Action>

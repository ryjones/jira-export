CDATA A new consensus option, etcd/raft, is being developed for the next release with FAB-6135. This is an associated epic to identify the tools and testcases necessary for system testing.  This is where add all system verification tests (SVT) involving the etcd/raft-based ordering service.  A few guidelines: # We'll be adding a test task per test. # For each test, we describe the test's setup, inputs, and expected outputs in detail. # We'll avoid acronyms as much as possible, and go with descriptions in plain english. # We'll keep logs of both successful and unsuccessful runs around.  Anything that applies to all system verification tests should be recorded as a comment under this epic.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When using the TLS certs signed by a CA different from Org CAs (ex. digicert, godaddy, etc), the orderer does not accept connections from the peer for the deliver call on join channel: {quote}(Error: x509: Certificate signed by unknown authority). {quote} Workaround: Copying the TLS root certs in the orderer's msp/cacert folder will make the orderer accept connections from the peer. This also makes the orderer allow transactions signed by any peer using the certs signed by the same root CA as the TLS Certs, which is a security concern.  We should have a way to provide peers' TLS root certificates to the orderer (maybe in msp/tlscacert folder).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA MSPs may be configured with a set of root CAs, and optionally a set of intermediate CAs. Each root CA defines a tree of certificate hierarchies. What we need to ensure that validateIdentity function of the MSP accepts if and only if the identity is no sibling to an intermediate CA in any of the MSP certificate trees.  Examples (assuming an identity ID, root CAs prefixed with "rCA", and intermediate CAs prefixed with iCA):  * Identity *ID* should be considered *valid*:    rCA                               or                               rCA1                 rCA2 /    \                                                                   /   \                     |    iCA1  iCA2                                                    iCA11   iCA12           *ID* |           *ID*  * Identity ID should be considered *invalid*:    rCA                               or                                  rCA1                 rCA2 /    |    \                                                                   /   \                     |   \  iCA1   *ID*  iCA2                                                    iCA11   iCA12        *ID*  iCA21     ></description> </Issue>

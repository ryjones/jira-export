CDATA  ~rameshthoomu  Can the problem be reproduced every time? Or intermittent? What percentage of time do you see it?  I know  ~jyellick  has mentioned an edge case (e.g. exacerbated when transactions are larger than expected) in Kafka where a message will get persisted twice. The duplicate transaction will end up getting invalidated so it is not a data integrity issue, but still annoying. If you can reproduce on demand we could look into ways to further minimize the chance of occurring in Kafka.  If this is the same issue Jason mentioned, then it would not be an issue with Raft orderer, which is the recommendation for all new deployments.  ></body> </Action>

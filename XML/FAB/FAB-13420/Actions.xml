CDATA *1. consortium*  total 5 orgs 3 orgs have two endorser peers each. the rest 2 orgs have one committer peers each. anchor peer is not configurated for these two orgs since each org has only one peers. In addition,  pvt gossip has no problem without anchor peer configuration in vagrant env with exactly same consortium setup.     *2. log file* full log file is too big so I 'grep' pvt error part.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sae imSon  Is the problem reproducible for every transaction?  Does it happen on an org with 1 peer or an org with 2 peers?  Are you sure you are endorsing on the org that owns the collection?  If you endorse on a peer that doesn't own the collection, it will not save the private data, and if gossip is not configured for cross-org communication (anchor peers), it will not push the data to collection members, and the data will be lost.  I recommend look at debug for one transaction (endorsement and commit) for the following components. :  {color:#34bc26}gossip.privdata,transientstore,ledgerstorage,pvtdatastorage{color}  {color:#34bc26} {color}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem is solved by below tasks. # clear existing ledger.   # create and apply anchor update tx for all peers. -> I still don't understand why anchor peer info for each org is not reflected, even though it was defined in configtx.yaml # set up external endpoint of all peers.   ></body> </Action>

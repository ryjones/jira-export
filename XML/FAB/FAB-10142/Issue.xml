CDATA 1) We need to describe the steps required to upgrade your network from v1.1 to v1.2  Upgrade procedure:  – Bring all binaries up to 1.2.  – Then enable one 1.2 Capability (through channel config transaction).  ==> Any 1.1 peer that is not upgraded to 1.2 will crash (which is designed behavior).  ==> 1.1 orderers will not crash, though it is recommended that all binaries are brought up to 1.2  2) We should provide an example how to upgrade BYFN i.e. Checkout v1.1 byfn at 11 Start it up Checkout v1.2 byfn Run upgrade steps against all 4 peers, orderer, ...    Contacts:   ~suryalnvs  - can help with the steps to update BYFN   ~bmos299  - can help with describing the process required     Existing Upgrade doc is at:   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading_your_network_tutorial.html      From Jason Y: It should be pretty simple, basically copying the v1.0-v1.1 instructions, and removing large sections of it.  I had not been planning to provide seed content, but I'm happy to do whatever is needed.    ></description> </Issue>

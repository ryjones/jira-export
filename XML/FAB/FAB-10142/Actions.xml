CDATA Suggested approach:  Remove 1.1 upgrade instructions from 'latest' version of the doc. Copy the 1.1 upgrade instructions and edit them for the 1.2 process.  Add the 1.2 upgrade instructions to the 'latest' version of the doc.  Mention at the top that in order to upgrade to 1.2 you must be at v1.1. If they are not at v1.1, point them to the V1.1 upgrade instructions in the v1.1 version of the docs.  So the result will be:  --  'latest' and (eventual) 1.2 version of the docs will have the upgrade instructions from 1.1  -- 1.1 version of the docs will have the upgrade instructions from 1.0.     ></body> </Action>

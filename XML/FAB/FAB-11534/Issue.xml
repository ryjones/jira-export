CDATA This story is to extend the existing 'peer chaincode list" command to support listing installed chaincodes via the new chaincode API.  The operation should be the same as before, but it should add a new '-N' parameter to indicate that the new lifecycle should be utilized, instead of the old.  It should invoke the '+lifecycle.QueryInstalledChaincodes' API, and print a list of name, version, hash.  Note, for the time being it is necessary to only allow querying installed chaincodes with '-N', the instantiated chaincodes will be covered in another story.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, a peer exits either it tries to join a channel that requires a capability that it does not support or one of the updated capabilities of a channel that a peer has already joined is not supported by the peer. This is going to be a problem if the peer participates in multiple channels.  Instead of exiting, peer should stop participating in the offending channel and continue to participate in other channels.  ></description> </Issue>

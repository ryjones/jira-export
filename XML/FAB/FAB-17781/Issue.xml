CDATA We don't destroy existing networks, so for this work we will run in a totally separate cluster. There is no need for a large cluster, as well will be testing small deployments at first. We should have enough space on the cluster for: * 2 orgs ** 2 Peer's per org *** 1 CA per org *** Use CouchDB ** 5 Raft Orderers in the same orgs as the peers  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I have encounter a very strange behavior of the orderer when domain name is *.local.  I try to setup a dev env with Kafka, and urls are :   orderer0.plasticbank.local  kafka0.plasticbank.local  kafka1.plasticbank.local  kafka2.plasticbank.local  kafka3.plasticbank.local  Orderer panics (see attached logs). If I change domain from *.local* to *.localhost* everything is working as expected.   I have necessary records in /etc/hosts  It may be OS or docker issue, but I am able to access urls ending with .local using grpc at this machine.

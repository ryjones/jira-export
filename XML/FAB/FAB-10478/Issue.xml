CDATA *Noted: The work is still in drafting, welcome to add comments in the spec.*  Currently, Fabric controls the access using policies. However, there is no unique governing model, i.e., different governing policies are implemented following different policy models and may involve several components. E.g., some policies are defined in the channel as configurations, with guaranteeing some Reader, Writer, Admin roles, while other policy like node are defined in system chaincodes, chaincode policies are defined in user input and executed by system chaincodes.  It will be easy to confuse what policies are supported, what roles are guarantees, and what operations can be done with given resource.  Even the experimental RSCC    is finally deprecated, partially due to unclear governing model.  In this spec, we want to provide a unique governing model for all important resources in the network, following the same process and capabilities.

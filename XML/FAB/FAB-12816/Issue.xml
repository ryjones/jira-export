CDATA The egress wrapper for the cluster communication caches the last Submit stream and only reacquires it if a Send() or Recv() was attempted and failed.  This is problematic because a leader may change while there is no call to Send() or Recv() in a follower node, and then the stream will be mapped to a node that is no longer the leader.   ></description> </Issue>

Or do we have history with an API?  One thing that I notice here is that it appears that the stub is not involved, which means that history is not a part of the read/write set. Is this true? If so, can we really consider the history to have the same authority as the ledger itself, which was passed through endorsement and has consent?Â   ></body> </Action>

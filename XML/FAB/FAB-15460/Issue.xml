CDATA A very simple network was set up for Private Data testing purposes. In this case, the focus is not on privacy among peers inside a channel but the right to be forgotten (delete private data). In this scenario, there are two orgs (as example: honda and yamaha) with two peers each one.     peer0 of each organization has been configured to be the anchor peer and both organizations are included in the private collection in the motogpchannel.     A problem is observed when setting collections_config.json: * When the field *requiredPeerCount is different to zero* the following error is prompted when invoking (putPrivateData):  {quote}{{ESCC invoke result: response:<status:500 message:"Failed disseminating 1 out of 1 private RWSets" > }} {{Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"Failed disseminating 1 out of 1 private RWSets"}} {quote} * Whereas *requiredPeerCount is zero* the invoke succeeds but we observe that private data is not shared among the peers. When querying (GetPrivateData) from a different peer who has invoked, the private data can't be retrieved and nothing is found in CouchDB.     The anchor peers seem to be correctly configured in configtx.yaml and the external end points configured and reachable (tested pinging peer0.honda to/from peer0.yamaha). All peers are running and joined to motogpchannel and the MSP names in the configurations match.  In theory, both cases should work correctly but none of them seems to work correctly.  ></description> </Issue>

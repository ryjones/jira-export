CDATA Noticed that when a peer leaves an application channel (peer container is rebuild with no disk mounting enabled, so channel data on the peer gets wiped out) and when the peer rejoins the same channel again the prior blocks become invalid only on the peer that was rebuilt.   Tried peer node reset on the peer that left the channel but prior blocks are still invalid.   Network setup:   2 Org - 4 Peers (2 peers per Org)  HF: 1.4.2        ></description> </Issue>

This has a multitude of security and correctness problems, but also produces a lot of redundant and unnecessary code.  The peer should be converted to utilize the existing configtx.Manager code which does proper configuration transaction validation and provides a simple interface for users of that configuration." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-01-19 17:01:14.0" updated="2018-07-20 18:56:08.0" resolutiondate="2017-01-31 19:28:10.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="37112"/>

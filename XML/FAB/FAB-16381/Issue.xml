CDATA Add a health check mechanism in PTE to check the active status of the containers. Existing PTE long run tests, keeps sending traffic to the end points irrespective of the status of the containers. Take an example of 12 hr long run test,  After 1-2 hrs if the containers are stopped/crashed, then the PTE keeps sending the transactions till 12 hrs. This approach consumes system resources unnecessarily till the completion of the test. Instead of that, if we implement a mechanism of checking the health of the docker containers frequently while the test is running.  ></description> </Issue>

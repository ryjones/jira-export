CDATA This is what I am thinking to implement this task in PTE.  While the PTE is client is sending transactions to the network, we have to launch an another thread to perform health check (Check whether the containers are up and running or not with for every 15 to 30 mins interval). This thread has to stop the running PTE client.  The above step avoids sending false transactions to the network even though the network is not ready to accept the transactions. This avoids unnecessary billing when running network on a cloud instances where every sec is important from billing POV.  cc  ~dongming   ~scottz   ></body> </Action>

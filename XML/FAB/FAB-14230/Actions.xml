CDATA The message complexity of raft protocol is O( n), so i would expect throughput to drop as cluster getting bigger.     I think it would be nice to get a grip on the impact of network latency/throughput and disk speed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Two suggestions: # Given time constraints, let's make the step size bigger: 3-18-36. # Given time constraints, let's prioritize a test with, say, 3 or 5 OSNs, and heavy traffic on 500 channels. Then we can get back to this.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Two test are executed for each test scenarios (orderer=27, 54, 108). 1. fixed incoming rate, TPS=100 for 90 min 2. stress test with constant mode, i.e., send tx as soon as poosible Transactions: for orderers=27 and 54, 54 threads with 10k tx each thread, total 540,000 transactions are sent.  Each transaction has payload size=8B using local disk.  Each test is executed twice. The results are as follow:  27 orderers test 1: both passed, client (PTE) receives all transaction events test 2: passed, client receives all transaction events, TPS=827.33 test 2: passed, client receives all transaction events, TPS=823.23  54 orderers: test 1: both passed, client (PTE) receives all transaction events test 2: passed, client receives all transaction events, TPS=799.59 test 2: passed, client receives all transaction events, TPS=721.57  108 orderers: test 1: both passed, client (PTE) receives all transaction events test 2: passed, client receives all transaction events, TPS=638.76 test 2: failed, 33 broadcast tx failed due to SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE and misses 2172 events, (see FAB-14678)  ></body> </Action>

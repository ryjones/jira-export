<Issue id="29707" key="FAB-9716" number="9716" project="10002" reporter="kchristidis" creator="kchristidis" type="10004" summary="Relative paths in Kafka.TLS not evaluated properly" priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-04-25 22:21:39.0" updated="2020-01-22 22:34:12.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:34:12.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="35720"> <description><! CDATA What happens today:  If you: # Use relative paths as values for the {{File}} keys in {{orderer.yaml}}, and # Invoke the orderer process from a different path than the one that {{orderer.yaml}} resides in  ...then those files will not be loaded by the configuration.  The reason for this is that the {{stringFromFile}} and {{pemBlocksFromFile}} decode hooks, — responsible for resolving the file paths and loading the corresponding files — are called before {{completeInitialization}}, so they do {{current working directory}} + {{relative path}} in order to resolve the absolute path.  See {{Load}} in {{orderer/common/localconfig/config.go}} and notice how {{viperutil.EnhancedExactUnmarshal}} is called before {{completeInitialization}}.  Perhaps there is some wizardry that we can come up with in those decode hooks in order to make them resolve the right path ({{config dir}} + {{relative path}}), but my vote is to remove these hooks altogether, as well as the {{File:}} option.  Instead, {{Kafka.TLS}} should be _identical_ to {{General.TLS}}.  ></description> </Issue>

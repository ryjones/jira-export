CDATA I've been working on animating this and other diagrams using the  GSAP|https://greensock.com/products/  animation library. The coded animation can be found here:  https://codepen.io/dlesaca/pen/xrPaBZ?editors=1010|https://codepen.io/dlesaca/pen/xrPaBZ?editors=1010. . The animations turned out great and I believe add a lot to the diagrams. One caveat to using this library is that part of the library requires a membership  subscription|https://greensock.com/club . In order to use these animations within our documentation, a subscription will need to be purchased.   ~ChristopherFerris  and  ~admarkel , I was told by  ~yuleeandrea  that you might be able to help with this?  Thanks, Dexter  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Chris and Tracy,  The Hyperledger IP policy requires that project documentation be contributed under the CC-BY-4.0 license, and code under Apache 2.0 (or under other open source licenses approved as an exception by the Governing Board).  It isn’t clear to me from the GreenSock website whether they permit the output from their tools to be relicensed under CC-BY-4.0. This sentence from their FAQs gives me pause, though: “You may not include any of the members-only bonus plugins/classes in your open source tool (for obvious reasons) and you must clearly represent that the GreenSock code uses its own separate licensing model.”  In the past I have seen a non-Hyperledger project try to use GreenSock, though I don’t know the specific context of their use. It resulted in the project code containing a number of comments stating that it was subject to GreenSock’s commercial terms of use.  ></body> </Action>

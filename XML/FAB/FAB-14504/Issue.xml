CDATA Define a minimal hardware configuration in a k8s cluster. For example, we could obtain a small free cluster from the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS). It could contain only a single VM host; set it up with one raft orderer, 1 or 2 peers, 1 CA server, 1 channel and 1 chaincode, with a small payload.  Ensure it can process transactions. Even 1 (or a few) per minute would be sufficient, like a user manually invoking their chaincode via UI.  Possible variation, stretch goal: Increase network size to 3 raft orderers, and 2 peers in separate orgs, and send transactions.  Stretch goal: Using HFRD, starting at a low rate, such as 0.1 tps, ramp up the traffic rate to determine the transactions per second (tps) it can handle successfully, until transactions get dropped or other troubles are encountered. (Raft does not guarantee the delivery of all transactions it receives, so the client user will need to register with a peer for block event notification.)  ></description> </Issue>

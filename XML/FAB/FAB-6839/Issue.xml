CDATA The configtx package has changed considerably over time, and no longer needs to be initialized with an envelope message. The only places which actually instantiate the configtx manager are creating an artificial Envelope message and mashaling the config inside it, purely to satisfy the constructor. This CR modifies the constructor to take the ultimately necessary type.  ></description> </Issue>

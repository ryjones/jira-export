CDATA * *Test Name*: FAB_4843-ORD105-sending txs to 3 orderers, 4 kafka brokers on 1 channel * *Component*: Orderer * *Description*:Â 1 Producer per Orderer-channel send 500,000 Tx to 3 orderers on 1 channel with 4 kafka brokers. Confirm all Tx delivered (wait/poll consumer as necessary), with no problems. (1) This will launch the network with the configuration mentioned below, starts the deliver clients first and each client will be connected to each orderer, starts broadcast clients for each orderer and starts sending the traffic to the orderers. (2) Using a separate thread, pause the first kafka broker, wait for 2 minutes, and then unpause it, wait for sometime, followed by other kafka brokers as well (3) Reconnect the broadcast clients to send the transactions and deliver clients to receive both before and after the orderer restarted * *Artifact Locations*: fabric/test/tools/OTE * *Network Topology*: 3 orderers, 4 kafka brokers, 3 zookeepers, 2 orgs with 2 peers in each * *Client Driver*: OTE * *Input*: go test -run ORD105 -timeout 50m * *Output*: if the test ran successfully, should be able to see pass as the output  ></description> </Issue>

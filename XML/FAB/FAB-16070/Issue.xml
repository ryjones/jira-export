CDATA The linked bug occurred a little more than 3 hours into a 12 hour traffic run in a CI VM. Running a longer test like this is already an objective in our k8s lab, and doing it soon could provide more info about that problem.  We can run single or multiple traffic tests, so long as we keep a single network up and running the entire time.  ></description> </Issue>

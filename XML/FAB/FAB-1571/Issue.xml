CDATA The error handling framework needs to be modified to allow easy internationalization of text in the future.   i18n4go (https://github.com/maximilien/i18n4go) seems like a good package to utilize for this. Does anyone have any other suggestions for packages to internationalize in Golang? Please add any comments/concerns below.   If the community agrees on this package, the work to prepare the error handling framework should primarily consist of getting rid of the concept of the error map as that will be handled by i18n4go and simply using a message string to store the error message.  Once that is done, we'll be set up for internationalization via i18n4go while also getting the benefits of the error handling framework (callstacks and error codes).

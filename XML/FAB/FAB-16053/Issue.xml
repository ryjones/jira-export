CDATA I want to contribute a new project based on fabric. I am calling him justitia for the time being. I hope to discuss and improve it with everyone here.  Â   Justitia helps consortium members generate and maintain all of their certificates, easily deploy and maintain their own nodes. On the other hand, it helps users manage the configuration of consortium and channels, including configurations such as members and policies.  To find out more about justitia, check out the project proposal ( justitia proposal | https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Justitia+Proposal ).  Thanks  ></description> </Issue>

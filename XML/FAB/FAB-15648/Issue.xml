CDATA Raft orderers need TLS for internal Raft communication. And they can make Raft communication on a different port than client facing port.   However it is not possible to enable TLS only for Raft port but not for client facing port. It would be nice to have this feature.  In our case we are running everything in a Kubernetes cluster so internal TLS is not requirement for us. Even later when some nodes are exposed to outer world, since we use a central Ingress for TLS termination, internal TLS wont be still a requirement.  *Edit:* As mentioned in the email list, in our case, enabling TLS globally has also another huge impact, we lost transparent load balancing for peer and orderer nodes. Please see TLS section in our  GitHub repo|https://github.com/APGGroeiFabriek/PIVT#limitations .        ></description> </Issue>

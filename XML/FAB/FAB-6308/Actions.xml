CDATA  ~Amit04Patel   ~denyeart  your -events-address should be the address of a running peer.  For example, if local, -events-address=127.0.0.1:7053  Please comment back if this does NOT address your issue.  Marking with 'won't-fix', but don't worry, will leave this open for a bit for you to comment if still an issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~jeffgarratt   The block-listener now works but sometimes with 127.0.0.1 or sometimes with 0.0.0.0  when I am running it on the same machine where peers are running  from my side, the issue is resolved   ></body> </Action>

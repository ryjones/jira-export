CDATA My Node.js app is running on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS.  The Blockchain network I originally used was created through an IBM Blockchain service on Bluemix.  Later, I reproduced this issue with a local network running in Docker containers on my Ubuntu machine.  ></environment> <description><! CDATA While trying to use the fabric-client 1.0.0-rc1 package with a Node.js app to get some information from a 1.0 blockchain network, I was using the {{Channel.queryInfo()}} API to get the height of the block and hashes of the current block and previous block, the hashes are identical. They should usually be different, shouldn't they?   {code:java} { "height": { "low": 12, "high": 0, "unsigned": true }, "currentBlockHash": { "buffer": { "type": "Buffer", "data":   8, 12, 18, 32, 218, 132, 75, 232, 0, 218, 95, 96, 28, 61, 133, 36, 146, 118, 89, 111, 68, 153, 67, 111, 130, 153, 7, 218, 34, 191, 84, 18, 101, 38, 178, 163, 26, 32, 92, 40, 64, 249, 117, 213, 168, 4, 82, 165, 81, 126, 219, 211, 115, 139, 15, 167, 128, 60, 76, 245, 78, 22, 167, 115, 73, 200, 58, 80, 230, 157   }, "offset": 4, "markedOffset": -1, "limit": 36, "littleEndian": true, "noAssert": false }, "previousBlockHash": { "buffer": { "type": "Buffer", "data":   8, 12, 18, 32, 218, 132, 75, 232, 0, 218, 95, 96, 28, 61, 133, 36, 146, 118, 89, 111, 68, 153, 67, 111, 130, 153, 7, 218, 34, 191, 84, 18, 101, 38, 178, 163, 26, 32, 92, 40, 64, 249, 117, 213, 168, 4, 82, 165, 81, 126, 219, 211, 115, 139, 15, 167, 128, 60, 76, 245, 78, 22, 167, 115, 73, 200, 58, 80, 230, 157   }, "offset": 38, "markedOffset": -1, "limit": 70, "littleEndian": true, "noAssert": false } } {code}  I'm attaching: * a JSON of the result from {{queryInfo()}} since Jira wasn't retaining the leading blanks * {{package.json}} from {{fabric-client/}} after installing it on the Ubuntu machine where the Node.js application was run  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I don't know how to set up a blockchain with the latest code.Â  I tried going through the same steps I laid out earlier but I got the same results.  I am leaving IBM today and the email I registered with this Jira server will soon stop working.  Jira doesn't seem to give me a way to change it so I emailed the helpdesk for assistance.  ></body> </Action>

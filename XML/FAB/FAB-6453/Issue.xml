CDATA Refer to https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1_1 and the New Feature JIRA blocking this. This is for a tech preview feature.  Note: this capability (using build flags) is one way of controlling what goes into a load. Another is using run-time flags, to allow network admin to turn features on/off, typically after all nodes are upgraded. (If any nodes are not upgraded, then they would stop participating in the network.) Some tech-preview features might use that instead of (or in addition to) build flags. I am not sure if there is much system testing we can do exclusively for FAB-6020. It is probably just a matter of running feature tests for a specific feature(s) to ensure they fail when it is not built into the load when its build flag is off (and automated tests complete successfully for other features), and that the feature tests pass when it is included and fully functional when the build flag is enabled.  Not sure yet which features would be guarded by build flags, but it is likely some are the tech-preview features that are listed in the wiki (see link, above).  ></description> </Issue>

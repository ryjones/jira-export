CDATA *Acceptance*: A (simulated) client constructs a request to construct an issue proof by  providing the type and quantity of assets to be introduced into the system, and invokes  the peer API. The peer would need to construct the corresponding issue proof and return  it to the (simulated) client. Acceptance would require that the constructed proof matches  the input parameters of the request.     Prover peer component is here linked to a fully implemented TMS Issuer that is leveraged for proof computation. This is done by implementing the local interfaces specified in FAB-11351 with code that leverages the TMS component defined in FAB-11293. Client requests may still be unauthenticated (not carry any real signature).  ></description> </Issue>

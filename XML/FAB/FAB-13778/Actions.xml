CDATA https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28791/ fixes this, but I am not going to merge this into master since I'm anyway going to do a rework this week. In the meantime I suggest you set a sane timeout like 5 seconds, and not 45 seconds.   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="55928" issue="36964" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Sure, we can reduce the timeout on the client so it moves on to the next transaction sooner. But the bigger objective of this may be to ensure the orderers send ACK/NACK responses for as many broadcast transactions as possible in as many situations as possible, instead of leaving clients to wonder how long to wait. If the orderers are just slow, then resending transactions could mean sending duplicates, which would just add a bigger strain on the system." created="2019-01-21 15:26:26.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-01-21 15:26:26.0"/>

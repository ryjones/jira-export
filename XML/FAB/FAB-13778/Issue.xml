CDATA h2. Steps to Reproduce:  Set up and run testcase scenario2 as defined in FAB-13604. h2. Observed:  A transaction broadcast on the application testorgchannel1 to OSN1 was never ACKed. Nor NACKed. Interestingly, this was the first transaction after the OSN1 orderer logs indicated a leadership change in testorgchannel1 from OSN3 to OSN2, which happened after we stopped OSN2, at 2019-01-16 15:30:11.190 in the attached logfileÂ snapshot-OSN1-FAB-13604-scenario2.log. Consequently the client hung until a lengthy 45s timer popped in the PTE client (using node-sdk). For a more detailed description, interspersed with some key logs, refer to attachment: * bug5-description.txt  For the full logs from the orderers, refer to attachments on FAB-13604: * snapshot-OSN1-FAB-13604-scenario2.log * snapshot-OSN2new-FAB-13604-scenario2.log * snapshot-OSN3-FAB-13604-scenario2.log  h2. Expected:  The OSN should NACK any received transaction which it knows cannot be ordered.  ></description> </Issue>

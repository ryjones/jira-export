For releases, plan to run long test in k8s cluster. Let's do one now in 1.4.4 to make sure is stable and successful. Then can close this as infrastructure issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA 12hour test passed in k8s cluster last night. Now that we have that running regularly, let's delete this NL/PTE 12hour test and stop the job, which is apparently failing due to infrastructure/resources reasons.  Possible alternative: we could run in the Azure environment - but that does not allow jobs more than 6 hours.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As a fabric administrator, I want to use a fit-for-purpose function that adds an application org definition to a channel configuration. The result of this function should be a channel transaction that can be passed to other functions that can further mutate the config.  *Acceptance*  Calling the new function with appropriate arguments should generate a config transaction that contains a new application org. The examples test should also be updated to demonstrate usage of this feature.  ></description> </Issue>

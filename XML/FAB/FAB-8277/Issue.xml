CDATA Presently, before applying a channel creation transaction, a 'template config' is created by copying various pieces of the orderer system channel into a new config, then applying the channel creation tx as an update.  This works well in greenfield deployments, but as the orderer system channel mutates, so does the template config.  Users would have to deduce the correct versions to use in computing their config updates, which becomes onerous and requires out of band communication.  ></description> </Issue>

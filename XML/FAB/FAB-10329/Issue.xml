CDATA The integration tests rely on a number of docker images. When the required images are not present on the local docker daemon, the tests fail in odd ways.  When the fabric components are built for the integration test, we need to decide if we want to fail fast with an easy to diagnose issue (eg. run make docker) of if we want to try to acquire/create the artifacts on the fly.  While I would prefer to acquire/create on the fly, concrete implementations involve running a make target from the fabric directory (somewhat fragile) or writing code to do the same thing as the makefile (a maintenance nightmare)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Record how long it takes to launch chaincode and, when complete, whether or not it's successful. That should be a single histogram with labels. All metrics for chaincode should include a chaincode name that includes its version; this string will need to be sanitized for use with Statsd and Prometheus. (Find a transform that works and consider a separate task that puts it into the statsd namer to keep people from having to concern themselves with it.)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Our tests will run for a week at a time. Create a pipeline to drive traffic for 4 hours at a time and is on a cronjob to run every 12 hours. Once we have new build agents, we will be able to drive this traffic for 24 hours.  We can do simple invokes and queries in parallel using multiple stages.

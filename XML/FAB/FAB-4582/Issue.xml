CDATA The gossip proto file has the following section for channel_mac:  {code} // channel_MAC is an authentication code that proves // that the peer that sent this message knows // the name of the channel. // The channel name that this message relates to // can only be computed by a peer that has joined // the channel {code}  This is a bit misleading since the name of the channel can be computed by dictionary attacks where the name of the channel is guessed, and also by simply knowing the name of the channel beforehand.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~denyeart  - It took me a while to recollect about this. Luckly, I could find more context ( https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric/+/30624/28/core/ledger/kvledger/kv_ledger.go@620)  that would help understand this.  Since the metadata indexing is planned as a part of larger refactoring under FAB-16190, and the benefits of this optimization would be limited to the reconciliation path, I would make this task to leverage when FAB-16190 is done.  So, IMO, this can be made as a dependent of FAB-16190.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Organizations can indeed install different chaincodes starting in v2.0. This is by design and documented here:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode_lifecycle.html#organizations-install-different-chaincode-packages   As you say, an organization can use this feature to add additional validations before agreeing to the transaction and providing their endorsement. If they don't want to endorse transactions coming from client X, that is their prerogative. Client X must gather endorsements from the required number of organizations that wish to endorse the transaction.  Since this is working as designed and documented, closing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Create a weekly PTE job to run 12 hr longrun in hyperledger Jenkins. Execute -FAB-7204--4i.sh script from weekly tab  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/tree/master/regression/weekly.   You can split this task into: # Create a script 12HrTest.py which invokes the test script listed above. _(The 12HrTest.py will look similar to fabric-test/regression/weekly/systest_pte.py)._ # Create a script which executes it, such as run12HrTest.sh _(similar to runGroup2.sh)_ # Create a weekly CI job to execute run12HrTest.sh. _(For future consideration: consider pros and cons of whether or not we should maintain a single weekly jenkins job which could kick off several different tests which we will be putting in the weekly folder - as explained in the weekly/README; or maybe instead we should create individual jenkins jobs per each of several groups of tests, with each group running anywhere from a few hours to a few days.)_  ></description> </Issue>

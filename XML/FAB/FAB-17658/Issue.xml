CDATA As a user of the Fabric channel configuration API, I would like to see smaller and more varied example usages for updating the config instead of one giant end to end flow that updates every field.  Â   *Acceptance*  For now let's split out separate update examples dealing specifically with * updating orderer configuration (including orderer policies) * updating application specific values (including application policies) * organization management (adding/removing orgs and anchor peers/orderer endpoints to application orgs and orderer orgs respectively) * msp modifications * capabilities (application, orderer, and channel)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Investigate the orderer start sequence considering the scenario where the system channel has been removed from an existing network. * Do we have to set bootstrap method to none in the orderer config for these existing networks? (The obvious thing is that it will log at the info level   "Not bootstrapping the system channel because of existing channels"|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/orderer/common/server/main.go#L128  ). * Does the bootstrap block need to be set to "" for this scenario? * Consider doc update related to bootstrap method and bootstrap block config options after removing system channel.  ></description> </Issue>

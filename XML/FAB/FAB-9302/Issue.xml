CDATA Tutorials BYFN and Add an org to channel are quite long (but useful!). But it is easy for the user to loose track of what he is actually doing since to tutorials go on for so long.     I think it would be beneficial for these tutorials to provide a roadmap or summarize the list of steps before the step-by-step instructions so the user does not loose the context of what they are doing.     ></description> </Issue>

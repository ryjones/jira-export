CDATA Indeed, I know where it went! :)  This is part of the samples that I took on to move from the fabric repo to the fabric-samples repo. The change therefore involved two different CRs: one that removed samples from fabric and one that added them back to fabric-samples. The first one was accepted and merged, but the second one was blocked by  ~mastersingh24  on the basis that we did not have adequate support for those samples. So, my CR stayed in limbo for a while and I eventually abandoned it (see  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28887/ )  But Gari had said he was blocking it "for now". So, he might be open to adding the Encc sample. If that were the case I'd be happy to resubmit a CR for that.     ></body> </Action>

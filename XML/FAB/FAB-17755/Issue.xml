CDATA The CouchDB creates an index in the background and responds to the REST API immediately. Currently, we wait only for 2 seconds before failing the test. Within the 2 seconds, every 100 msecs, CouchDB is queried to ensure that the passed index is being built and can be used for the query. On a first success, the test is passed.   As we have only 2 vCPUs, 4 GB of RAM to run CI, it may not be sufficient enough for CouchDB to build index within the 2 seconds. Further, if we run tests in parallel, the CouchDB could face CPU contention too. Note that the CouchDB consumes 3x higher CPU utilization as compared to the goleveldb.  Hence, we increase the wait time to 6 seconds and the query time to 1 second.   ></description> </Issue>

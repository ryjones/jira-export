CDATA The peer uses MSP keys for two different purposes: * signing and verifying fabric protocol messages * engaging in TLS handshakes  This is a security anti-pattern: key material should only be used in the context of a single protocol to perform one specific function.  While no immediate exploitations of this vulnerability has been found, the following should be evidence enough that we should fix it: any entity that has the right to invoke or query a chaincode receives ESCC signatures in response. If the same keypair that generates this signature is also used in the course of a TLS handshake, it is conceivable that an adversary may use ESCC as a signing oracle and use the responses to attempt to conduct a successful TLS handshake, pretending to be the peer.      ~ellaki ,  ~elli-androulaki ,  ~adc ,  ~adecaro ,  ~angelo.decaro ,  ~mastersingh24 : your thoughts?  ></description> </Issue>

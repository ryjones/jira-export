CDATA Hi  ~mastersingh24   you are correct, there is no threat vector here. Unfortunately, some security scanners will simply pick up the version of the main runc package (ignoring that the actual sub package that gets imported is harmless) and falsely report we are vulnerable. Updating the dep will simply remove that incorrect threat assessment from being reported and would make a bunch of security people a bit happier.  ></body> </Action>

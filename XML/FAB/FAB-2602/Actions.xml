CDATA Yes, the enroll response will contain the cert chain of the issuing CA, which is the same as will be returned by the GET /info call. I'm also trying to consider the following two cases: 1) root fabric-ca-server is issued a CA cert by a corporate CA In this case, we may want to include the corporate CA's cert in the chain. 2) root fabric-ca-server is issued a CA cert by a non-corporate CA (e.g. Verisign) In this case, we wouldn't want to include Verisign in the chain. To handle both cases, the root fabric-ca-server will simply check for the existence of a root.pem file (configurable name). If it exists, I'll just use it and it could itself be a chain.  If it doesn't exist, then I'll use the CA cert itself.  The bottom line is that I want the 1st cert in this chain that is returned to be the cert that should be a root of trust in the ordering service.  Does this sound correct?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Create a build process for {{fabric-chaincode-go}}. This process should lint the code (yes, lint - including godoc), vet the code, and run tests.  The build process should be tied into github to ensure that the code is tested prior to merge.  Acceptance: change requests cause a build and test to occur. Successful builds result in a +1 vote and failed builds result in a -1 vote.  ></description> </Issue>

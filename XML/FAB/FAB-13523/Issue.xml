The first step is to remove the existing implementation out and into its own module, and inject it as a dependency." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2019-01-07 04:08:27.0" updated="2019-01-23 13:31:47.0" resolutiondate="2019-01-23 13:31:47.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="48057"/>

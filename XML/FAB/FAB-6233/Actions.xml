CDATA I propose that we proceed with behavior #3 but in a way that doesn't violate the separation of concerns between the orderer and the peer.  Specifically, I propose that we define a namespace under the configuration tree where we enumerate the ChannelHeader types that will be cut into their own block. I was originally thinking of a Value under /Orderer/, in which case the "we" in "we enumerate" would be the orderer admins and this configuration would be scoped per ordering service. But following our discussion in Rocket.Chat I agree that /Channel/Application/ makes better sense â€“ in this case, it is the channel admins who set this value and its effect is, obviously, channel-scoped.  The benefit of this proposal is that it maintains the separation of concerns between the orderer and the peer. It also gives us a mechanism to extend the list of message types that should be cut into their own blocks.  As Jason noted when we discussed this, this will require custom logic for the 1.0 to 1.1 upgrade scenario; this type is not defined on 1.0 channel configurations. Even though there is precedent for this (see our fix on the mod_policy), the concern is valid; we should cut down on throwaway code.  I still think however that the benefits outweigh the downsides for this one.  ></body> </Action>

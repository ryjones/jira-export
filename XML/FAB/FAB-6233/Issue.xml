CDATA Peer resource config updates are very similar to standard channel config updates, in that they affect how transactions are validated.  Since transactions are validated in general a block at a time, if one transaction affects the way another is validated (aside from MVCC), it's not obvious what the correct behavior should be.  1. State that config updates always affect _subsequent_ blocks only. Pros: Very easy to implement Cons: Unintuitive to users and auditors  2. Make config updates take affect immediately for subsequent transactions in the block Pros: Intuitive to users/auditors Cons: Makes doing parallel tx validation much more difficult (blocks must be broken down into parallelizable batches which do not include the config updates)  3. Have the orderer enforce that config updates are always in their own block Pros: Easy to implement, intuitive for users Cons: Violates separation of concerns for ordering around peer specific behavior.  We need to decide on one of these behaviors.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Tests can be traffic runs with various feature/functional configurations.  Tests can also be carefully planned Performance tests, using tweaked config variations for comparison, to get TPS measurements.  Concurrency is the use of parallel threads as we target the system components in various configurations - for example: # single peer, single chan, multiple threads # many peers and clients sending TX to single orderer on one/or/many channels  (Note: We will cover some concurrency inherently with the large networks Scalability tests, as well as the Stress tests.)  ></description> </Issue>

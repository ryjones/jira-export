CDATA The gossip code that handles pull block data updates has an optimization that first performs a simulation of adding an inner block message to the message store, and only if the simulation is successfulÂ  - it then verifies the message.  The problem is that the simulation is done against the outer message, and thus the optimization does not occur.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As part of correcting some compilation issues, the chaincode implementations were separated from the main package(s). The main package for the impacted samples now live under a cmd folder in the example.  Since some of the examples were actually used as test fixtures, some of the users needed updates to reflect the new location of the main.  Given the need to update callers anyway, we removed chaincode_ prefix from the directory names and the _exampleXX suffix chaincode source files as they were redundant. (The examples were already located in examples/chaincode/.../exampleXX folders.)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In v1.4.2 org specific OrdererEndpoints was added to channel configuration. Either the global Addresses or the org specific OrdererEndpoints can be used starting in v1.4.2.  In v2.0 the intent is to remove support for the Orderer global addresses with this work item. Upon enablement of V2_0 capability, channels must be configured to use the org specific OrdererEndpoints. The orderer endpoint config change can be made in the same configuration transaction as the V2_0 capability enablement.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I suggest the following:  # With a v2.0 peer that is at channel version of 1.4.2, if you try to upgrade to 2.0 without per org endpoints, you'll get a failure at validating the config transaction. # Drop the possibility of specifying the global endpoints in the v2.0 configtx.yaml sample, but still keep it in the code base for backwards compatibility for channels that are v1.4.2 and haven't upgraded to v2.0 yet. # In later versions such as v2.1 or so, remove it from the code base entirely.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm fine with disallowing the global orderer endpoints along with the V2_0 capability.  However, we all know that dropping support from the codebase is a tricky thing.  We will not be able to drop support for processing config with old endpoints until we have checkpoint and pruning support, to allow peers to join at a later configuration block and not be forced to process the blockchain from block 0.  We still need to handle the case where a peer is late joined to the genesis block of a long running channel and must connect to the initial set of globally defined orderers to catch up, so I don't think we can entirely remove the support.   ~yacovm  am I missing something?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I was hoping by 2.1 the peer won't need to process the endpoints of the pre v2.0 config blocks and can join from the latest config block, like orderers can.   ></body> </Action>

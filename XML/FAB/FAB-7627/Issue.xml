CDATA Test name: Performance test: transaction events, 8 channels Component: Performance test Description: performance events per channel with levelDB     chaincode: each channel has one chancode, sample_cc, instantiated     transactions: 16 threads, each thread sends 10000 invokes concurrently          thread 1 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 2 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 1, registers events for channel1          thread 3 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2          thread 4 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 2, registers events for channel2           thread 5 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 3, registers events for channel3          thread 6 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 3, registers events for channel3          thread 7 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 4, registers events for channel4          thread 8 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 4, registers events for channel4           thread 9 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 5, registers events for channel5          thread 10 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 5, registers events for channel5          thread 11 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 6, registers events for channel6          thread 12 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 6, registers events for channel6           thread 13 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 7, registers events for channel7          thread 14 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 7, registers events for channel7          thread 15 sends to org1 peer1 on channel 8, registers events for channel8          thread 16 sends to org2 peer1 on channel 8, registers events for channel8  Network Topology: docker containers; 8 channels, 2 org, 2 peers per org, 4 kafka, 3 zookeepers, 3 orderers, 2 ca, TLS enabled, both org associate with all channels Client Driver: PTE Results: The test passes if     the execution completes without error     each thread receives all events associated with the channel it registered, and verifies            events received for every transaction it sent itself The TPS (transactions per second) will be calculated and documented.  ></description> </Issue>

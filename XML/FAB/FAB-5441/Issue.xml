CDATA The reconfiguration flow requires multiple signatures for most configuration updates.  However, the only way to sign those updates outside of the SDK today is the peer CLI.  The peer CLI needs to support this workflow in some manner.  The most direct is probably to simply sign but not submit, and instead write to the filesystem.  In this way, the peer CLI can be invoked multiple times with different crypto identities to form a collection of signatures over the configtx.  ></description> </Issue>

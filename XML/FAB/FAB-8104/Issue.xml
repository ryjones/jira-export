CDATA PTE document: 1) Recommend clarifying the fact that in section "running PTE" it should run from the installed location under {{fabric-test/fabric-sdk-node/test/PTE}} instead of {{fabric-test/tools/PTE}}  2) from the readme, replace all hardcoded gopaths with generic paths e.g. remove {{root/gopath}} with {{$GOPATH}} 3)  in the section "creating a local Fabric network", the first bullet point is actually a prerequisite, and the next two steps are either-or. This section should be formatted accordingly to avoid confusion. 4) Add sub-section for "if you are using mac" in the pre-requisite section with the following info:  Only for Mac, you need to install a gnu-compatible version of the  awk, date utility: * Install Brew:  http://brew.sh|http://brew.sh/  * run {{brew install gawk —-with-default-names; brew install gdate —-with-default-names}} in order to swap out Mac's default tar command for a gnu-compliant one.   This will be deferred for a future CR: PTE code: 1) replace all instance of hardcoded path with generic paths eg replace {{/home/ibmadmin/gopath/}} with {{$GOPATH}}  ></description> </Issue>

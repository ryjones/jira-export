<Action id="30275" issue="19949" author="pmullaney" type="comment" body="as far as I knew, the mechanism to register directly with the fabric is still present in fabric-peer. This won&apos;t return the expected results as no chaincode events are sourced via the peer any longer. I&apos;d like to either fail the registration or take it out of the protobuf definition. Its causing confusion as I have seen sdk implementations attempting to use it." created="2017-08-28 19:07:44.0" updateauthor="pmullaney" updated="2017-08-28 19:07:44.0"/>

CDATA I think the part that often goes missing is that the fabric registry is not a location for retrieving production ready images. The images in our registry are only meant to support the Fabric-Samples (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) repo, and thus they only contain the necessary components for running these samples.  We document on the fabric-peer Dockerhub page that users should maintain their own images for production use cases or use cases outside the scope of Fabric-Samples. Invariably the question is why?  We do our best, but provide no guarantee that security patches will be applied to our open source images. With every release we update our images to the latest available software versions, but we provide no mitigations for unpatched security flaws. True production use cases are far more sensitive to timely security patches, and the only way to make sure the images are patched to an appropriate level for every use case, is for individual organizations to maintain their images themselves. If a critical CVE is published for something as simple as node.js, could your organization really wait a few weeks to a few months for open source to deliver you new images. For our images, we may not be sensitive to the CVE, because the images are for sample uses only, not production use cases.  Â Hope this helps explain the reasoning behind why we don't publish additional images.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello, I've been around a couple of years by now and there's one discussion I didn't understand until now: For an enterprise environment, pkcs11 is highly necessary, yet we need to keep a fork in order to modify images and make sure compiled peer/orderer has been built with properly tags (as you can install lib on a start script the presence of the lib in the image is not in my concern here).  Why can't we provide images built with pkcs11 in the fabric's registry?   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  Had a bug in the pull algorithm:  The NONCE set was actually needed to be split into 2 diff sets, because servicing sync requests has nothing to do with initiating them, and the cleanup of initiated sync requests effected sync requets that were serviced.   Added a unit test that successfully reproduced the bug, and after I fixed it it always succeeds.

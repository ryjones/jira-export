There you will see that along with the data, you get execution time and total number of results returned. At the moment, the chaincode API does not provide any of this information back to the developer. It would be great if some of this information that CouchDB already provides in the response is made available to the developer through the chaincode API." priority="4" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2018-10-12 22:05:49.0" updated="2020-01-22 22:32:35.0" resolutiondate="2020-01-22 22:32:35.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="46053"/>

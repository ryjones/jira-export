CDATA The acl provider registration was typically used to register a mock ACLProvider during tests.  On the production side, the registration was done when starting the peer and the argument was always {{nil}} - causing the creation and registration of the default provider. Registration was also protected by a sync.Once to ensure only the first registration would take effect. The implication appears to be that the peer will always start and register the "default" ACL provider.  Since we're trying to move to a model where we explicitly present dependencies to their users, it's time to remove the globally scoped, package level instance and accessor and replace it with explicit wiring and dependencies.  ></description> </Issue>

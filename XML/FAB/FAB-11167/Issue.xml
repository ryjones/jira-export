CDATA Although there's a _Block Number_ attribute inside the _Block Header_ (explained at  Read-the-docs|https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/ledger/ledger.html#blocks ), there are  no attributes|https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/ledger/ledger.html#transactions  stated to know the depth of a transaction.  Some transaction attributes can be explored, e.g. name and version for its chaincode. But they have no link with other block transactions in a single channel, forcing developers to search workarounds, making the implementation heavier and adding an overhead.  As an example, Hyperledger Explorer inspects each block to store the _count_ value on a local database.  In order to provide new features, the ability to supply the "channel transaction count" value directly from the ledger is a nice improvement.  ></description> </Issue>

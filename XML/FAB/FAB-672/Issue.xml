CDATA Bootstrap a peer  To start up and connect to a consensus service, a Peer requires at least the following configurations: # An enrollment certificate to participate in the network. The certificate may come from any CA as long as the CA is part of the trusted roots on the consensus service that the Peer will connect to # A list of the Orderer certificates and IP addresses, which the administrative CLI from the consensus service can generate # A list of trusted roots # An optional list of channels that the Peer should subscribe. Unless explicitly configured, the Peer does not subscribe to any channels upon starting up  Either via CLI or application using SDK API, a Peer can be instructed to subscribe to existing channels. Access control on whom may join a channel is performed by the Orderers with the information given during channel creation or reconfiguration thereafter.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In core.yaml two options: “use leader election” and “is leader” { useLeaderElection: false, orgLeader: true } —> static leader  (When orgLeader is false and useLeaderElection is false, the peer will never connect directly to the orderer. Peer will panic if both are true.)  With the default configuration we actually use leader election to determine who connects to the peer: {code} useLeaderElection: true orgLeader: false {code}  {{reconnectTotalTimeThreshold}} controls how long before step down; default is 3600s; if connectivity is down for 1hr, the peer needs to be restarted as we will no longer attempt to connect to the orderer.  So, when configured as a static leader, logically disable (ignore) the reconnect threshold and continue attempts to connect to the orderer.  Based on our discussion, this is somewhat complicated by how gossip has been wired into the code.  ></body> </Action>

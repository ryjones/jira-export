CDATA The blocksprovider is configured with a total amount of time it should attempt to retrieve blocks before giving up.  This is useful for when leader election is enabled, because the leader peer might not be able to reach an ordering node (say because of a network partition) but another peer could.  However, when leader election is disabled, this means that if the peer loses contact with the orderers for a sufficient amount of time, the static leader will step down as leader, and never receive new blocks.  This is undesirable, and requires a peer restart to get the peer to begin acting as a leader again.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA FYI:  ~adc   This is in the sw bccsp, the code that I added for keystore search, after some discussion with Binh on making keystore file names user-friendly when they are generated by the user (i.e. via openssp), rather then by bccsp directly..  Sounds like the smarter thing to do is to check the file size before opening all files in the keystore directory..  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The loop in searchKeystoreForSKI() in fabric/bccsp/sw/fileks.go reads all the files in the keystore Dir. Purely by coincidence, I had a large test file in my configured keystore Dir.  20G May 24 16:03 bigfile  Consequently, the ioutil.ReadFile routine eventually fell over with a failed malloc().  Obviously I can clean this up for the purposes of test execution but the question remains, how safe is this? Do we need to protect against/limit this kind of file-based manipulation?  ></description> </Issue>

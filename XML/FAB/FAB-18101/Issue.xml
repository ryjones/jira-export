CDATA As  ~btl5037  recently pointed out in the PR for FAB-18066: "Because our existing configs had the Prefix property in them, the strong marshaling of the Orderer config prevents the orderer.yaml from being marshaled while containing this key. The fix was to mount all of our volumes in kubernetes to secondary pods and remove the key. This is kind of breaking backwards compatibility, and would be a pain for anyone with a large deployment."  The setting should be left in the orderer config struct to avoid this issue.   ></description> </Issue>

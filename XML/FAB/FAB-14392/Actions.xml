CDATA Some things to address: The collection definition gets deployed to the channel at the time of chaincode instantiation (or upgrade). If using the peer CLI to instantiate the chaincode, the collection definition file is passed to the chaincode instantiation using the {{--collections-config}} flag. If using a client SDK, check the  SDK documentation|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/  for information on providing the collection definition.  Instantiateis now  replaced by Approve and Commit.  The topic  CouchDB as the State Database|https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/couchdb_as_state_database.html  describes indexes that can be applied to the channel’s state database to enable JSON content queries, by packaging indexes in a {{META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes}} directory at chaincode installation time. Similarly, indexes can also be applied to private data collections, by packaging indexes in a {{META-INF/statedb/couchdb/collections/<collection_name>/indexes}} directory. An example index is available  here|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/META-INF/statedb/couchdb/collections/collectionMarbles/indexes/indexOwner.json .     How does the private data collection get packaged into the .tar file?  ></body> </Action>

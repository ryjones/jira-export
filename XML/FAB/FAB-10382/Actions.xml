CDATA I am trying to install Fabric on Raspberry Pi 3 B+. I have already had a 64-bit Xubuntu installed on the pi, and have built fabric-baseimage and fabric successfully. I saw the two issues you reported before and that helped a lot. But now I have encountered some other issues, if you could help with them, that would be great:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11116  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11117  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello  ~sang , Sorry for not being able to write sooner - I was on vacation and stuck with pretty bad Internet connection.   I have assigned all the bugs you reported to me. The easiest way for me to help you is to direct you to my DockerHub profile where all the images are built already for a 64-bit OS. Next you can pull all your images from here: https://hub.docker.com/u/pesicsasa/. Please use the aarch64-1.1.0 tag instead of the latest tag (Except for the couchdb - for the couchdb use latest).  Example pooling with some tagging and removing:  docker pull pesicsasa/fabric-couchdb:latest docker tag pesicsasa/fabric-couchdb:latest hyperledger/fabric-couchdb:latest docker rmi pesicsasa/fabric-couchdb:latest  docker pull pesicsasa/fabric-peer:aarch64-1.1.0 docker tag pesicsasa/fabric-peer:aarch64-1.1.0 hyperledger/fabric-peer:latest docker rmi pesicsasa/fabric-peer:aarch64-1.1.0   Regarding the OS, I would suggest you to use the OS from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/bamarni/pi64, Lite version. It leaves a minimal RAM/CPU/Storage fingerprint, if you do not mind not having a desktop - which you do not really need for operating docker containers, cloning repositories and running code.   If you would like I can also take a look at each of he bugs you supplied and help you through solving them - if you want to build the images by yourself.   Greetings, SP   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="48801" issue="30624" author="sang" type="comment" body="Thank you so much for providing the images! I could help with the support for AARCH64 too. I have already successfully built fabric-baseimage and fabric, but not fabric-ca. If we want to install Fabric on RP3, do we only need to successfully build the three files, or are there other files that we need to build?" created="2018-08-13 19:17:21.0" updateauthor="sang" updated="2018-08-13 19:17:21.0"/>

Well, that depends what components do you want to run on your RP. If you want ca to run on your RP, you would need to build the fabric-ca image. So for a fully functioning Hyperledger Fabric node you would have to run a CA, an Orderer, and a Peer. Solo orderer is OK when you test, and leaves a small CPU/RAM footprint, but the Kafka orderer leaves quite big CPU/RAM footprint and that can probably not run on your RP. Also, it depends on what state DB you prefer. Peers come with the Level DB, but if you want to utilize the rich querying that Couch DB brings, you would have to run it as a container as well. We can also discuss this outside JIRA - write me an email to sasha.pesic@vizlore.com. The issues should anyways be closed.   ></body> </Action>

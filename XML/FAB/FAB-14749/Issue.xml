CDATA The current BYFN tutorial allows you to install a chaincode on a third peer, and join it the channel after it has been instantitated.  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html#install   Â   With the the new Fabric chaincode lifecycle, this chaincode does not have be the same language, as long as the chaincode definition has been committed. we could install a java or node chaincode on this third peer rather than another golang chaincode. It would be an easy to demonstrate the new capability maintaining the overall flow of the tutorial.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~kchristidis  To me naming it "utils" is the problem. The intent was to keep all the "marshalls" in one place.  An approach to do that would be, for each proto file "f", create "fmarshal.go" where we marshal and unmarshall types generated for that proto file. We can then move the "utils" to "common" which will use those marshall / unmarshall functions to compose higher util functions. This way we still keep the marshaling in one place and in the same place where the go files are generated for proto.   This can be done in a self-contained task.  ></body> </Action>

Status Update * Jenkins and Gerrit have both been installed on the jenkins/gerrit node. This system will serve as the CI node where tests will be ran from.  * There are limited storage resources in the OpenStack test environment, so to start off, we will deploy a 3-node Fabric network. Three of the original nodes provisioned for this effort have been decomissioned: ** worker-4 ** worker-5 ** worker-6  *  ~tongliofcary  has created a  fabric deploy repo|https://github.com/litong01/fabric-deploy  for deploying a Fabric network across multiple nodes using Ansible. This is the technique that will be employed to deploy the multi-node Fabric network across the remaining worker nodes.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To continue the conservation of storage and compute resources on the OpenStack test environment, the remaining nodes originally deployed were decomissioned: * worker-1 * worker-2 * worker-3  The fabric deploy repo was cloned to the runner node in an effort to execute the fabric deploy playbooks against the OpenStack test environment.  After making changes to the vars/os.yml file to match environment specific data,  the playbooks ran, resulting in the deployment of the following nodes: * fabric001 * fabric002 * fabric003  Validation tests are underway to see if the multi-node fabric network was deployed successfully.  ></body> </Action>

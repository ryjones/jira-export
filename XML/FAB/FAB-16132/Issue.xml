CDATA Kafka is complicated to set up and operate, especially when multiple organizations want to run the ordering service. Raft is the best practice for Fabric v2.0, and should be the only option in the BYFN sample going forwards. This task will remove Kafka from BYFN.  Any users wishing to see how to configure Kafka - support is not being removed AFAIK - should consult previous tagged versions of the BYFN sample to see how it was done previously.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Fabric now supports adding capabilities via Go plugins in 3 areas: - bccsp - auth filters - system chaincode  In order for all of this to work and for there to be no non-determinism, careful thought and planning needs to go into distributing peers with the plugins.    Given that, the default build for a peer should not include the ability to deploy / use plugins.    For that reason, we will add a build tag for plugin support and by default we will build the peer without the ability to load plugin.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Seems like we have a set of FAQs or at least a few specific repeated ones... some of these should probably addressed by more examples, tests and documentation, but for starters, we can also list a few of these in one easily accessible location, keep it updated and learn from it.  You can use this guide to help you identify and resolve basic problems you may be experiencing with the various configurations of Membership Services (enabling security, key length, registering more than once, etc...)  Later on, we can extend the basic structure and separate to sections, etc... but it'd be good to start with something as a baseline for improvement.  ></description> </Issue>

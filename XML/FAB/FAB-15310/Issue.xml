CDATA Hello,  Two relevant questions: # While peer is reconstructing CouchDB (when peer starts with data but with empty CouchDB). This happens when peer has persistent disk attached but not CouchDB  ** is it safe to use peer?  ** otherwise how to detect this situation and do not send traffic to peer? maybe (if not already in place) *peer node status* should return a proper message which can be used as *readiness probe* and do not send traffic to peer? # When using Kafka orderer, are we safe by not attaching persistent disk to orderer nodes? Experience suggests orderer nodes restore data from Kafka cluster, but is this something we can rely on? ** similar to above, is it safe to use that instance of orderer while restoring data? ** otherwise how to detect this situation and do not send traffic to that orderer instance?   Thanks     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Updating `sarama` should be done on a more regular basis, preferably on each new release of Fabric.   Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)|https://aws.amazon.com/msk  has reached general availability, providing users with the option of picking between Apache Kafka version 1.1.1 and version 2.1.0.  Today the latest version supported by Fabric is Kafka 1.0.0. This isn't even reaching the lowest version that AWS provides. Although Kafka brokers are backward compatible, it's time to upgrade the Kafka client to support the 2.x.x versions.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA > Jason Yellick Could you please confirm if we are expected to support this usecase. I executed the testcase described in FAB-7915  Officially, I believe we would say that the user should restore the backup of the peer that they took before upgrading to v1.1.  However, I see no reason why this should fail, and if it does, I thought it would be worth noting and documenting.  ></body> </Action>

If deleting the chaincode image does not fix this, it is rather perplexing. ---- It is the chaincode conatiner that I was referring above.  Deleting v1.1 chaincode image has no issues. It is as per the test case step 5, we tested this.   *_Downgrade the peer to v1.0.x (do not delete the chaincode image)_*   ></body> </Action>

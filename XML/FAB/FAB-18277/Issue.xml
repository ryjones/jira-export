CDATA While testing ledger snapshotting functionality we encountered a bug within CouchDB. While performing a large range query on CouchDB, Couch encountered a flake and the query was aborted. Couch however reported a 200 response code. Because Couch reported 200 OK, the query was not retried, the response body was read, and the snapshot failed because reading the response resulted in an `EOF` read.  This issue is not reproducible, but we note that the disk was not under pressure, and CPU and RAM utilization were sub-50% according to SysDig.  A bug was already open for this on the Couch repo and we added our information to it as well:  https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3059   We are opening this Jira as a means of reminding us to track this GitHub issue.  ></description> </Issue>

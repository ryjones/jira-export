CDATA The orderer has ClientAuthEnabled  as its configuration key that toggles the TLS service to verify clients, and the peer uses clientAuthRequired.  I think this is a bit confusing and also not uniform, and since we are introducing mutual TLS in v1.1 there is no backward compatibility issues with changing this to be uniform.  I think the required (clientAuthRequired) should be in both, because Enabled makes it sound as if it is a recommendation and not a requirement, though the option clearly makes it mandatory.    ~jyellick   ~kchristidis  opinions?  ></description> </Issue>

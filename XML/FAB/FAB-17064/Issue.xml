CDATA Given that we have integrated cache with the commit path, the commit code has become sensitive. If either the cache is updated incorrectly or accessed incorrectly, we could do a wrong commit. It is possible to add a bug and pass the current unit-test. Hence, we need to perform per function unit-testing rather than only call ApplyUpdates() to cover all functions. For e.g., we need to have unit-test for the following functions: * buildCommitters() * buildCommittersForNs() * getRevisions() * addRevisionsFromCache() * executeCommitter() * LoadCommittedVersion()  and so on. The above list is not exhaustive. We need to identify all such functions in the commit path and add a unit-test.     Note that the above unit-test should cover all error path too.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA -FAB-6189- added the ability to load BCCSP as a Go plugin.  Due to an issue in the Go standard library(  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22175  ), a Go plugin that imports bccsp/factory (directly or indirectly) will not compile. This is because this package includes a method that calls plugin.Open() and due to the issue mentioned above, a plugin cannot call plugin.Open().  A fix for this issue has been merged into the tip of the Go project and is currently scheduled to be included in Go 1.10.  Until this fix is available, we propose to temporarily add a build flag to Fabric to disable BCCSP plugins. This allows other plugins to be built with bccsp/factory in their dependency tree (These plugins could be auth and decoration handlers -FAB-6159,- or system chaincode plugins FAB-6719)  ></description> </Issue>

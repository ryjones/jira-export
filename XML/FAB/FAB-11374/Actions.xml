CDATA  ~harrisob@us.ibm.com   ~rickr  even though we decided to postpone the cc2cc and collection support from v1.3, we still have items that can be done if time permits, so I think that all items but: FABN-842 FABJ-336 FABN-843 FABJ-337 are fair game, though it makes sense for Java SDK to focus on Idemix for v1.3 over service discovery :)    ~denyeart    ></body> </Action>

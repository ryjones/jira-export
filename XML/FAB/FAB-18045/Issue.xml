CDATA When removing ledger data for a channel, if the remove fails or the orderer/peer crashes, the ledger dbs may have inconsistent data and cause unknown behavior.  Although the higher level above ledger may handle failure recovery, it is important for ledger to mark the channel is under deletion so that it cannot be opened/used. This sub-task will take care of the block store, where a temporary file may be added to mark it under deletion.    ></description> </Issue>

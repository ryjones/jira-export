CDATA Thanks for the link. I don't know the history of why the role is called *discover* rather than *serviceDiscovery*, but at least this is consistent with the documented roles in the Node SDK:  https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/release-1.4/global.html#ChannelPeerRoles   The simplest way to use discovery with the Gateway is to omit the *channels* section of the connection profile entirely and just include one or more bootstrap peers for the organization associated with your client identity. This way you don't need to worry about roles and all peers will be assigned all roles by default. See this connection profile for an example:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/v1.4.0/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/connection-discovery.json   The docs and/or samples could probably benefit from reflecting this.  ></body> </Action>

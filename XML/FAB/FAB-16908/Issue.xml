CDATA There in the sample and structure of a connection profile for Gateway in the docs ( https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/connectionprofile.html#sample ) the fifth role of a peer is missing. This role is "discover" and meant to mark the peer responsible for service discovery. Without this role set to true on at least one peer the service discovery will not work.  The other question is why this role is called *discover* ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/NetworkConfig.java#L807 ) and not *serviceDiscovery* ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/Peer.java#L602 ) in the code.  ></description> </Issue>

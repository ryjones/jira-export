CDATA As fabric is moving towards Azure pipeline CI tooling, once it is confirmed, I will work on or request CI team to create azure pipeline for fabric-test repo and system tests.   Also, we have to decide on which environment we have to run these tests. If it is k8s, which cloud and who will provide the k8s environment. Is it IBM or Community?  We can also think of using AWS k8s as fabric CI is planning to run on AWS pool of nodes..  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="64287" issue="40226" author="scottz" type="comment" body="First try out a job in Azure environment to run the k8s cluster tests in IKS. Check if we can establish the security arrangements so we do not publicize to the world our internal network details for the cluster needed in the CI job unless it is secure and viewable only by certain users. If good, then move jobs there for k8ssystest, k8slongrun (using FAB-16760). Finally ensure we can display daily job results for community (which is a bit trickier if we end up having to run the job privately in order to keep private our cluster information)." created="2019-10-03 15:33:40.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-10-03 17:17:19.0"/>

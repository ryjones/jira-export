CDATA * Setup CI environment for System Tests * Create Cluster in IKS environment * Setup Azure Pipeline yaml * Setup Kubeconfig information in the azure pipline. * Create CI Jobs for System tests, Smoke tests.  Split above task into three below phases. *Phase 1*  *Before we start working on CI environment, setup Azure pipeline yaml files with GitHub account. (As a workaround you can try this with fork of fabric-test GitHub account)*  Setup Azure pipeline yaml files for verify and merge jobs. Create IKS cluster/k8s cluster provided by community (assuming that is the chosen option) *Phase 2*  Create Azure pipeline yaml files for system test suite.

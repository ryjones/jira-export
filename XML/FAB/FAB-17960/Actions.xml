<Action id="69613" issue="45212" author="caod" type="comment" body=" ~guoger Â this simply allows a path around having to resubmit the join-block and quickly starts the onboarding process again once the orderer restarts. Also the file repo can be used for removes as well and will also be used for the file ledger resource removal too. Furthermore if the ledger has been created already, the API will reject the same submission until it&apos;s been removed." created="2020-07-02 13:44:22.0" updateauthor="caod" updated="2020-07-02 16:13:39.0"/>

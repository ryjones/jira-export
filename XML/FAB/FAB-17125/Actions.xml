Update: this is easily fixed in BYFN by changing the ORDERER_GENERAL_GENESISFILE env variable to ORDERER_GENERAL_BOOTSTRAP file. However, based on the comment in the newly merged code, the orderer was intended to stay compatible with the old configuration. I'll investigate further whether a change is needed in the orderer config code.  ></body> </Action>

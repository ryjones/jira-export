CDATA Existing release process required manual intervention to trigger release and mulitarch jobs. This required Jenkins permissions to a user to trigger these jobs manually but as per the Linux Foundation team, they don't want to give permissions to anyone outside of LF team.  Proposed Solution:  Create a pipeline script in Jenkins to publish images and binaries from merge job after a Release CR is merged. To do this, we need to add a flag in Makefile to identify a release CR and push images and binaries to nexus and DockerHub. This is applicable to all the releases like fabric, fabric-ca, fabric-chaincode-java, fabric-chaincode-node. This avoids publishing release artifiacts manually and creates a seamless release process.  We can achieve this with Jenkins pipeline flow.  We can include the above approach with what  ~sykesm  was proposing on multibranch strategy.  ></description> </Issue>

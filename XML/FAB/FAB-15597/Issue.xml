<Issue id="40251" key="FAB-15597" number="15597" project="10002" reporter="ales" creator="ales" type="10003" summary="QueryInstalledChaincode should return aggregate info from old and new lifecycle	" priority="3" status="10000" created="2019-05-31 14:54:49.0" updated="2020-06-11 15:31:06.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="53157"> <description><! CDATA The new version of the query should basically attempt to satisfy the query from the new lifecycle; failing that it should return results from the legacy lifecycle. Note that LSCC doesn't have that particular query, so we could just get the info from the results of LSCC.GETINSTALLEDCHAINCODES. This query in the new lifecycle currently returns {code:java} type QueryInstalledChaincodeResult struct { 	PackageId            string   `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=package_id,json=packageId,proto3" json:"package_id,omitempty"` 	Label                string   `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=label,proto3" json:"label,omitempty"` 	XXX_NoUnkeyedLiteral struct{} `json:"-"` 	XXX_unrecognized       byte   `json:"-"` 	XXX_sizecache        int32    `json:"-"` } {code} but the legacy chaincode doesn't have packageid/label, so we might have to create a new proto and return a oneof.  We also need a flag to tell whether the chaincode is currently defined in the new or the legacy lifecycle.  ></description> </Issue>

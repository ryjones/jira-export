CDATA I see the sdk-java tests are failing consistently when we use fabric latest images. but the same working with existing sdk-ava configuration i.e 1.3.0 images. Please see further details on what;s happening with 1.3.0 images on master daily job FABJ-397   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/fabric-end-2-end-daily-master-x86_64/7/   as master daily and e2e jobs are failing with this error, I suggest to disable sdk-java tests for now from these two job types.     ></body> </Action>

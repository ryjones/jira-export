CDATA The byfn.sh script continues to support the "-m <mode>" option, despite admitting that it's only for historical purposes ("muscle memory is powerful"). However, given that "byfn.sh --help" doesn't even mention that option, it seems pointless to continue to support it. It should just be tossed.  In addition, tighten up and update the usage message; make sure it matches the actual script.  ></description> </Issue>

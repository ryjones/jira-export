CDATA In  FAB-1612  new configuration keys were introduced on the `orderer.yaml` file. The ENV vars on the Compose files we use for the orderer-related BDD tests however were not updated accordingly. As a result, all tests would run against the default config setting (read: solo) and the Kafka path would not get tested.  We should also remove all ENV vars from the Compose files when these match the defaults in `orderer.yaml`. This reverses an earlier take on the matter. The thinking behind this change is that we don't need to keep two sets of settings unless absolutely necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

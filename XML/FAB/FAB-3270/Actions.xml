CDATA I revisited this TODO and the overall strategy of not returning error from done() appears fine to me.  Because, the semantics of done() function is limited to take an indication from the client that the client is done with the query helper and any resources can be released.   However, this function better exit on the first error rather than proceeding further. Also, close all the iterators before exit on error.  ></body> </Action>

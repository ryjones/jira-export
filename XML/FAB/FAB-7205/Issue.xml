CDATA As consortium admin/member, we may allow he get some network topology information, e.g., * Channels in the network, including creator, joiner, time, etc; * Orgs in the network, and creating/joining channels, peers, chaincodes, etc.  The only way to provide such complete information can be from the orderer part.

CDATA Took another look at this and I see what's going on. The negative test here for "ProposalResponsePayloads do not match" succeeds because the test was attempting to receive an endorsement for the commit step from not just org1 and org2 (who did approve the definition) but also org3.  I've modified the test locally and everything works as expected in the case of an incorrect package id set by an org while approving. I think we can abandon this test case which, from looking at the change history on the behave tests, appears to be based on the days when we required that the chaincode package hashes match across orgs.  ></body> </Action>

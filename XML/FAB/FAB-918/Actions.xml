CDATA Thanks for reporting this and looking into it.  (Do you have a better alternative for dealing with YAML files? The most relevant discussion I can think of is this one https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-50, but it discusses alternatives to the YAML format.)  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="19587" issue="13249" author="jyellick" type="comment" body="I really think the key is that we need to upgrade our version of Viper.  When I submitted the config, I noted an issue on Github about the improperly handled nested config for env overrides.  I know this has been fixed since, and I suspect there are other bug fixes lurking out there which have yet to bite us." created="2016-11-01 13:21:40.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2016-11-01 13:21:40.0"/>

CDATA Jason, if you'd like to redo the config handling based on a new version of Viper it's OK with me, I can drop my proposed fix.  Some of the original arguments about alternatives to Viper are documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/fabric/issues/1309 As I mentioned there I think it would be helpful to have 2 YAML files: One read-only file documenting all config. options and their defaults, and another with the user's overrides.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA It would probably be worth writing up a help wanted JIRA item for the config work, but I don't have the cycles to implement this at the moment.  I +2-ed your changeset because it fixes a current bug, is simple, and I have no real time-table for when the viper upgrade might happen, so I would not suggest you abandon your changeset.  ></body> </Action>

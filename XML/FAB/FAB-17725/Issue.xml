CDATA Chaincode install of a chaincode with go.mod set to 1.14 leads to the following error: {code:java} Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image build failed: docker build failed: Error returned from build: 1 "go: inconsistent vendoring in /chaincode/input/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/chaincode/abstore/go: 	github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go@v1.0.0: is explicitly required in go.mod, but not marked as explicit in vendor/modules.txt  run 'go mod vendor' to sync, or use -mod=mod or -mod=readonly to ignore the vendor directory {code} {{}} This is because we don't package vendor/modules.txt within the chaincode tar file when it is needed for the build to succeed in Go 1.14 as described here:  golang/go#37948|https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37948   We can avoid the problem by sticking to the go 1.13 spec in go.mod for now but that's not a long term solution.  ></description> </Issue>

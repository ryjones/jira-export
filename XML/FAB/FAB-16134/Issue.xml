CDATA This task will remove the deployment and testing of the ABStore chaincode in BYFN. BYFN is a network sample that should demonstrate how to start and operate a basic Fabric network; it is not a sample intended to demonstrate the ABStore chaincode.  Any users wishing to deploy and test the ABStore chaincode will continue to be able to do this after starting BYFN by using the CLI or the SDKs to deploy the chaincode.  ></description> </Issue>

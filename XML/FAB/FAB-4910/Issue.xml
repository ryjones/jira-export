CDATA We should probably have a more "generic" and reusable JIRA ticket for this (maybe an Epic with a few tasks, one per release or so), but just quickly:  For people who would like to add notes to the release, we can either have them appended here, or in a Google doc. Whatever people find more convenient. Chris and I will try to combine them, and add ours (e.g., some last minute errata ;),.).. but let's first have all the data/info captured.  For context, we are "pre-pending" these here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/releases.rst   A shared Google Doc for those who prefer that: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zRtJGPDnvqx54Ead6jBSTc86C4IPIwi-_qQT0UOzre4/edit?usp=sharing     ></description> </Issue>

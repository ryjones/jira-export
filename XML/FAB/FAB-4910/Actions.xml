CDATA FAB-4894  The peer communicates with its chaincodes via `chaincodeListenAddress` configuration in `core.yaml` file. This connection is not TLS-mutual auth, so it is strongly recommended to assign a protected address to `chaincodeListenAddress` in production environment to ensure no external entities may connect to this address.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA FAB-3535  If using CouchDB, the password configuration `LEDGER_COUCHDBCONFIG_PASSWORD` is recommended to pass as an environment variable. If stored in the `core.yaml` file, the file must be access control protected to prevent unintended users from discovering the password. Ideally, permission to launching the peer executable, couchDB, access to the couchDB socket and access to `core.yaml` must only be granted to a trusted user group to administer the Fabric environment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA FAB-4824  A client application registers with a peer in the same organization (same root CA) to receive events. That is, the peer is trusted not to forward client's event registration request to other peers to impersonate the client, or to leverage event-related client requests to escalate its access rights in any way. This assumption must hold even if the peer is revoked by its organization.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA * When setting up a peer that is to be used as anchor peer, always define an  external endpoint|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L158  for that anchor peer. An external endpoint is an endpoint (host:port) that is reachable from foreign organizations.  * Never set up a  bootstrap |https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L91 peer to be an endpoint of peer(s) not from your orgs, this would *not* work (it's written in the core.yaml though, not 100% sure if it's needed to add to the release notes)  * Do not use the same certificate for different peers, always use a unique one for each peer.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA ok, so I had NO idea that this even existed, because it was not linked to the release JIRA task.     For reference, there is a file release_notes/<release>.txt that we can and should use for this. If you have some recommended text, then create the file and/or edit it and just leave the date etc blank. However, once we tag the release, it is too late to change this, because it is permanent https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc1  ></body> </Action>

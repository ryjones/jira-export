CDATA I installed go via tarball to my ubuntu following this tutorial.   https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball   But no matter how when I attempted to run:    {code:java} .../fabric$ sudo make clean {code} Error prompt like:    {code:java} Makefile:77: *** "No go in PATH: Check dependencies".  Stop. {code} I investigated line 77 in Makefile which checks whether necessary executable exist and found this flaws.   The go installation guide said recommended GO path is  /usr/local/go/bin   But the checking mechanism cannot detect that.  I added a symbolic link to fixed it successfully.    {code:java} sudo ln -s $(which go) /usr/bin/go {code} Hope there will be an improvement.     ></description> </Issue>

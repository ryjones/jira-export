CDATA Acceptance criteria:  # User edits {{configtx.yaml}} so as to have a network with a single-node etcd/raft-based ordering service and a system channel that is also an application channel. Assume {{BatchSize}} is set to 10 and {{Batch.Timeout}} is set to a reasonably high value, e.g. 120s. # User launches single-node etcd/raft-based ordering service. # User invokes the Broadcast RPC to send {{BatchSize}} transactions ({{foo-1}} to {{foo-10}}) to the ordering service within {{Batch.Timeout}}. User receives a SUCCESS response for each of those calls. # Once {{batch.size}} transactions have been sent successfully to the ordering service, user invokes the Deliver RPC and receives the genesis block and a block containing transactions {{foo-1}} to {{foo-10}}.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Generate connection profile for the fabric network launched in NL in order for clients such as PTE to consume it.  In the NetworkLauncher input file tools/NL/k8s/templates/networkspec.yaml, we should consider adding a new path/location parameter (e.g. conn_profile_path) to specify where the connection profile will be output. (Maybe the default path provided in this file could be the NL/k8s/ directory itself.) And of course the tool code in tools/NL/k8s/go/networkLauncher.go should read and use it.   ></description> </Issue>

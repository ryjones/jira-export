CDATA First, use fabric-test/tools/NL/gen_PTEcfg.sh to create a connection profile for local host, see example in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/31366/ for connection profile based on the network input yaml file, given in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/31359/  Later, we need to to create connection profile for kube environment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA REVISED plans: Write a new function inside networkLauncher.js, to perform the same duties as gen_PTEcfg.sh, to be called from main thread in networkLauncher.js (with an argument representing the network config information). It should generate a yaml version of connection profile, which could be used by PTE or any other admin or traffic tool to read in the network connection profile and run tests against the network.  That said, we are also considering an alternative to write a "GO" language version on networkLauncher instead of nodejs, so we should wait until decision is made.  ></body> </Action>

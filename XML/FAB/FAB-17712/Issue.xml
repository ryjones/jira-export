CDATA Currently in order to create a channel one needs to issue a config transaction to the system channel. This has *privacy, scalability* and *operational* disadvantages, since the system channel (and the orderers running it) is aware of all channels and of all channel members (at creation time).  In this feature we propose to expose a "channel participation" API that would allow a local orderer administrator to *join* and *leave* a channel, as well as to *list* all the channels that the *local orderer* is part of. This allows a Fabric network to be operated *without* the use of *a system channel*, which improves the privacy and scalability of the ordering service and the network as a whole. It also alleviates some of the operational problems associated with the current style of channel creation.  This feature is described in an RFC titled "Channel participation api without system channel" ( currently PR #24|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/24 ).  This feature was presented in a  Fabric contributor's meeting|https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Contributor+Meetings+2020  on April 1st 2020, the presentation is here:  ^Channel Participation API - community call - 1Apr2020.pdf .     ></description> </Issue>

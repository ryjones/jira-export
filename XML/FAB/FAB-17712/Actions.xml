CDATA I like this new enhanced feature, which resolves several issues in the OSN and channel management currently (have to handle these issues by adding similar changes before it).   A quick question in practice:  Will this enhancement break the compatibilities on existing 2.x OSNs that have local ledger already?  If so, we need a similar migration steps as the kafka --> raft one?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is planned to be 100% backward compatible to networks (OSNs) that work with a system channel. That is, the two modes of operation are supported, but not simultaneously in the same network. That is - an OSN network with a system will continue to operate normally with this in place. New OSN networks will be able to choose between the two modes of operation.  There will also be a "migration" path for a network running with a system channel to remove that channel and start operating with the channel participation API. (see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17965). In addition, we also plan to provide a flow for starting with an empty network and creating the system channel with the channel participation API. From then on, the system will operate with a system channel as normal. This eases the task of provisioning an ordering service for some cloud providers (see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-17911).  ></body> </Action>

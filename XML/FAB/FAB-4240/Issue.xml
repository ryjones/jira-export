CDATA As a rich query user, I need an instruction to guide me on writing an ad hoc rich query string to get the query result effectively.  When I use this shim interface GetQueryResult ( shim, queryString), I have created the couchDB select string but I have faced an issue to get the query result back.   I have had a discussion with Dave Enyeart today and discovered that Fabric shim implementation has created a wrapper string based on end user's query string.  The wrap string is automatically adding some field and prefix to the user query string.  This has caused the problem if user's query string includes below data. # header data # no data prefix required in the user data field.  This needs to be clearly documented to save the end users time cost.     ></description> </Issue>

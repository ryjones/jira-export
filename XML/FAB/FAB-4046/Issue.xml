CDATA This is a overarching task to cover UT for various peer components.  Please pick a task with "help-wanted" label or create a sub-task for a package you want to work on (list of packages attached in peer_coverage.xlsx) and assign to yourself. If you need help getting started ping maintainers (or anyone else!).  *IMPORTANT - use the unique sub-task FAB number in the gerrit (don't use the the main FAB-4046).* {code:java} Some simple instructions to find out coverage in a package. They involve running "go test". Some "go test" may need some "ldflags" to be passed.  To get this, do "make peer" from fabric/ folder. Locate "-ldflags...." option from the output from "make peer" and copy it.   To get coverage for a package ...  cd to/the/package/dir go test -ldflags "copy_the_rest_of_ldflags_here" -coverprofile=coverage.out go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html  Explore coverage.html in a browser. {code}  ></description> </Issue>

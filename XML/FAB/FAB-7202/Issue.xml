CDATA One test case for upgrade â€“ we should make sure that the new binaries work with the old config files. Some new mandatory config fields could cause problems if unset. The one that made me think of this is the new timestamp checking on transactions. I saw a log where it was complaining that the timestamp was more than 0s from the current time so was being rejected. I'm hoping this was simply a misconfiguration, but I'm concerned it may have been a default.  {color:#000000}Generally speaking though, if a user cannot simply use their existing config file and expect things to work, we need to document it (as was done for the ORDERER_KAFKA_VERSION) (and I think the only way we can discover these problems is through test){color}  ></description> </Issue>

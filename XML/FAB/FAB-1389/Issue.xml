CDATA Current GetRows function returns rows which matches the key (Key could be composite key). There is no provision to obtain rows between range of keys. I would like to see API to fetch range. The code should look like below. (Note: this is not tested code) Due to formatting issues, code is removed and chaincode.go file is attached. Please look for functions GetRows, GetRowsRange and getRowsInternal  ></description> </Issue>

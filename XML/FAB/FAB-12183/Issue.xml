CDATA Current release of Fabric uses LevelDB as HistoryDB, and provides the GetHistoryForKey API to iterate over historical transaction data for a given key. when users trying to do data analysis or data mining on historical transaction data, there usually exists an urgent need for rich query functionality.  The basic idea under this proposal is to use CouchDB as the HistoryDB to store blockchain metadata (such as block number and transaction number), then rich query functionalities could be achieved on the basis of CouchDB features.  The prototype source code for this proposal is currently available at  https://github.com/yw-liu/historycouchdb-hyperledger-fabric   ></description> </Issue>

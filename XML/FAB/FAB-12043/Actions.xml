CDATA So as to not impact the existing deliver services, a new rpc could be added for DeliverWithPrivateData: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/events.proto#L59-L70  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Talked to  ~denyeart , do not need to add DeliverWithPrivateData support to CLI. See Dave's comment below.  The CLI fetch command is typically used for administrative functions like getting a config block. The block with private data is intended for use by applications, not administrators, therefore we need good SDK support rather than CLI support.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Configuration is manual  as it's a matter of editing server.properties # Assume all brokers use one certificate authority so we have one CA cert distributed to all brokers # Create cert for broker and sign with CA # add broker cert and CA cert to keystore # add CA cert to truststore # add CA cert for client orgs to truststore # in server.properties, set following values: # # listeners=SSL://host:port # # ssl.client.auth=required # # ssl.keystore.location and ssl.truststore.location # # ssl.key.password and ssl.truststore.password ( passwords in clear text.  Kafka admin will have to secure server.properties) # # ssl.keystore.type and ssl.truststore.type ( kafka docs use JKS. Will need to see what else Kafka supports ) # # ssl.enabled.protocols - TLS v1, 1.1 or 1.2   ( need to decide on what version to recommend ) # # ssl.inter.broker.protocol=SSL  ></body> </Action>

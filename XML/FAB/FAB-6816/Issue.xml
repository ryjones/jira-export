CDATA I have a public channel with write permission to Org1 and Read permission to rest all Organizations, hence the channel configuration policy. A different chaincode installed on a channel (say channel-1) performs a channel-2-channel query access on the public channel (within the same peer node).  It is seen during channel-2-channel access, the write policy is evaluated and hence channel-2-channel query access fails. Problem Example - Org2 is authorized for write-operation on channel-1 but not on public channel. This endorsement proposal is marked as failed due to write-access check on public channel.  As far as we rememberer, there was always read-access support enabled by Hyperledger Fabric during c-2-c access operations. Is this a defect?  ERRO 006 Failed to invoke chaincode. Got error: Failed evaluating policy on signed data during check policy on channel  public  with policy  /Channel/Application/Writers :  Failed to reach implicit threshold of 1 sub-policies, required 1 remaining   Note: I tried even performing writes in our public chaincode during c-2-c operation (after giving write permission on public channel to Org2) but this was never see in the public ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

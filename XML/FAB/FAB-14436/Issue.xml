CDATA The following test:  {color:#4c4c4c}EndToEnd reconfiguration and onboarding {color}when an orderer node is joined {color:#ff0000}* It  isn't influenced by outdated orderers* {color}  in integration/e2e/etcdraft_reconfig_test.go fails frequently in integration testing. There are 3 occurrences of this failure in the first 2 pages of open CR's on Gerrit. I've run up against it 3 times myself today.  Locally, the test takes 53 seconds to run, it has a 60 second timeout, which when run in Jenkins is extremely flaky given the small margin of error. It is very easy to replicate, if you simply focus the test, and do a `go test -count=2` I get the error every time locally.  ></description> </Issue>

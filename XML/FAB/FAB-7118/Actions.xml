CDATA Further work on these subtasks are *blocked* until the following questions are answered/delivered: * API docs for mutual TLS * process for enabling on an existing network when TLS was initially turned off * clarification on certificate requirements (flags, etc) * what are the expected behaviors when there is a mismatch between nodes? Expected error messages? * What is expected behavior when a channel is updated to have TLS enabled? * orderer ENV var?   ></body> </Action>

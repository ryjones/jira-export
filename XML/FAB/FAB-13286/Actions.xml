CDATA This is a CPU utilization issue,. When the CouchDB is busy doing index rebuild, the CPU usage is already high, then the incoming endorsement requests and commits start aking up more CPU and queueing up and at one point, Couch container does not complete commit within timeout, and peer panics given that it has a frozen state DB.  This needs to be documented that index rebuilds may take large CPU shares, and prod networks might want to take a note of it to determine, say, the best time for for an index rebuild.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Acceptance*: A simulated client submits to the prover service an atomic swap proof request. The prover peer retrieves the proof request and rejects if the request is malformed, i.e.,Â  * it is not signed by a writer of the channel * it does not preserve the structure designated to atomic swap requests  The prover peer should return to the simulated client a pre-cooked TokenTransaction with atomic swap content.  ></description> </Issue>

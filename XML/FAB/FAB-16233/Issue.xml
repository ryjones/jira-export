CDATA The original issue was that unit tests in orderer/common/cluster would be timed out and panic after 20 minutes. Many of the older logs will highlight this condition.  Since opening the issue, two changes have been made that may impact how this condition is identified. 1. The tests in the package are no longer executed in parallel. When tests were in parallel, the number of active go routines made it difficult to find the root cause. 2. The common cause of the timeout (blocking receive on a channel with no expiration) was changed to receive against a timer. This caps the timeout at one minute. When this timer hits, it is reported as a panic with the "timed out waiting for seek assertions to receive a value" message.  ></description> </Issue>

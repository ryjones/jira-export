CDATA Currently core.yml uses the latest docker images for the javaenv & nodeenv chaincode runtimes.  With the general move to not use latest on docker images, this will need to be updated.   The proposal is that the version be the first two version digits of the fabric version.  i.e .1.4 or 2.0  This means that the patch level of the chaincode - fabric aren't tightly coupled - but they aree at the second level.     This needs resolving prior to GA  ></description> </Issue>

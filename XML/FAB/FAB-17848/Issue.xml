CDATA *fabric-samples* has a fabcar sample as an external chaincode in *chaincode/fabcar/external*.  This sample is useful for understanding the external chaincode.     However, it may be not easy for Fabric beginners to run the sample with the right settings by only reading the documentation and the instructions in this sample.  I think that the reasons are as follows: - There are not end-to-end instructions (or tutorials)  - *fabric-samples* does not provide scripts to run the sample directly     Therefore, we propose to add an option to use the above sample to *test-network* to easily try external chaincode features.  ></description> </Issue>

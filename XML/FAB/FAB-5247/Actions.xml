Especially in a permissioned blockchain it makes sense to detect such inconsistencies caused by potential cheating, even if there is no technical means of automatically recovering from such an event (because the truth is unclear).  To me (cross-organization) gossip seems to be a good means to detect the inconsistencies.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I think it's a great idea, and can be very effective if combined with a feedback mechanism such as: * The existing events framework * A system that parses log files and ships them to a dashboard (i.e the ELK stack) * Sending the event to a telemetrics/monitoring system that can alert the organization  ></body> </Action>

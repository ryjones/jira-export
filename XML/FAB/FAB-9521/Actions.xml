CDATA {quote}There are vars which have matching packages functions which should be public constants{quote} What happens if the variable's type is struct though? We cannot have const structs in Go.  I understand the concerns behind having a default object that is mutable, but I would point to {{DefaultClient}} and {{DefaultServeMux}} in the standard library as examples of exported variables for default objects. https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#pkg-variables  Still looking for what the right, idiomatic way to do this in Go is. And if anybody out there has a pointer to a reference implementation, I'd love to see it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Context:Â https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=qHiyDCX56g8rzhr5x  As part of the 1.0 release, one of the things that has been requested is an FAQ. I believe that we can use the following document for this purpose:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/welcome . One thing that I see missing from this document is something that highlights the differences between v0.6 and v1.0. Is this documented somewhere that we can pull into the FAQ (even if just as a link)?  ></description> </Issue>

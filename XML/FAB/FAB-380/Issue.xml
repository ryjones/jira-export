CDATA During state transfer of a state snapshot, one peer sends its full world state to another.  The receiving peer puts messages into a buffer, but in fast systems, the receiving peer may not be able to keep up with the pace of the sending peer.  For this reason, the snapshot channel was created with a buffer, but, there is no feedback in place to slow transmission when the buffer fills, and for sufficiently fast systems with large world states, available RAM will be exhausted before the channel is large enough to handle the whole transmission.  The state snapshot transfer code needs to provide flow control to prevent this buffer overflowing and transfer aborting.  ></description> </Issue>

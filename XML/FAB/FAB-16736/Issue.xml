CDATA Transient store PurgeByTxID deletes all the entries in the transient store that are associated with the given TxID. However, in a remote case, there could be more than one transactions with the same TxID and the `PurgeByTxID` may end up deleting the unintended entries in the transient store.  One option is that the transient store returns an identifier with each result and the private data provider passes that back with the purge command so as to make sure that only entries that are deleted are the one that are consumed by the private data provider.  Not purging the unused data has a downside that this requires the transient store to keep the unwanted data for long (till retention period). However, in practice, both the scenario should be a remote possibility and hence perhaps better to prefer the prevention of data loss.

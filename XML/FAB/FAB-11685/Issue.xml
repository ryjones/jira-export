CDATA The chaincode shim still uses go-logging for compatibility reason and is still subject to all of the data races in that package. In production, this shouldn't be a problem as chaincode runs in its own process but it  does impact tests.  Work around the racing by making logging setup run exactly once in the tests; change the logging related tests to use an unexported function.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The sample delivery client for the orderer ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release/orderer/sample_clients/deliver_stdout)  can be reused as-is to connect to the deliver service on a peer. However, it will be more user friendly if it is moved/copied into fabric/examples and has a few names changed to make it clear that it is compatible with the peer. It should also work with TLS enabled and have a readme to describe the basic functionality.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Our proto definitions use the legacy rpc operation style with an empty block. {code} rpc GossipStream (stream Envelope) returns (stream Envelope) {} {code} An alternative, that appears more widely adopted, uses a semi-colon statement terminator instead. {code} rpc GossipStream (stream Envelope) returns (stream Envelope); {code} We would like to standardize on the semi-colon terminated rpc declaration.  In addition to updating the proto definitions, the bindings should also be updated with {make protos}.  This is a good CR for a new contributor; it's simple and can be used to understand the contribution process.  ></description> </Issue>

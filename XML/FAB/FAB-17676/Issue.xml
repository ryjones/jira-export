CDATA We have introduced the cache implementation in the  statedb package|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb  as the initial plan was to integrate cache with both  statecouchdb|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb  and  stateleveldb|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/stateleveldb . However, we have decided to defer the cache integration with stateleveldb as the expected improvement would be <5% and further, the goleveldb is not a bottleneck as of now.  Hence, we move the cache implementation to the statecouchdb package itself. When there is a need to integrate cache with goleveldb, we can move it back.  ></description> </Issue>

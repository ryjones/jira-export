CDATA The endorser.go file recently underwent some refactoring.  The refactor thread however didn't have time to address the log statements.  There are lots of 'entry/exit' style logs and confusing conventions like 'chaincode-name/channel'.  Probably, we should be creating a logger for a request that has the request context like address,channel, chaincode, etc. at the beginning and wiring that through.  We should also evaluate whether all of this logging is necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

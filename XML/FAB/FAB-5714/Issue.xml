CDATA Fabric at the moment have a deficit in samples for the financial industry. work is needed to study how Fabric may be used in financial markets for different types of assets and securities.  Some of the scenarios in consideration: * Fixed income assets: Commercial paper * Equity assets: private equity * Derivatives: Interest Rate Swap  h1. Design Details h2. Interest Rate Swap (IRS)  Company A and B sets up an IRS contract with the following terms: {quote}(Source:  https://academlib.com/14298/economics/pricing_interest_rate_swap ) Party A and Party B agree to exchange an interest rate that varies from period to period, specifically 3-month LIBOR (hence, it's the “floating” rate), for a fixed rate of 3.40% on a quarterly basis for two years. Net settlement payments are in arrears, meaning 3-month LIBOR is determined at the beginning of the period and then a payment for the rate difference, times the _*notional principal*_, times the fraction of the year, is made at the end of the period. Importantly, there is no exchange of principal at initiation or at maturity. That's why the principal is merely “notional” – it's the scale factor for the transaction. In this case, the notional principle is set at $60 million.  !https://academlib.com/imag/econom/smith_bondm/image303.jpg!  *FIGURE* Two-Year, Quarterly Net Settlement, Interest Rate Swap 3.40% Fixed versus 3-Month LIBOR {quote} The entire lifecycle of the trade will be executed with the following transactions: - the general terms of the IRS contracts are modeled by chaincode (written with Hyperledger Composer) - admins of A and B each install the chaincode on their peers - admins from either of A or B creates a channel dedicated to trading activities b/w the two parties, or selects one from an existing channel b/w A and B - admins from either A or B submits a transaction to instantiate the chaincode, which gets endorsed by peers from both parties and recorded in the channel's ledger, during the instantiation, the following specific terms of the IRS trade are configured: ** identity the payer of the fixed interest rate (Party A in the example above) and receiver (Party B) ** fixed interest rate is set to 3.4% ** notional principle amount is set to $60 million ** payment intervals are set to 3 months ** maturity is set to 2 years - at this point the trade has been executed and the terms are in effect - at each net settlement, which is the end of the month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, LIBOR rate is taken (from a standard oracle service, but in our case we'll simply call the LIBOR API and pass the historical timestamp for the rate). note that we don't use an oracle service because the LIBOR API is deterministic, the same rate already returned for the same historical timestamp - once the settlement is performed at month 24, the chaincode is marked as "COMPLETED" and will not perform any further settlements  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the  statedb|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb  package, we have the implementation of both  stateleveldb|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/stateleveldb  and  statecouchdb|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb . The interface implemented by the these packages do not include any API related to private data as it is not needed. For the db implementation, both public and private data is a KV pair.Â   The  privacyenabledstate|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/privacyenabledstate  package was introduced to implement a common db interface (i.e., common to both stateleveldb and statecouchdb). Further, this interface also included APIs related to private data.   We really don't need these two separate packages privacyenabledstate and statedb. Hence, we merge both of these packages into a single statedb package itself.  ></description> </Issue>

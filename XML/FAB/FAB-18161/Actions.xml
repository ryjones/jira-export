<Action id="70563" issue="45825" author="manish-sethi" type="comment" body="As we are leaving the coordination of snapshots sharing outside the fabric code, it&apos;s not very clear on the benefits of signing the snapshot by the peer signatures. For now, we leave this to admins to take a call on their trust factor and if they need signatures, the admins can sign the singable_metadata file. We can revisit this, if we hear some feedback on this once people start using snapshot feature." created="2020-10-26 17:39:14.0" updateauthor="manish-sethi" updated="2020-10-26 17:41:17.0"/>

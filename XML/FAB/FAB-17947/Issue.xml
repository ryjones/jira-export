CDATA While trying a few things with the configtx library in the integration tests, I noticed that the signatures created using the package are invalid as pointed out by: {code:java}  e  OrdererOrg.orderer  2020-06-01 20:10:11.924 EDT  policies  SignatureSetToValidIdentities -> WARN 02d signature for identity 0 is invalid: The signature is invalid {code} The integration test has been succeeding because *peer channel update* was automatically adding its own signatures using the existing code.   After some investigation, I have determined the signatures are invalid because the bccsp validation code expects the signature to be on the sha256 hash of the data and not the data itself. We should update the configtx library accordingly.  Follow-on: A subsequent task will be created to modify the *peer channel update* to allow disabling the automatic signature using the local MSP.  ></description> </Issue>

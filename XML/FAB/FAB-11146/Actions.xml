Let me add a bit about the WHY.  Chapter 1 (Introduction) in the docs (1.2) is for decision makers and Fabric architects. Chapter 2 (Getting started) is CURRENTLY primarily for code writers. Chapter 3 (Key concepts) is for Fabric architects, admins, client app dev, smart contract developers Chapter 4 (Tutorial) is for Smart contract developers.  The current chapter 2 could much better be subchapter 4.1. and all chapters move up one position. This would be a more logical sequence of a textbook.    ></body> </Action>

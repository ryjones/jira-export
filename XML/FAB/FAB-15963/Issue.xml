CDATA If attempting to rollback to a block prior to config transactions in an environment upgraded to v1.4.2, the *peer node rollback* command will hit the following error:   {code:java} 2019-07-15 15:56:10.899 UTC  fsblkstorage  Rollback -> INFO 02c Rolling back block index to block number  1  2019-07-15 15:56:10.900 UTC  fsblkstorage  rollbackBlockIndex -> INFO 02d Deleting index associated with block number  2  to  8  Error: Entry not found in index {code}   This is likely caused by config transactions that were not properly indexed by txid prior to the upgrade. See FAB-15411 for background on that issue (fixed in v1.4.2).  ></description> </Issue>

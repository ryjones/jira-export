CDATA I believe each thread/process of PTE sends transactions to a single peer, and verifies the final result of the last invoke sent was successfully delivered and written to ledger of the targeted peer.  To be sure all peers are getting the information, all peers should be queried to ensure they all receive the same result (to prove gossip is working, and non-leaders are getting deliveries too). This should be done for each thread, before final "pass" result can be achieved.  ></description> </Issue>

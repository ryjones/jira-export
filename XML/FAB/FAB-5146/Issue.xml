CDATA After the merge of -------FAB-4626--- ( FAB4904 )-- the client.config emitted by examples/cluster s incomplete for the needs of a well functioning client.  Based on  -----FAB-4626----- a few interpretations of the appropriate output are possible. Towards providing a robust example suitable for a non development environment, the proposal is to:  *Emit a ca certificate and TLS certificate block.*  Towards this effort, unlike the e2e test suite, example clusters ought to use *a set of certs for fabric interaction* and *a separate set of certs, with separate root, for TLS*.  ></description> </Issue>

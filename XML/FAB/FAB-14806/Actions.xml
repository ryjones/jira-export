CDATA  ~kchristidis  yes I did but it did not help.Then I read a temporary solution to create softlink between /opt/gopath and $GOPATH(/home/user/go) and I could get past that error but the new error I see while running make docker is {color:#d04437}"/src{color}/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim" not found in $GOROOT or $GOPATH.  This means that GOPATH is ignored in make command, here path should be {color:#205081}'/home/balee/go{color}{color:#d04437}/src{color}/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim'  but in the error message it says path for the package begins with {color:#d04437}/src..{color}. "/home/balee/go" (GOPATH) should apper before /src  Makefile throws error at following {code:java} GOSHIM_DEPS = $(shell ./scripts/goListFiles.sh $(PKGNAME)/core/chaincode/shim) {code}  ></body> </Action>

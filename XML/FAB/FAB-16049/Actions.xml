CDATA The example02 init function sets both 'a' and 'b' values, so that is a simple usecase of setting multiple key-value pairs. That is used by BYFN, but I could not find it anywhere inside fabric integration tests, however. So, we can search for a UT testcase that I missed, which initializes multiple values in one transaction; but if we cannot find one then we still should cover that testgap in the fabric repositoryt tests (add to either UT or IT).   Note: Once the "init" function is no longer available, chaincode writers will have to create a version of an "add or insert" function to handle bulk-adds if they want to add multiple key-value pairs in one transaction.  The second scenario mentioned (to cover FAB-3857), to pass an empty string, is also something that is not covered elsewhere; it was tested manually, but I am open to reconsidering whether or not that is necessary to automate.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="64570" issue="41369" author="scottz" type="comment" body="The simple cc used by nwo integration tests does in fact use an init function with two key-value pairs, i.e.,  &quot;init&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;100&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;200&quot;. I think we can close this task, as there is not much we can do of much value. Later when the init function goes away, the existing code will have to be rewritten anyways to add a list of key-value pairs with a single transaction using function such as &quot;addpairs&quot;." created="2019-10-11 00:02:47.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2019-10-11 00:02:47.0"/>

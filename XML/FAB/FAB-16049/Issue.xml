CDATA This task is to ensure coverage  for Item 75 of the "Behave Testcases" tab of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIz_E0iFC3lCJGCmXCmRvSYt5yvMhzhSK6Bop0QJOAY/edit#gid=663331741.  The relevant behave test resides in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/blob/master/feature/orderer.feature:  {quote}orderer.feature:Scenario Outline: FAB-3857: <count> key/value pairs in Payloads{quote}      By providing multiple key/value pairs provided as args of an invoke (put) TX, the fabric-test/chaincodes/mapkeys cc can call PutState multiple times, once per each pair of args, within 1 transaction. This test ensures fabric handles all the pairs.  There is no copy or version of the "fabric-test/chaincodes/mapkeys" chaincode anywhere in the fabric repo, and could not find any other test that sets multiple key-value pairs within a single transaction.  A feasible way to do this is to clean up and add mapkeys to fabric/chaincodes/, and add a similar test somewhere - possibly in fabric/core/chaincode/shim/.   IN ADDITION, to easily cover another Behave test FAB-3855, in fabric-test/feature/peer.feature, extend this test being implemented that uses mapkeys chaincode with multiple key/value pairs of args; for one of those key/value pairs, just pass a _value_ arg with emptystring "".   ></description> </Issue>

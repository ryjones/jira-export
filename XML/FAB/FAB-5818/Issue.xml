CDATA Although the MSPConfigHandler has not followed the configtx value interface for some time, it still follows the transactional model of Being/Propose/Precommit/Commit.  This is wrong for a number of reasons now: 1. The underlying MSP Manager is immutable 2. The MSPConfigHandler is only used by immutable config  This CR removes all of the mutable components of the code, drastically simplifying the implementation and reducing the bug surface.  ></description> </Issue>

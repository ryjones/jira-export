CDATA As a consumer of the fabric config API I would like to call a function during my migration from Kafka to EtcdRaft to remove the KafkaBrokers section from my config.  The KafkaBrokers section should normally not be used if the consenter type is etcdraft but this function enables us to support cleaning up migrated configs.  *Acceptance*  I can call a function to entirely remove KafkaBrokers similar to the API function for removing top level orderer addresses. As example is also added/improved for demonstrating how to migrate from Kafka to EtcdRaft.  ></description> </Issue>

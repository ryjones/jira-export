CDATA The peer does not log any information when sending block events from the peer. This is a problem when events that a client (an SDK, for example) is waiting on are not received. Without logging on the peer side, it is hard to tell if the problem occurred with the peer sending the event or if the event was not received/processed by the client correctly.   Example of the updated logging messages, which show the channel, block number, and any transaction ids in the block event: {code} 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  SendProducerBlockEvent -> DEBU 698 Entry 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  SendProducerBlockEvent -> DEBU 699 Channel  mychannel : Block event for block number  1  contains transaction id: 8d74fd3a843ea49fe8f44d7d5c2e74101b43c98cda531962e42925f52fcba3a2 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  SendProducerBlockEvent -> INFO 69a Channel  mychannel : Sending event for block number  1  2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  Send -> DEBU 69b Entry 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  Send -> DEBU 69c Event processor timeout > 0 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  Send -> DEBU 69d Event sent successfully 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  Send -> DEBU 69e Exit 2017-04-14 23:46:55.090 UTC  eventhub_producer  SendProducerBlockEvent -> DEBU 69f Exit {code}  ></description> </Issue>

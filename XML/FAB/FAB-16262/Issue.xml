CDATA v2.0.0 will have the old (i.e. install, instantiate) and new (i.e. approve, commit...) APIs. Tools currently use the old APIs, but should be updated to work with the newer flow (and most certainly before 2.1 when the old APIs may be deprecated).  Some of the newer lifecycle items in node-sdk will be delayed, though, and may not be available in v2.0. Discussions about node-sdk support in fabric v2.0 are ongoing; here are some points stated recently:  * fabric-client (master) supports new fabric v2.0 lifecycle (just a few updates are required based on recent fabric changes). * The intent is to publish fabric-client as a v1.5 release in parallel with fabric v2.0 (target end of September). * fabric-client will be end-of-lifed at v1.5.x. * node.js SDK v2.0 will continue to have fabric-network high level API, but will use a new reworked fabric-base low level API. We'll encourage everybody to use the high level API. * node.js SDK v2.0 release will not be ready by end of September, but that's not a problem - it does not need to coincide with fabric v2.0 release, especially since the v1.5 SDK will have support for fabric v2.0 including new lifecycle. * node.js SDK v2.0 should eventually have support for fabric v2.0 lifecycle (this will largely be a copy of the fabric-client v1.5 lifecycle code). * node.js SDK v2.0 will not have backwards compatibility wrt node.js v1.x SDKs for applications using low level API...we will need to write guidance for users to shift their apps from using low level v1.x node.js SDK to high level v2.x node.js SDK    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Proposal is to add a setInfo() on the simulator, for the chaincode to pass some transaction context that is to be used later for validation in VSCC, without anything getting written to permanent state (therefore don't want to use WriteSet).  This information would get included in the simulation results in the transaction, and VSCC would be able to reference it when performing custom validation logic.  (Murali, please fill in your immediate use case for it).  ></description> </Issue>

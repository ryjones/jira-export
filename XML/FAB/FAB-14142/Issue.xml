CDATA When the list of channels is iterated on in order to enumerate all application channels in the system channel - we start from the block with a sequence of 1, because the genesis block of the system channel doesn't contain a channel creation transaction.  This has an unexpected problem when the system channel has only 2 blocks in it, and a new orderer is onboarded (so the second block is a configuration block, such that we don't have any channels in the system apart from the system channel) - because it results in a null reference panic.  This can be trivially solved by just pulling that block as well.   ></description> </Issue>

Please note: It took 17 seconds for a transaction and it was a simple write operation. The systems are connected using LAN and locally within the organization.  *Orderer Logs* ===> https://hastebin.com/eberafirac.bash *Peers Logs* ===> https://hastebin.com/gowajocutu.md *Chaincode Function that was executed* ===> https://hastebin.com/hihusepoqa.sql   Postman Screenshot !hyp.png|thumbnail!

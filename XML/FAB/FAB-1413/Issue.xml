CDATA The behave tests for the Orderer Kafka service use x86 docker images for both Kafka and Zookeeper, both of which are needed to test the Kafka ordering service.    As a result the behave tests associated the the Kafka ordering service fail for z and p.  I would suggest building upon existing arch-specific docker images that are built during the fabric build process.  ></description> </Issue>

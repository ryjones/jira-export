CDATA ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  B. Things that need updating in the current build / Barry's repo / build:  (I'm omitting from this list, all the "WIP" topics, b/c I think those are well-tracked already / have Jira issues.)  #     Release notes: http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/ #     Nit / low FYI text in "command" table at the bottom too small: http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode/ #     TOC tweaks - a) "Docker Compose" caps. b) Are we going to use the "smart contracts" term – or instead "chaincode applications" only? c) "CP Paper" is redundant. #     Notice – in some cases we point to doc that is NOT in the fabric/docs dir, but in other dirs, such as fabric/dev-setup.... There are some fabric/apis etc. directories also ... These will need some confirmation that the devs have updated their content in there for v1.0 ... e.g. this page still references Vagrant: http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/build/ #     Nit / low ... I don't like use of "the blockchain" ... there is no one "blockchain" that everyone uses. Even on one network, there are mutliple "blockchains" (ledgers with crypto-linked "chain" of blocks). So blockchain is a concept / abstraction, not a physical object. And can be used as a noun - "we're using blockchain" or an adjective - "we're using a "blockchain network". See http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carlease/ ... #     While we're on car lease, let's at some point add title/registration tracking, and renewal / transfer of title/ownership, and insurance and registration renewal and proofs of purchase and not expired status. Also since we're selling the used car, also show me the carfax / vehicle history. #     Usage FAQ: http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ/usage_FAQ/ (esp. "validating node" and the specific error message, which should be moved to Troubleshooting.) #     "Troubleshooting" is currently limited to "Docker Troubleshooting" so it should either be renamed as such, or expanded to include other problems / error msgs. (It's also labeled "optional" ... which isn't really true for those having the problem. - delete "optional".) http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_trouble/ #     TOC - "Multi Channel" - change to "Channels" and point to the new topic. #     "Consensus" WIP http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/consensus/ ... text says that consensus is used as a "broader term than ordering to include the entire transactional flow" ... We should change that text--we don't want to reinvent the established concept of "consensus algorithms" or "consensus protocols." ... I think what we mean here is that depending on the plug-in used for the ordering component, it may or may not be a "consensus" algorithm/protocol. ... e.g. PFBT is a consensus protocol because it solves, to a degree, the consensus problem - which is when message recipients receive divergent conflicting messages, basically. (I'm not certain that SOLO and Kafka are also truly consensus protocols in that they solve the consensus problem - that a protocol orders stuff doesn't mean that it necessarily solves the consensus problem. ... I will have to look into that more.) If all agree, I can take the Consensus topic. #     TOC: Appendix: "Development process and code" is limited to just "Fabric development process and code" so needs a rename. #     TOC: Gerrit heading - there are a number of adjacent topics at same level as Gerrit heading that are also Gerrit topics. #     Contributing - Legal Stuff - we have the signoff, but do we need to add the hooks for the ChangeID? ... (and is that really "legal" stuff? - scary.) http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING/#legal-stuff #     Nit / low - some of our links that take the user to an external site we should be opening a new browser tab for them. - someone goes to an external site, click a few times, and then can't find their way back to us easily. e.g. we link to https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa from http://fabric-rtd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING/#coding-guidelines ... (and while we're there, it's fewer than eight, not less than, in Maintainers.) #   ></description> </Issue>

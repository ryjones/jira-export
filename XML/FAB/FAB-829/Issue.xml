CDATA This item reflects the work needed to design an interface for membership services operations (issuing/managing certificates, and authentication mechanisms using those certificates) in a way that that interface does not depend on the exact implementation/cryptographic primitives that the membership service uses.   This interface is to be integrated to core operations of the fabric, such that a fabric deployer who wishes to substitute only membership service component of the system, is able to do so without affecting the code of fabric core/transaction processing.   Wee need to define one interface used by the infrastructure (verification MSP interface) and one for the client to construct transactions (retrieving the corresponding certificates), and signing with its secret key.    ></description> </Issue>

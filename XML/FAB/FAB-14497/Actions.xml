CDATA The orderer cluster protos clearly define two message types.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/1bd01d8641ab687bff382e98732cb54cf83672f7/protos/orderer/cluster.proto#L22-L30  There are messages related to the consensus protocol ({{ConsensusRequest}} messages) and messages which are simply forwarding ordering requests to the leader. ({{SubmitRequest}} messages).  Because this is a _Debug_ level message, using the correct message type name even though it might be confusing to an end user seems acceptable to me, and I would not consider this to be a bug.  ></body> </Action>

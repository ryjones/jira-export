CDATA I have chaincode which does security checks when security is enabled. It checks if security is enabled through core.SecurityEnabled() api. I enable / disable security using docker-compose env. variable CORE_SECURITY_ENABLED.  This works fine in dev mode. However when I deploy chaincode in non-dev mode, I get core.SecurityEnabled() as false although my env variable is passed as true. I examined the docker containers. Docker container running peer, returns env variable CORE_SECURITY_ENABLED=true on env command. However docker container running chaincode does not have env variable CORE_SECURITY_ENABLED. It would be picking up value from core.yaml which is set as false.   ></description> </Issue>

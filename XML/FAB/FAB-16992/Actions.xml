CDATA The CR that's out there won't cut it since the approach was to return a {{nil}} instance when external buildpacks didn't _detect_ the chaincode. That doesn't work because the VM interface is used to perform the build and the nil that goes back ends up being a typed nil.  So, instead of resorting to crazy hacks, we should probably stop using the interfaces and just use the implementations.  ></body> </Action>

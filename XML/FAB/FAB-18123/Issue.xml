CDATA As the follower pulls blocks beyond the join-block, it needs to continuously apply the channel config from each config block to the BlockPuller. One aspect of the channel config are the endpoints.  It is possible to simply recreate the block puller on every config block. However this is inefficient because it drops the internal buffer that is full of fetched and validated blocks. In order to avoid this we add a method that updates the endpoints, disconnects from  the current connection, but does not drop the internal buffer.   The next invocations of PullBlock will first re-connect, and then pop blocks from the buffer until it is empty.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA BYFN capabilities are not yet atÂ  V1_4_3 or V2_0 level.  Cryptogen is running with Node OU enabled, which no longer populates admincerts directory.  However the orderer and peers without the latest capabilities enabled will not be identifying admins via Node OUs, they will still be identifying admins via admincerts directory. Without the directory populated, BYFN fails with error:Â  {code:java} 12:33:25  34m2019-10-04 16:33:25.720 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 0m Endorser and orderer connections initialized 12:33:25 Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for  Group   /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied 12:33:25 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CDATA in the existing implementation, when adding an org to a collection, the peers on that org will start getting private data only from that moment on.  this will be changed to "full-access", such that, when adding an org to a collection, the org will automatically receive the prior private data for the collection, so that it can query and endorse future transactions.  ></description> </Issue>

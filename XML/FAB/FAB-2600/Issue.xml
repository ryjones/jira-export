CDATA In docker environment, peer and CouchDB start up at same time. If CouchDB has not initialized by the time peer needs it, peer startup will panic. Need to extend retries to handle these race conditions.  This change will update retry timeouts (using a back off approach) and number of retries. Post-beta, there will be a more comprehensive retry strategy, to give clients the ability to specify retry logic (e.g. initial Verification vs Commit vs Endorsement will each want different retry logic).   ></description> </Issue>

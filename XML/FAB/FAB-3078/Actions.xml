CDATA I found the change 8173 is merged, so I took the latest code of fabric-ca. However, changing the REST API prefix to /api/v1/ causes the following exception. 2017-04-25 00:09:00 ERROR HFCAClient:532 - POST request to https://localhost:7054/api/v1/enroll failed with status code: 404.

Could you check if the latest fabric-ca indeed works ok with this change?   ></body> </Action>

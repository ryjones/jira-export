CDATA This is a request for PTE to support rerunning the same testcase on the same network. Use unique key names, logfile names, etc, to avoid collisions. This should be true for rerunning invokes as well as queries testcases. This would be useful to run the same tests multiple times - either simultaneously or over a long time period such as in a long-running network like a live production network.  It seems necessary that PTE would need to create a unique TestRunID; we may wish to also allow the user to specify one, in order for them to coordinate multiple testcases and testruns (e.g. a set of invokes and a set of queries).  You might be thinking "we can already do that!". If so, you may be thinking about the samplecc chaincode,which happens to be designed to allow rerunning over and over. However, other chaincodes cannot be run multiple times, including the marbles chaincodes that are used in some testcases.  With this capability, users would not have to worry about testing and retesting with only certain chaincodes. This will be more useful as we modify PTE to easily execute any pluggable chaincodes.

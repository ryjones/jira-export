CDATA I can't see what this was doing at the time.  There is no fabric code in the log provided.  If `go test` order is deterministic, what's next is  github.com/hyperledger/fabric/gossip/comm	  So it could be some thing in gossip, but it appears to be a failure to start running the next test package. I don't know any reason there would be extremely large by memory to compile or run in these areas.  ></body> </Action>

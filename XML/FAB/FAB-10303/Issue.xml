CDATA Many of our tests and some of our code are still using order based initialization for structs.  This is very brittle and against bad practices.  In an attempt to upgrade the version of protobuf to v1.1.0, all of files in this changeset broke, because the number of struct members in the generated code changed.  Although this does not include any of the proto updates itself, this CR serves as a prerequisite to doing so.  ></description> </Issue>

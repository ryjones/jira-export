CDATA When a new channel is created, one of OSNs in this channel should proactively start campaign, instead of having all nodes passively waiting for ElectionTimeout, which could be 5~10s by default.  -A simplest approach is to have *the node with smallest raft id to campaign*, (since all nodes have this knowledge) so there's no contention.- To deterministically *and* randomly pick one node in channel to campaign, we could pick the node whose id is: {code}id == hash(channel_id) % len(nodes) + 1 {code}  Note, we should modify an existing integration test to check this.  ></description> </Issue>

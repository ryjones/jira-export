CDATA made a minor attempt, and it seems to be more complicated than I expected: - when picked node starts campaign and sends out {{Vote Request}}, it's very likely that other nodes are not ready to receive messages yet, and we regress to long-wait - in order to really shorten leaderless period, we should have a background thread _periodically_ campaign till success, or max attempt, or another node is elected. This adds more config options and complicates code and UT - UT needs to be mildly refactored to accommodate this (start chains and wait for them to be ready to accept messages)  -IMO, this should be deferred after initial release.-  ></body> </Action>

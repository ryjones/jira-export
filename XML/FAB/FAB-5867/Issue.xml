Then, the validator compares version of key in read set against committed version in cache while validating a transaction. This reduces the number of REST API calls between peer and CouchDB during validation to improve performance." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-08-22 11:40:28.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:14:10.0" resolutiondate="2017-09-01 15:24:38.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="39807"/>

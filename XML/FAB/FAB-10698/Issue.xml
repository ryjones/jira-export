CDATA  CI  - Disable fabric and fabric-ca release jobs when a tag is created on fabric and fabric-ca master branch. With release1.2, we have a slight change in publishing docker images to hyperledger dockerhub account.  The proposed change is: # Pull stable docker images (1.2.0-stable) from nexus and re-tag with 1.2.0 image tag # Push these re-tagged images to docker hub on the release day # Execute multiarch script to publish multiarch supported images to dockerhub.  But the release-1.1 and release-1.0 branches are still pointing to old release process.  ></description> </Issue>

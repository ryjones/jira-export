CDATA When using the new lifecycle to install chaincode, if the build fails due to timeout or some other reason such that the "endorsement" fails at the peer, the chaincode package should be removed from the local file system.  This prevents an odd behavior where the invoke of a chaincode that failed to build (during install) succeeds.  ></description> </Issue>

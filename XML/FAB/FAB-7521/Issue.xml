CDATA Since {{ab.AtomicBroadcast}} service was abstracted out to be reused at peer for blocks event service the definition of policy name was introduced as a parameter for deliverer handler, e.g.:  {code} 	s := &server{ 		dh: deliver.NewHandlerImpl(DeliverSupportManager{}, policies.ChannelReaders, timeWindow, mutualTLS), 		bh: broadcast.NewHandlerImpl(nil), 	} {code}  while this introduce a potential problem in light of the RSCC work, since correct policy lookup at peer based on resource name, namely based on the resource there is a lookup for policy name underlined for that resource and later it could be used to lookup the policy itself. While for ordering service this is not the case, since policy derived directly from policy name. Therefore we need to distinguish between these two cases.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi,  While My team is waiting for the answer for 'FAB-15557' , we have been monitoring peers' membership status to detect the isolated peer issue.  Thus my team is using both *prometheus metrics and* *discover cli tool* as monitoring tools to get peers' membership status.**  Then we found out that the number of gossip membership peers from prometheus does not match with a peer's gossip membership list from the discover cli tool.  For example, in a random peer isolating situation I described in the issue 'FAB-15557', the prometheus metrics from the isolated peer showed the value of gossip_membership_total_peers_known is 0. However, at the same time, from discover cli from the  isolated peer showed this peer had all other peers on the network.   In my understanding, if gossip_membership_total_peers_known is 0, then the discover cli from the isolated peer should not show the other peers, but it still shows the other peers when the peer was already isolated(as shown in "gossip_membership_total_peers_known")  So I am wondering why the results are different between gossip_membership_total_peers_known status and the discover cli tool.  ></description> </Issue>

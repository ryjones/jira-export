CDATA This is not a bug unless you are saying that some behavior has actually changed.  Are you referring to the fact that there are override settings for specific modules defined in `core.yaml`?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I was actually just talking to  ~sykesm  about this yesterday after I noticed we're finally using the zap logging package.   What Latitia noted here has been on my mental to-do list for a while (though I kept forgetting to open a JIRA item). The behavior did end up changing a number of months ago when we were having concurrency issues with op/go-logging. The override settings for specific modules don't really work any more, at least not how they were originally intended and that's what Latitia is pointing out here.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~latitiah  I believe a majority of what you reported here will be fixed via FAB-11836. Some of the code that the peer command uses to initialize logging was inadvertently clearing the existing module levels. That created issues at startup as well as when updating levels using the "peer logging setlevel" command.   If you have a chance, can you try out https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/26140/ to see if the behavior is more in line with what you expect? There are still major issues related to logging that may require significant/breaking changes in a subsequent release but I think things will be improved in time for 1.3 with this fix.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The logging level setup is backwards. It acts as if there is a logging variable to rule them all as opposed to a logging level to be used if the others are not set.  This means that if I want to turn off gossip logging, for example, that I must list all the other log levels and NOT set the overall log level (CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL).  This is a usability issue.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  FAB-2024  Add valid indicator to GetTransactionById  When clients retrieve a transaction from ledger, they need to know whether the transaction was validated or invalidated by committing peer.  GetTransactionByID API needs to retrieve the transaction Envelope from block storage, and return it to a client, and indicate whether the transaction was validated or invalidated by committing peer. So that the originally submitted transaction Envelope is not modified, a new ProcessedTransaction wrapper is returned.  ></description> </Issue>

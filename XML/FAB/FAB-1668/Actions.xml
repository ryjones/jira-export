CDATA Solution in this change-set: ----------------------------- For solving this, we can capture the details of the range query (the query and it's results) during the simulation time and re-execute the query during validation time and compare the results. If the results (keys and versions) are still the same, we can safely commit the transaction.  This changes set introduces - Structures for capturing the range query details in rwset - Detection of phantom items (insertion/deletion) that affect the results of the range query during validation - Mark the transactions that are affected by the phantom items as invalid to ensure serializability in the presence of range queries  ></body> </Action>

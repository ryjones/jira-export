CDATA _The following was discussed with_  ~ellaki _,_  ~elli-androulaki _,_  ~adc _._  ~angelo.decaro _,_  ~adc _,_  ~yacovm  _- folks pls correct/expand as you see fit._  A chaincode connects back to the peer on the peer.listenAddress endpoint (by defaultÂ 0.0.0.0:7051).  If this port is not protected, a remote attacker may connect to the peer and impersonate a chaincode during instantiation (or first invocation) by racing chaincode container creation.  If this port is protected (i.e. not reachable from the outside), this attack can still be performed by an unprivileged local attacker (or by a malicious remote attacker with chaincode instantiation privileges).  ></description> </Issue>

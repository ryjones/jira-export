CDATA This Epic combines a set of (much needed!) improvements that are needed in order to make Membership Services easier to configure.  These are needed both statically (e.g., using the membersrvc.yaml file) or dynamically using CLI parameters at launch. In addition, under the same bracket, while extending the configurability, we should also spend a cycle or two on 'house-cleaning', clearing up some of the tests data, and adding a lot more configuration related 'input validation' steps with clear(er)/informative error messages.  We should append/link more items here as we find them... so everybody, please feel free to pile suggestions/issues on.  ></description> </Issue>

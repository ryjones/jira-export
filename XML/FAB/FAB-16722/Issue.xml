CDATA The generation of a system channel genesis block is not a core function of the orderer. Even though it could be somewhat useful in test environments, from a technical perspective, it requires the orderer to include and use the "sample" {{configtx.yaml}} in addition to the orderer's own {{orderer.yaml}}.  From a process and deployment perspective, it's better to have the system channel genesis block explicitly created by administrators with real names than to rely on fixtures that were originally intended for test.  For these reasons, we should remove the provisional genesis method from the orderer, it's associated artifacts, and documentation. The removal should be highlighted in release notes.  Acceptance: code supporting "provisional" is gone, documentation for the feature is removed, and a release note highlighting the removal is created.  ></description> </Issue>

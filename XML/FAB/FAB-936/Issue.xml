CDATA * Had a bug in the gossip tests that made them fail on Mac computers due to different order of stack trace of the testing packages.  * Also made the gossip and discovery tests faster by making the sleeps there sleep only until the next phase is ready instead of sleeping the whole time anyway.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2167/ 2800ab9871adb9c83abe4d0a18239179cb44925e  * Also relaxes some timeouts of the tests because a developer complained they fail on his PC. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/2137/ 5bf0eb18ec017a80852f6c7fd42821e5e3c68eb9    ></description> </Issue>

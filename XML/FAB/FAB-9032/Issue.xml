CDATA FAB-9022 was created to address a compilation issue in one of the samples. The initial fix was incorrect but it never should have gotten that far.  Items that are intended to be samples need to be regularly built and tested and updated to reflect changes with evolving best practices. This issue should be used to either ensure the clients are made part of the build with appropriate testing/validation or removed from the tree as necessary.  Â   It would also be good if the samples were freshened up to avoid (unnecessary) anti-patterns like explicit package init a "main" package.  ></description> </Issue>

Because this license information exists in the documentation, I was expecting to see CC-BY-4.0. I guess we should change this to be more specific and include both licenses (source code and documentation)." priority="4" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-06-26 21:23:18.0" updated="2018-07-20 14:13:36.0" resolutiondate="2017-06-27 13:57:29.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="39280" security="10001"/>

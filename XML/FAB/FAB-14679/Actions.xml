CDATA  ~odowdaibm   ~negupta   ~sstone1  The commercial paper tutorial still uses old lifecycle. Is this on anybody's radar for shifting over to new lifecycle? Nick, minimally I think we'd want to put disclaimers around references to old lifecycle that remain in v2.0 docs, before v2.0 is released.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  Matt White and I decided that we are going to move the commercial paper tutorial to the new test network, and as part of that process, script out the deployment of the chaincode to the channel so that it does not take so much of the tutorial. That will fix issues with the sample and the doc.  Not sure when that will be done. I will add a quick disclaimer to the commercial paper between now and then.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have been playing with it and am running into issues so if y'all are moving it to the new test network, it would be nice to get these looked at.  1) It's confusing to install things to the GOPATH.  If you are not a Go developer you honestly will find this confusing, like a GOPATH is where GO's installed, maybe? Why is fabric-samples supposed to be installed there?  Also why did I install fabric-samples wherever I wanted when I was playing with Fab Car, (which is right before Commercial Paper in the docs) and now have to re-install it at GOPATH?  2) When I downloaded samples with the following command, there was an issue I guess with "Latest" label so I had mismatches. {noformat} curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE| bash -s -- 2.0.0-beta 1.4.4 0.4.18{noformat}  Curl didn't have any issues, but I guess I did not get all the right files, and when i ran start.sh, I had probs. {noformat} ./start.sh  # Create the channel docker exec -e "CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP" -e "CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp" peer0.org1.example.com peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c mychannel -f /etc/hyperledger/configtx/channel.tx 2020-01-16 01:45:07.041 UTC  channelCmd  InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not succesfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating ReadSet: existing config does not contain element for  Group   /Channel/Application/Org1MSP but was in the read set{noformat} I finally got the curl command with the right versions from  ~btl5037  and was able to get the right copies.  The problem is not just the fix, but also how it would be difficult for a new person to figure out that's what the problem is.    {noformat} curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 2.0.0-beta 1.4.4 0.4.18{noformat}       3) Got start.sh to work and moved down to starting the cliMagnetoCorp container and ran into another issue    {noformat} docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d cliMagnetoCorp  Starting cliMagnetoCorp ... error  ERROR: for cliMagnetoCorp  Cannot start service cliMagnetoCorp: b'network e82916a3a6d6a367f92802ce14cdf6bdccfaed381b5a1cc1aea84b03f76dcaac not found'  ERROR: for cliMagnetoCorp  Cannot start service cliMagnetoCorp: b'network e82916a3a6d6a367f92802ce14cdf6bdccfaed381b5a1cc1aea84b03f76dcaac not found' ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.{noformat} Looks like I had an errant cliMagentoCorp container running already??  So my instinct would have been to execute stop.sh (I think that's what I did, not sure of this one, but I got something like    {noformat} Removing network net_basic ERROR: error while removing network: network net_basic id 03bbf0ecac081ec8ea0461c92ae8296f0397c81904a293a5d26dd6e584fcd9a6 has active endpoints {noformat}    so I killed all my docker containers.  Then I went to the magnetoCorp directory    {noformat} docker-compose down   Removing cliMagnetoCorp ... done Network net_basic is external, skipping {noformat} Then again ./start.sh This time things started okay.   4) Moving to magnetoCorp directory.    {noformat} docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d cliMagnetoCorp  Creating cliMagnetoCorp ... done{noformat} Next step, installing Chaincode {noformat} docker exec cliMagnetoCorp peer chaincode install -n papercontract -v 0 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract -l node  2020-01-21 21:18:24.164 UTC  chaincodeCmd  checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 001 Using default escc 2020-01-21 21:18:24.164 UTC  chaincodeCmd  checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 002 Using default vscc Error: error endorsing chaincode install: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = error validating proposal: access denied: channel    creator org  Org1MSP {noformat} Ugh!

CDATA From Matthew White regarding the Commerical Paper sample: The PR has built with running the java,node and golang variants, all with the new lifecycle. The 'quick-start' readme.md in the sample commercial-paper directory has also been updated to reflect the new changes. Previously the tutorial had a mix of both using the cli containers, and local command line;  the flow felt confusing - and plus with test-network using the local apparoach (not the cli) container. I've swapped the README.md to do likewise and the CI scripts. The CI scripts are cumbersome as the is a vast amount of duplication, but functional. I'm going to take the WIP tag off - so any comments welcome.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/109  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hey  ~robmurgai  Addressing your issues one by one with how the updated doc will address:  1. ) No more need for the GOPATH. Removing this section entirely.  2. ) For installation, directing users to the main install page: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html, so users will have the latest method to use bootstrap.sh  3. ) We are adding a script in the commercial paper directory that will start the test network. No CLI container necessary.  4. ) You do not need to use the CLI container to install cc anymore. We provide a script that will set an the env variables that are needed to interact with the test network.  ></body> </Action>

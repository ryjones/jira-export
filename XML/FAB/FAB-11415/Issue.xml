CDATA Today, chaincode install is done on a per peer basis via an install operation performed by the peer's admins.  Per feedback from the Chaincode lifecycle improvements discussion, this becomes challenging to maintain in networks for more peers, and is generally a sub-optimal approach for managing chaincode bytes.  There are multiple possible ways to address this problem. # Chaincode images could be built and distributed externally, through a mechanism like signed docker images. # Chaincode could be pushed onto the blockchain. # Chaincode could be pushed into the private data with hashes on the blockchain. # Chaincode could be pulled via standard URLs with checksums. # Something else?  This epic is being created to track this deficiency and to invite design and discussion.  ></description> </Issue>

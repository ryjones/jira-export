CDATA The peer currently uses the orderer endpoints it obtains from the channel config to communicate with orderers.  If the orderer addresses change, new peers will not be able to join channels as join channel requires the initial configuration block for a channel which will have endpoints which no longer exist.  As a stop gap, we will add an orderer endpoint override section to the peer config.  It will be a map of "old address"->"new address".  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It would be nice to add one more field here, rather than simply:  {code} from: <address> to: <address> {code}  It's probably a good idea to also add:  {code} caChain: <path-to-pem> {code}  If we don't also allow association of a particular TLS CA with an orderer endpoint, then we'd have to fall back to sticking the orderer TLS certs into the local MSP.  But, adding another org's TLS CAs into the local MSP implies a bit more trust in the TLS CAs of other organizations than we want to grant.  Another org could for instance intercept and replay requests to a channel they're not authorized to read.  I'm happy to tackle forward porting this feature to v2.0, but wanted to make sure we're settled on a configuration format first.  What do you think  ~mastersingh24  ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Since there seems to be a flurry of activity on this right now, I guess it's time to comment. While I understand the sentiment behind this, we should not be investing in this.  1. We do not want to be in the business of enhancing and maintaining the peer CLI. The https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-cli was bootstrapped as a formal hyperledger project to address this need. 2. The reason the JSON response is empty is because when the CLI is told to serialize in JSON, it simply serializes the protos in JSON. It's that simple. There's no logic to massage the output for consumption by humans any more than there is logic to massage the proto ouput for humans. 3. The reason the empty field is omitted is because the protoc compiler explicitly tells the JSON marshaller to omit empty fields.  In summary, I don't think enhancing the commands to add special case logic for one or two empty fields makes any sense. The current implementation simply serializes the proto structs as requested.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yeah, the proto compiler omit the empty fields for the “omitempty” attribute. I turn this issue to "TO DO" status, waiting for further discussion.  ></body> </Action>

<Issue id="44005" key="FAB-17405" number="17405" project="10002" reporter="sstone1" assignee="xwu" creator="sstone1" type="10001" summary="Lifecycle CLI omits empty arrays from JSON output" priority="4" status="10100" created="2020-01-16 18:10:10.0" updated="2020-03-15 13:59:19.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="57911"> <description><! CDATA When either "peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled -O json" or "peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted -O json" are called, they output a JSON object that contains the results of the query.  For "peer lifecycle queryinstalled", the JSON output is: {noformat} { "installed_chaincodes":   { ... chaincode1 ... }, { ... chaincode2 ... }   } {noformat} However, if the peer has no installed chaincodes, the JSON output is: {noformat} { } {noformat} This makes it more difficult to build applications that consume this JSON, as you have to cater for the array "installed_chaincodes" potentially being absent. IMO, the array should always be included in the JSON, even it is empty.  ></description> </Issue>

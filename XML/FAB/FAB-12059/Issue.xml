<Issue id="33915" key="FAB-12059" number="12059" project="10002" reporter="dbshah" creator="dbshah" type="10001" summary="Able to pass YAML file as MSP configuration" description="The peer and orderer right now require the certificates to be in msp folder structure. A change in one of the certificates in the msp requires the peer/orderer process to be manually restarted. Can there be an enhancement to the process, where an ability to pass the msp as a JSON or YAML file is added. This way it might be easier to watch changes on that file and restart the peer/orderer process if needed. Also, that way instead of dealing with the msp folder structure, a JSON or YAML format can be defined and folders are dealt with by fabric code and not the user." priority="3" status="10100" created="2018-09-19 19:17:23.0" updated="2019-12-02 14:20:35.0" votes="1" watches="6" workflowId="45231"/>

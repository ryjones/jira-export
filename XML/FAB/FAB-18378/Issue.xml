CDATA Fabric 2.2 made gossip state transfer be  disabled by default|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16435 .   When a peer is a gossip follower, it does not pull blocks from the ordering service, and relies on the leader peer of its organization to forward blocks directly or indirectly.   However, if a peer misses a block and the rest of the peers in its organization advance too much, it will never catch up because its state transfer is disabled.  Of course, setting the peer to be a static leader and disabling leader election solves this problem, however users may upgrade their Fabric version without changing their configuration or deployment scripts, which set the peer to use leader election, or even be static followers.  I suggest to add a warning the will hint users of this problem.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This refers to the implementation of signing identity local interfaces for the client to be able to actually sign a transaction using its long term fabric signing identity. Token client should be able to send requests to a prover peer and submit transactions to an orderer via real grpc client (instead of mocked local interface)  Â   *Acceptance*: Token client is setup using a statically assigned MSP signing identity. Fabric client is able to sign messages (e.g., prover peer signedCommands, or Transactions) using this signing identity and send requests/transactions to prover peer and orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Copying the comments from dup FAB-13280 :    Commercial Paper application document is not sync with sample code. There is not any application.js file in the sample code , and code snippet also need to be change.   https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/application.html   Towards the top of {{application.js}}, you’ll see two Fabric classes are brought into scope: const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require({color:#dd1144}'fabric-network'{color}); You can read about these classes in the  node.js SDK on-line documentation|https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/ , but for now, let’s see how they are used to connect MagnetoCorp’s application to PaperNet. The application uses the Fabric *Wallet* class as follows: const wallet = {color:#263673}new{color} FileSystemWallet({color:#dd1144}'./wallet'{color}); should be  - {color:#569cd6}const{color}{color:#d4d4d4} wallet {color}{color:#d4d4d4}={color} {color:#569cd6}new{color}{color:#d4d4d4} FileSystemWallet({color}{color:#ce9178}'../identity/user/isabella?/wallet'{color}{color:#d4d4d4});{color}  ></body> </Action>

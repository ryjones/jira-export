CDATA The links in the docs for commercial paper do not lead to the file mentioned in the text but rather it goes to the top level fabric-samples github.  Example 1: the first link under this paragraph to file {{papercontract.js}} -  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/smartcontract.html#the-contract-class .     Further, the name of the files mentioned in the docs are not in sync with the files present in the commercial-paper folder in master branch.  Example 2: the file name mentioned later on {{ledgerutils}}.js does not appear in fabric-samples at all.  Example 3:  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/application.html  application.js file does not exist in fabric-samples.     The links should point to actual files in master branch.  Note that the default branch for fabric-samples is currently release-1.3, it will be changed to release-1.4 next week, but we can link to master branch to avoid release specific issues.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We've been using a model where we track the downloads for a given release with a specific bootstrap-<version>.sh script in the scripts/ directory. One for each release.  This could be improved if we simply made the version an argument and pass that in to a generic script, which would default to the current version.  Thus, we can have a single goo.gl short url for tracking all downloads that people can use to download any version we've published.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

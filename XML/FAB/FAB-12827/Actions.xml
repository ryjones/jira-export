CDATA These three lines correspond to the following sequence of events:  # The partition consumer for {{foo/0}} errors. We receive a message from the {{chain.channelConsumer.Errors()}} channel. # In response to that, we set up a listener for subscriptions on that partition. That listener comes with a timeout. (If we hit that timeout, we'll try to re-establish our connection to that partition/channel in a slower, more gentle manner, via the {{CONNECT}} message path.) # We hear back from that listener _in time_, i.e. we receive from the {{topicPartitionSubscriptionResumed}} channel. We reset the timer, and go back to the normal mode of doing business.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The error that sarama spits out is: " response did not contain all the expected topic/partition blocks|https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/blob/46cf3e2cf1acef7876068f66cf69ec31aad2d0b2/errors.go#L17 " ({{ErrIncompleteResponse}}).  See  issue 1087|https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/issues/1087  which seems partly relevant. What throws me off is that both folks affected by 1087 had log compaction enabled, which is expected to break the continuity in message offset. This is _not_ the case for us however.  ></body> </Action>

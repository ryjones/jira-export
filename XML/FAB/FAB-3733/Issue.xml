CDATA After recent updates to e2e_cli scripts, it does not work if the optional CouchDB state DB is enabled by following the directions.  The error message is: {code:java} ERROR: Cannot extend service 'peer0.org2.example.com' in /home/adnan/work/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/e2e_cli/base/docker-compose-base.yaml: services with 'depends_on' cannot be extended{code} How to reproduce: Run the e2e_cli example as directed, and by uncommenting the lines in /base/docker-compose-base.yaml as directed in the same file.  Note: After this error is taken care of, there are several other issues with the current environment that fails the e2e with couch.  This is due to the re-arranging of the docker-compose files.    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Dave asked us not to use the term SideDB in the docs, but rather use the term 'private data'.  We have 1 reference to sideDB in the private data key concept, so that if someone searches on the term sidedb, they will be taken to the appropriate content.     However, Barry noticed that the search also returned a hit in the Introduction and was confused because there is no doc topic called SideDB.     I'd like to remove the reference to sideDB in the Introduction. This sentence:     Fabric is also working on two sets of features that are intended to improve upon its privacy and confidentiality capabilities, specifically: private data – a feature we call SideDB, and zero knowledge proofs (ZKP).  to  To improve upon its privacy and confidentiality capabilities, Fabric has added support for <link: private data> and is working on zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) available in the future.        ></description> </Issue>

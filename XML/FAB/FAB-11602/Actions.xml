CDATA  ~mne   ~adc  Besides the child FAB-7506, what else is needed here?  In prior discussions I thought I heard that there was other work underway in this area.  Could you link those jiras or create child stories here?  Also, concerning "Currently the chaincode is unable to gain any insight into the creator beyond the basic identity bytes", it's not just the basic identity bytes that are available, there is the Client Identity package that can provide some other information: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/chaincode/lib/cid In the description could you be more specific about what is currently available why that it still lacking?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~denyeart , let me point to what  ~mne  wrote: " There’s no way to for instance check that they are an admin, or a client, or part of some OU etc. without doing custom parsing of the serialized identity". Indeed, this is what the *cid* package does. What this FAB is asking for, in connection with FAB-7506, there might be some overlapping actually, is to have a way for the chaincode to leverage the MSP infrastructure at the peer side to reason about the creator of a transaction.  ~mne , please, jump in if I'm missing or misinterpreted something.   Actually, FAB-7506 needs an update. It still refers to RSCC, for example.     ></body> </Action>
<Action id="49167" issue="32854" author="mne" type="comment" body="Hi  ~denyeart , indeed what  ~adc  writes captures it quite nicely: we need to make certain MSP functionality available to the chaincode beyond cid. I&apos;ll make this more clear. It&apos;s captured in large parts by FAB-7506, which is part of this epic and needs an overhaul as Angelo indicated. Also we need means to store this &quot;ownership&quot; information - corresponding Jira items will follow." created="2018-08-21 14:49:11.0" updateauthor="mne" updated="2018-08-21 14:49:11.0"/>

CDATA  ~angelo.decaro   ~mne   I've updated the epic name to be "Chaincode-level access control with MSP support" to indicate the MSP aspect.  The last sentence in the description gives a hint about this: "What is needed though still is the ability to reason about this identity through the MSP."  Could you expand on that sentence in the description, maybe provide an example.  And yes, it would be good to include a child Story for each distinct aspect.  ></body> </Action>

The `outputBlock` is only used for orderer bootstrap, and is not involved in channel creation.  The `peer channel create` command sends the configtx to the orderer, which creates the channel, and the genesis block for that channel.  The `peer channel create` command then retrieves the block from the orderer, and writes it to disk.  It is this output block which must be used as the parameter to the join channel.  ></body> </Action>

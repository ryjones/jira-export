CDATA We really need to have a simpler presentation and we could use a sample app.  I'd like to see the binaries installable via the likes of homebrew (OS X), NuGet (Windows) and apt (linux).  If we don't have that, then ideally we present a less complicated structure for the tarball.  The yamls and scripts should be at the top, and binaries should be under bin/ It might be worthwhile including a simple installer if we don't have native installer support.  It would also be good to simplify the prose in getting_started.rst - right now, it is overly complex in its presentation (IMO).        ></description> </Issue>

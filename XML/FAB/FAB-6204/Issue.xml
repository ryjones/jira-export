CDATA To identify Security Vulnerabilities in the node modules that Fabric Node SDK is dependent on , usage of nsp package (https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) is vogue in the industry. We should include this in our Node SDK CI job.     I did some experimentation using NSP on fabric-sdk-node and result come out clean. I am not sure whether it produces false positives. I would not like this to be a voting job for that reason.     In the event of existence of Security Vulnerability(ies) , email notification should be sent to Node SDK team.  ></description> </Issue>

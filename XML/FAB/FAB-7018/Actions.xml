CDATA  ~yacovm  digging into this a bit, this is due to a change in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4347. The idea was that if there's an error, users would have to check if the error is "chaincode error" (ie, treat it like a keyword) and then use status and message.  Example  bq. Error: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = *chaincode error* (status: 500, message: Error installing chaincode code mycc:0(chaincode /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/mycc.0 exists))  But as you point out, returning pResp is useless as gRPC will ignore it. On the + side, either pResp != nil and everything's good or err != nil and user has to look for "chaincode error" to determine if it was a fabric or chaincode error.  ></body> </Action>

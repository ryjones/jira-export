CDATA Create a marbles-private testcase, simple and providing good functional coverage; (refer FAB-10135); could use as interop test if desired with FAB-16719. Use as a basis for a test in the k8ssystest suite, using go test driver and operator functions and testInput file.   Provide a nice description of a min config required including number of peers/orgs that are in or out of the collection; endorsements required, dissemination policy parameter values, etc.   And with an eye on using with runPTE:  List any prerequisite steps (install, instantiate, etc) required to be done by the tester before test execution (or if they could/should be specified as optional in the testInput file) - to ensure for example that a retest with runPTE won't try to rerun steps such as instantiation and cause a test failure.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need an API cheat sheet in the main Fabric docs, which has pointers to the contract and ledger API reference doc and snippets for each of the three supported languages.  It is currently way too difficult to find the API reference docs, and once you get there, there are no snippets showing how the APIs work together, e.g. the sequence of APIs to call for the most trivial state-based endorsement scenario.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Since the {{ConsensusType}} value in the {{Orderer}} group contains both the {{type}} of the orderer and an opaque {{metadata}}, any updates to the metadata would lead to the configuration update being of Type B (NOTE: updating the {{type}} is never allowed). The {{metadata}} contains a list of {{Consenters}}. As part of this story, there will only be a single {{Consenter}}. Any updates to any of the fields of this single {{Consenter}} viz; {{Host}}, {{Port}}, {{ClientTlsCert}} and {{ServerTlsCert}} would lead to the configuration update being of Type B. For this story, we will be rejecting such configuration updates.  Eventually such Type B updates will also include the following updates to the {{Consenter}} list itself of which _we only allow one at a time_:  1. update of the fields of any single {{Consenter}}, 2. addition of a {{Consenter}}, 3. removal of a {{Consenter}}.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kchristidis   ~C0rWin  From the  Raft Jira breakdown|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R02-xjdl4hNw90kN4NZ1kX0f4QoIYn51_1UHlwy-GQs/edit#gid=1451154482 , what I am working on is the Week 3 task. Processing type B configurations is part of Weeks 5-7 and I think better fits as part of FAB-11161 based on the description of Weeks 5-7.  Also from the description of this JIRA: {quote}_For now, we allow only Type A configuration updates in. (And no channel creation requests yet - these are technically Type A as well.)_ {quote} Of course, we can also consider expanding the scope of this JIRA.  ></body> </Action>

Now that we can test Type B processing w/o the need for multiple nodes (because a Type B transaction can just modify, say, the {{MaxSizePerMsg}} that will be stored in your work in FAB-11861), I think it makes sense to put Type B work back in here.

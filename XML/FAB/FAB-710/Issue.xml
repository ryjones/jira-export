CDATA This message appears on the peer console whenever I run Ratnakar's sample application, whether the application fails or succeeds:  +15:10:05.134  eventhub_producer  Chat -> ERRO 017 Error during Chat, stopping handler: stream error: code = 1 desc = "context canceled" + I attached logs from yesterday's run.  Peer logging level = DEBUG is set. On the client side, I captured stdout and stderr.   If you will look in the tracing, you'll see some interesting error messages: *18:32:36.210  ledger  CommitTxBatch -> DEBU 37e There were some erroneous transactions. We need to send a 'TX rejected' message here. * Here is a link to Ratnakar's sample: https://github.com/ratnakar-asara/NodeSdkSample/tree/master/events  I am running on a vlaunch VM.  Ratnakar runs in vagrant on a laptop, but he reports seeing the message too.        ></description> </Issue>

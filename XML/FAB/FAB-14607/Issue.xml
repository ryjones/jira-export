CDATA h3. Expected:  The onboarded orderer should retrieve all blocks in the channel from other orderer and continue thereafter to participate in consensus in the channel. During this process, we expected to see no errors, as described in FAB-13702. h3. Observed:  We observed that the orderer4 go onboarded and started pulling the blocks from other orderers.  We found ERROR logs in the orderer4, when on-boarded to the application channel while traffic running.    {code:java} Mar 12 11:21:08 orderer4th-ordererorg2-c78cfb48b-nt8cp orderer4th-ordererorg2 2019-03-12 15:21:08.606 UTC  orderer.common.cluster  RetrieveVerifier -> ERRO 70418 No verifier for channel testorgschannel1 existsMar 12 11:21:08 orderer4th-ordererorg2-c78cfb48b-nt8cp orderer4th-ordererorg2 2019-03-12 15:21:08.606 UTC  orderer.common.cluster.replication  tryFetchBlock -> ERRO 70419 Failed verifying received blocks: couldn't acquire verifier for channel testorgschannel1{code}    Timestamp at which the error found: Mar 12 11:21:08   URL for orderer4 logs: Go to  https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/logging  and click on View LogDNA for LogDNA-community-svt-lab  Metrics URL:  https://prometheus.community-svt.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/graph?g0.range_input=12h&g0.expr=&g0.tab=0&g1.range_input=1h&g1.expr=&g1.tab=1      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I was trying to get the status of a transaction by using node.js SDK. I know about `queryTransaction` method which returns the transaction data, and in it, I can find transaction response. But its limitation is that it only returns response `200` if the transaction gets succeeded or _Failed to get transaction_ message if the transaction is invalid or hasn't mined yet.  `queryTransaction` method queries ledger data present on the peers and then gives a response. But what if I want to know if a transaction is in process or not? How can I get the response _pending_ if a transaction id is valid but hasn't mined yet?  ></description> </Issue>

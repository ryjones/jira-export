CDATA So this feels like a sample that replaces some of the old samples for people who aren't using the new programming model (yet) and/or are using previous versions of Fabric generally. Would it makes sense then to cherry pick this app back to previous releases?  I would likewise assume that building an app using the programming model will be the recommended application development path?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA v1.4 updated fabcar with both high level and low level programming model samples (beginner sample).  v1.4 also introduced commercial paper sample using high level programming model (intermediate sample).  v2.0 will continue the evolution on these samples, and will remove balance-transfer in sub-task FAB-14784.  ></body> </Action>

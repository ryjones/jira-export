CDATA A new sample should focus on good application practices, such that Fabric application developers can use it as an example and starting point for their own applications.  The new sample should: * utilize Service Discovery with preferred orgs/peers configured.  For example if endorsement requires two orgs, the application may want to utilize one random peer from it's own organization, and one random peer from any other org (see FABN-982 for related SDK service discovery improvements).  The 'randomness' ensures load balancing across peers. Additionally it should be possible to specify exact endorser organizations, for example state-based endorsement scenarios will require this. * Do proposal retries for certain proposal failures like gRPC errors. Chaincode errors may or may not benefit from a retry, depending on the problem. (see FABN-984 for SDK retry improvements). * Check that all proposal responses are consistent before submitting transaction to orderer (and if not consistent, request another proposal and throw out the 'bad' proposal response). * Use channel events to ensure submitted transactions are validated * Do transaction retries for invalidated transactions (such as upon MVCC_READ_CONFLICT invalidations) * Reuse channels, channel event hub registrations, etc instead of obtaining a new one for each transaction.  The new sample should not: * have extra layers on top which will only distract sample consumers (REST APIs, UI).  ></description> </Issue>

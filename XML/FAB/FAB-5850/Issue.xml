CDATA Operations personnel need to be able to see which peers are gossip org leaders, and which are not - and when the change occurs. This information will aid in debugging efforts, as well as network configuration/setup because they might wish to assign more powerful servers as their orgleaders. We noticed there is a gossip related log at debug level saying "Become a leader" when a peer wins election and becomes a leader. This should be printed at the default level (it seems the gossip default mode is WARNING level).  In addition,we noticed in code there is a log "Stop being a leader", but we never saw this log during our tests. This needs to be printed when an orgleader abdicates to another peer. And this log should be printed at the default (WARNING) level too.  _(8/28 edit: we did finally see this log, when using appropriate configuration settings. But it is still only a DEBUG log, and should be printed at WARNING level.)_   In summary: please print a gossip log at default (warning) level in peer whenever peer becomes a leader or whenever peer stops being a leader.The other similar logs may remain at debug level (such as whenever a peer merely checks to see if IsLeader").  Printing these logs as requested will also facilitate automation testing.  ></description> </Issue>

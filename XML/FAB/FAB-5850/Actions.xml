CDATA {quote}This should be printed at the default level (it seems the gossip default mode is WARNING level).{quote}  But this isn't a warning though. I don't agree with this statement that it should be printed in the default level.  Do you want me to make it INFO?  {quote}Printing these logs as requested will also facilitate automation testing.{quote} I don't see what's the issue with just grepping the lines from the log. If the log is in INFO then it shouldn't take more time   {quote}In addition,we noticed in code there is a log "Stop being a leader", but we never saw this log during our tests. This needs to be printed when an orgleader abdicates to another peer. And this log should be printed at the default (WARNING) level too.{quote} This isn't a warning though. I can make it info if you want.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We requested WARNING because I do not know if INFO will be sufficient in some environments where they run at the ERROR or WARNING level.  However, I agree it seems to fit better architecturally into INFO level, so I think we can be satisfied with INFO for occasional config and operational logs.  ></body> </Action>

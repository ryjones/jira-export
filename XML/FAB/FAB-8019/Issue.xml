CDATA The CouchDB retry currently assumes the first pass through is actually retry number 1.  It also does not currently allow a setting of zero retries. Â  This can be confusing to the end user and will prevent some potential use cases that may need to wrap the request handler with zero retry logic.  ></description> </Issue>

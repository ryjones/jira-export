CDATA We are testing a refurbished application of "test-network" in our company.  I have the following process within my chaincode. {code:java} Aval = Aval - amount; Bval = Bval + amount; await stub.putState(A, Buffer.from(Aval.toString())); await stub.putState(B, Buffer.from(Bval.toString()));{code} It worked fine for four months, but at some point we realized that the A data and B data were not consistent. The A data reflected correctly and the B data rolled back.  My chaincode didn't have any errors in it, but The peer logs show that the warning is occurring. {code:java}  33m2020-11-11 00:26:02.026 UTC  statecouchdb  commitUpdates -> WARN 10719 0m CouchDB batch document update encountered an problem.

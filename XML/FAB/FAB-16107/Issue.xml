CDATA The assorted external builder components (detect, build, and launch), all currently lose the output of the commands.  For debugging build failures, or failures to detect etc., we should stream the standard error output of these invocations back to the peer logs.  Note: standard out will be reserved for communication with the process.  Acceptance: the output of 'detect', 'build', and 'launch', can be seen at debug level.  The output of 'build' and 'launch' can be seen at warning level when there is a failure. The log records should include some information about which process is generating the output.  ></description> </Issue>

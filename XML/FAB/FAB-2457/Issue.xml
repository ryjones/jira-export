CDATA Currently there is no means to specify the policy to use for checking ACL for proposals. The default policy of > 50% admins would not work for most situations (unlike the committer side VSCC validations). Its more reasonable to say "is this creator issuing proposal an admin" as opposed to "are there >50% admins signing off on this proposal".  In any case this needs to be revisited. Till then propose we revert checkACL to allow proposals through.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~sykesm  - Happy to change / fix this ..... I added comments on the original CR as well, but let me add them here for easier discussion.  Here's the dilemma .... *idemixgen signerconfig* depends on the artifacts generated by *idemixgen ca-genkey*   So should I have one IT is a context where I call *ca-genkey* by itself and then another context where both are called in the same IT? Or just go with a single context and IT where both are called and checked serially?    I cannot create/delete the directory after running *ca-genkey* and then call *signerconfig*  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As an org with channel Reader permission, I should be able to invoke chaincode that queries channel ledger data.  Currently you must have channel Writer permission to invoke a chaincode that only queries (reads) channel ledger data.  This does not make sense and has caused problems for many users.  We should either check access control based on the actual chaincode operations performed (e.g. Puts vs Gets), or we should make this explicit and introduce a read-only Invoke that can only do Gets (no Puts) that channel Readers can call.   ></description> </Issue>

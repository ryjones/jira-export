What experience does it improve? Are there alternatives that we should pursue instead?  I certainly should have taken a little more care in documenting this, the rationale is ultimately a little hidden in the message.  > especially for manipulating channel config  Our samples, in particular the "Extend your first network", and "Upgrade your first network" have a dependency on jq, so they install it as a matter of course in the scripts.  Since the channel config when in human readable form, is a large JSON document, jq is a nice way to manipulate it, either to view small sections of it, or to programatically modify it.  So, in our documentation, we reference 'jq', but must preface it with "make sure it's installed", it would be nice if we could assume jq is present in our images to reduce one step in our docs.  ></body> </Action>

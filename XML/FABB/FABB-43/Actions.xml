CDATA There are probably 2 issues here:  1) We should not be shipping the end-to-end.rst with the getting started (guess we forgot to remove it *again*) Â (but I think we are going to have a new getting started anyway)    2) We don't claim support for developing on Windows at this point - so perhaps by doing 1) above we'll nip this in the bug  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As of 1.11, the go cache feature is required to use golang.org/x/tools/go/packages. The {{packages}} package is pretty much required by any tools that wish to do AST processing in the world of go modules.  Additionally, as of go 1.12, the GOCACHE=off directive will no longer be honored.  Also, it's unclear why the cache was ever disabled at all instead of pointing to a proper location.  This was discovered while trying to run tools in the buildenv container that rely on the new {{packages}} package.  ></description> </Issue>

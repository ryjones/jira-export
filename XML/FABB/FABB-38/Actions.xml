CDATA It appears that the maximum size for HTTP requests to CoucbDB 2.1.x is 64MB.  You can override this by setting `httpd.max_http_request_size` in the local.ini file but not sure there is anyway to change the system once it is up and running.  Looks like the max value can be up to 4GB so will go with that.   ~denyeart   ></body> </Action>

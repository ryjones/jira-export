CDATA Just to add a few more details to this.  I've tried `make clean && make dist-clean && make protos` but I get the same error.  Colleagues have been unable to reproduce this on their machines, so my theory is:  An unsuccessful run on my machine has created artifacts that (1) prevent `make protos` from completing successfully, and that (2) `make clean` and/or `make dist-clean` fail to remove.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I am running into this issue also when running make protos in the vagrant dev env. If I run {{./scripts/compile_protos.sh}} script directly, it works, otherwise when running the script in docker (via `make protos`) It fails on when processing `fabric/core/comm/testdata/grpc/test.proto`.   The problem is that there is no {{option go_package}} statement, so it's trying to generate the go files into the output directory root, {{/opt/gopath/src}}, a directory that in the docker container is only writeable by root, but the command is run under a non-root user (user with id=1000).   ~mastersingh24  should provide some guidance on what the appropriate action should be. We can either make {{make protos}} ignore the problem proto, or maybe the proto can use a {{go_package}} statement.  ></body> </Action>

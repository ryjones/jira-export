CDATA Currently, the admin username and password are appended to the docker.ini file in etc/local.d on container start/restart.  This can cause extra  admins  stanzas to appear in the docker.ini.  Also, a default local.ini file is created by CouchDB on initial startup in the /etc directory.   Storing the user name and password in the docker.ini is confusing since there is an  admins  stanza in the local.ini.  It would be better to manage the username and password in the local.ini.  Adding a volume for the /etc would also allow easier backup and maintenance of configuration files across server upgrades.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA What is the specific need for this change? Or is it just to stay current with the latest fixes?  https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html     I agree this probably does not carry a high risk this time, being minor releases. Nevertheless, it seems we should restrict ourselves adding new versions by the design cutoff (weeks ago), rather than introducing instability this late in the release cycle as we are trying to get to RC1 - which is even more of a concern if we want to do major upgrade to GO 11.  Is there a list of tools versions like this that should be reviewed for possible upversioning by design team each release by design cutoff date? A Jira task?  ~sykesm   ~denyeart   ~bmos299      ></body> </Action>

CDATA > Nevertheless, it seems we should restrict ourselves adding new versions by the design cutoff (weeks ago)  Prereq currency has absolutely nothing to do with design. We have a terrible track record of maintaining currency on our prereqs and we need to move from a posture of FUD to one where we have faith in our pipelines and processes to catch regressions.  In this case, go 1.10 is several months old. We want to move to newer versions to pick up migration support for vgo and fixes to byte slice comparisons on s390x.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA BTW I've added uplift of go, java, and node.js versions to the release checklist at  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12IpQnREUoJEUj2pF2z-0Up55geItFd94fcsbAkPacTg/edit#  .   ~sykesm  I agree we need to improve on staying current on prereqs, including the many vendored packages. Do you have any specific recommendations that have worked well on other projects?  Shall we divide and conquer the list and re-visit every 3 months or so, perhaps at the beginning of the last month of the release?  ></body> </Action>

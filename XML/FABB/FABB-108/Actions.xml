CDATA  ~mastersingh24  master is already on more recent version of CouchDB v2.2.  Do we need to backport prior Fabric releases to use v2.1.2 or v2.2? How far back?  Note that fabric-baseimage does not yet have release branches, so I believe we'll need to invest in that (potential CI updates) before being able to do maintenance in prior release baseimages (as we can't simply move old releases up to latest master baseimage).  We'll also likely need to revisit our baseimage version numbering approach, since we already use third digit releases.   Actually probably need to decouple the third party images from the baseimage.  Maybe this is the force function to make that happen.  ></body> </Action>

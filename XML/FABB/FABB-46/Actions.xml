<Action id="19759" issue="13461" author="ales" type="comment" body="Thanks, I&apos;ll fix it asap. But: Response2.Payload was largely ignored in the design/security discussion. It does not seem to be signed in the current infrastructure, and this aspect should be discussed. Also, the client will receive n Response2.Payload messages, one from each of its endorsers. Might they not differ in content? This seems to be possible given that no ordering has taken place yet. What does it mean if they differ? How should the field be used by the SDK given these observations?" created="2016-11-15 09:45:50.0" updateauthor="ales" updated="2016-11-15 09:45:50.0"/>

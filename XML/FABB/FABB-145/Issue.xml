CDATA Due to the old NPM version, the `prepare` bug described in this stackoverflow  post|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52766731/npm-v6-4-1-not-running-prepare-inside-docker  and in this Github  issue|https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17346  exists within the chaincode container. As a result, `prepare` doesn't run as root and any compile procedures may not work correctly. This is especially problematic when trying to compile/deploy chaincode that depends on a module in another git repo (that needs to be compiled). This bug has been fixed in newer versions of NPM.  Current workaround is to include a prestart script in the `package.json` like so:     "prestart": "npm config set unsafe-perm true"     But this brings about security risks and should be avoided.  ></description> </Issue>

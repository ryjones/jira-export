Fabric currently uses an outdated version of viper which preserves the case of nested keys when parsing.  Newer versions of viper change this behavior and lower case all keys.  Is it possible that you are somehow picking up a newer version of dependencies depending on the build or platform?" created="2019-06-05 20:18:58.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2019-06-05 20:18:58.0"/>

CDATA OS - Ubuntu 16.04. Using docker image of hyperledger/fabric-baseimage  version 0.2.1  ></environment> <description><! CDATA For ppc64le architecture, the GOROOT is actually set to '/usr/local/go' in the scripts/common/setup.sh. However while creating the docker image, in the Dockerfile, we are over-riding the GOROOT using ENV variable and setting it to /opt/go (as done for x86_64 and s390x).  Due to this, the docker instance of fabric-baseimage fails to run anything specific to go. This also fails the build of fabric.  ></description> </Issue>

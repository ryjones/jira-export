CDATA So I figured this out.   In the short term, you may need to use fabric-baseimage rather than fabric-baseos here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L333   (or set {noformat} CORE_CHAINCODE_GOLANG_RUNTIME{noformat} ).  To fix this issues, we'll need to install the tzdata package in fabric-baseos (we should probably do it for fabric-baseimage as well).  fabric-baseimage does not have the issue per se as it actually included the GO compiler              ></body> </Action>

CDATA Why we include GO-Compiler package as part of fabric-base-os in case of IBM release?  Why don't we follow a similar approach for both?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Let me clarify:  *hyperledger/fabric-baseos* is very minimal and does not include the Go compiler nor did it include the tzdata package  *hyperledger/fabric-baseimage* does include the Go compiler  The suggestion you use *hyperledger/fabric-baseimage* in the near term was based on the fact this is does have the Go compiler (and the *LoadLocation* function will search the system paths and finally will look for *$GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip* which is provided with the Go compiler).  I submitted a patch for *hyperledger/fabric-baseos* to add the tzdata package.     *ibm-blockchain/fabric-baseos* is derived from *hyperledger/fabric-baseos* but also includes a few extra packages (network utils mainly) which also happen to install the tzdata package  ></body> </Action>

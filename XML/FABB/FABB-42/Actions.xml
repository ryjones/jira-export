CDATA Can you see what DNS servers your NetworkManager is using?  #nmcli dev show | grep DNS     Simply comment out the line dns=dnsmasq in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf,  restart your nwmger:  sudo service network-manager restart     and try again?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~capamaster  - Are you actually trying to use an HTTP proxy?  Looks like your proxy is running on your Ubuntu host on 127.0.0.1:3128.  When 127.0.0.1 is passed to the Docker RUN commands in the container, 127.0.0.1 refers to the container and not to the host (therefore is cannot connect your your proxy).   (curl uses the http_proxy / https_proxy env variables as do many Linux tools).  So if you really need to use a proxy, you need to make sure it is available at an address which the container can actually reach - for example you might want to bind your proxy to the Docker bridge network on your Ubuntu host.  ></body> </Action>

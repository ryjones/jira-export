CDATA I intended to use the official images, now that docker hub officially supports multi arch for its official images, but couchdb is still in the process of enabling multiarch support ( https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1121) .   Also, there are some outstanding issues running on s390x ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3261 ).   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sanchezl  I've changed from Bug to Improvement.  I don't think there is any problem per se with the current scripts, but I agree it would make sense to get in sync with the official images.  Let us know if you think there is a real Bug with the current scripts.  Since we are already post-alpha and may not do a beta, I'm thinking it would make more sense to make these updates at the beginning of 1.2 rather than at the end of 1.1.  If you think otherwise please explain the rationale.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA baseimage is used across releases.  I'm not sure if v1.1.1 will move up to the latest baseimage yet.  I've removed FixVersion v1.0.7, as we don't want to make such large changes to v1.0.x release.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This was done in v1.2.0 timeframe, but unfortunately had to be backed out in baseimage 0.4.10 (FAB-10927) due to lack of sufficient testing before the v1.2.0 release date.  The changes will be re-applied using FAB-11132 in v1.3.0 timeframe.  ></body> </Action>

The Couchdb improvements and node.js version updates need to be re-applied to baseimage now that v1.2.0 is behind us. And then Fabric and Fabric-CA master will need to switch over to the new baseimage so that we can get some testing on the updates prior to v1.3.0." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-07-12 14:25:22.0" updated="2019-03-27 15:03:21.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-26 10:33:36.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="32069"/>

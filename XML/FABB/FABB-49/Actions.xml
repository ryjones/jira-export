CDATA A workaround for this is to change the Kafka version specified by {{orderer.yaml}} to match that found in baseimage.  Personally, I would lean towards updating the baseimage of Kafka though, as Kafka has had bug fixes and improvements.  ></body> </Action>

If you are using a version of Kafka *older* than {{0.10.2.1}}, set the  {{ORDERER_KAFKA_VERSION}} environment variable on your containers to the appropriate value.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="39062" issue="26964" author="scottz" type="comment" body="Please review my suggestion in that doc,  ~sanchezl , to reword &quot;appropriate value&quot;. Also, if we use kafka version 1.0 in fabric v1.1, and then what are the instructions for upgrades? For those existing networks using 0.9.0,1 already, they should set the value to 0.9.0.1 for the upgrading of fabric orderers to v1.1. But then we need to finish our instructions for upgrade. They will need to upgrade their kafkas eventually (probably sooner than later), AND will need to change this kafka version to v1.0 from 0.9.0.1. I think we have been saying that they could upgrade their kafkas independently, without doing change the kafka version in the orderers and without restarting the orderers, and then later whenever they upgrade fabric again then they should change kafka version? But wouldn&apos;t they hit this problem again?" created="2018-01-24 14:37:34.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-01-24 14:37:34.0"/>

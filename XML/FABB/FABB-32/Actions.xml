<Action id="19026" issue="12713" author="mastersingh24" type="comment" body="You need to make sure that you have the right setting for `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT`.  Typically this ends up being the remote port for the Docker daemon which is not running by default.  You&apos;ll need to start the Docker daemon with the `-H` option to and specify the remote IP:Port you want it to listen on (e.g. `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375` ) and then specify that as the value for `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT` .  If you use `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375` , then the default value in the docs should work" created="2016-09-28 11:10:06.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2016-09-28 11:10:06.0"/>

CDATA Thanks a lot for the solution. I just tried the same as someone on stackoverflow provided the same.  Additionally I had to do the following to make it work  docker pull hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:x86_64-0.1.0 docker tag hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:x86_64-0.1.0 hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:latest  I think it is high time someone updated the official documentation @ http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup/Network-setup/#leveraging-published-docker-images  ></body> </Action>

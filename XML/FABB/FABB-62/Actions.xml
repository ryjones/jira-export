CDATA I have created a patch for it:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/23781/ Â which seems to fail on s390x due to failure to download some packages (reasons unrelated to my change) {code:java} E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead. The command '/bin/sh -c cd /tmp/scripts && common/packages.sh && common/setup.sh && docker/fixup.sh && common/cleanup.sh && rm -rf /tmp/scripts' returned a non-zero code: 100 Makefile:68: recipe for target 'build/docker/baseimage/.s390x-0.4.9' failed make: ***  build/docker/baseimage/.s390x-0.4.9  Error 100 Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure{code}  ></body> </Action>

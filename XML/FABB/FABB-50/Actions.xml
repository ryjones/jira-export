CDATA I am going to close this as I just went through and everything works.  The only thing missing is that we don't list the "couchdb" target in the list in the Makefile.  But {{make docker}} actually does build fabric-couchdb  If you run {{make docker}} first, then fabric-couchdb already exists and {{make couchdb}} correctly returns with {{make: Nothing to be done for `couchdb'.}}  ></body> </Action>

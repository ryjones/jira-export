CDATA  ~denyeart , I am not sure if I am full understand your point. 1. fabric-chaincode-go will replace ... so developer will use cid in chaincode-go instead of ext/cid in fabric 1.4 branch. 2. fabric-chaincode-go is moved to git hub, so I am able to fork and create PR.  I am doing the PR now, will keep you update in comments.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~SamYuan1990   PR merged in fabric-chaincode-go using the new approach.  Since the release-1.4 commit had already been merged in fabric using your original approach (via your gerrit CR contribution), please do a second gerrit CR in fabric release-1.4 to match the new approach. Sorry you have to do both a PR and a Gerrit CR to different repos/branch in this case... you got caught in the middle of our transition from Gerrit to Github.  ></body> </Action>

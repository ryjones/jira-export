CDATA Pre discussed in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/pull/9  Currently the GetID() interface just handle x509 type MSP. Making a one one mapping for identity and ID string.  We need it become this: func (c *clientIdentityImpl) GetID() (string, error) should return ClientIDUnresolvableError as a general fail case, and handle msp type for both x509 and idemix, making a one one mapping for identity and ID string.  // ClientIDUnresolvableError indicates that the identity provider cannot map the // client's identity to a stable ID.  This error is returned by membership service providers // such as IdentityMixer which provide unlinkability across invocations. var ClientIDUnresolvableError = errors.New("generating a ClientID is not supported by this identity's membership service provider")  ></description> </Issue>

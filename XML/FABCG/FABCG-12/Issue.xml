CDATA Public CAs do not support the inclusion of extra extension attributes like the one used for chaincode access control in Fabric that had OID "1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.1".  This obliges the use of Fabric-CA to be able to use certificate attributes with the cid library. For some organizations it is not allowed by the security department to use Fabric-CA and they prefer to use other CA services.  Access control in the chaincode could also be done by using other fields in the certificates, like for example the OU field of the subject. The advantage of using the OU field is that it is a standard x509 field and that the distinguished name of a x509 certificate subject can have multiple OU values.  The objective of this Jira story is to add a method in the cid library that looks for a specified OU value in the certificate of the transaction sender so the cid library can also be used for access control based on OU values and people do not have to write their custom function for it.

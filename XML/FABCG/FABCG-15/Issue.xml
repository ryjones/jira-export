CDATA Hi Team,  I have a kubernetes setup of HLF2.2 with Golang Chaincode and Nodejs SDK. I am performing load test on the network, when i try with 250 Concurrent thread, it shows unexpectedly chaincode installation Error. (*Error: Chaincode definiation exist but not found, make sure it's Installed properly*)  Node SDK not able to find any endorsement peer for provided chaincode and throw Exception.  After inspecting I found that * 3 out 4 Peer's ledger were crashed. * Peer disconnects from channel. * It was not showing installed Chain-code.  * unable to Query or Invoke from Cli.  I tried restarting the cluster but no luck.  Then I had to re-Install new version of chaincode on Peer's, and it's working fine now.  I am bit worried about the robustness of HLF network and which is not giving me enough confidence to use it in production.  And *also there is no mechanism to monitor container of Chaincode in kubernetes, as it does not show-up in the pods list.* And even i am not sure how much of load is on Chain-code when performing load test.  I have allocated 4GB RAM and 2-Core CPU to each Peer. is that enough for production level setup. How can we ensure that Chain-code's container gets enough resource allocation. Should I increase my peers RAM further.  ></description> </Issue>

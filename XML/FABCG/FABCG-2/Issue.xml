CDATA The CI for fabric-chaincode-go currently only does vet and test, no gofmt.  Rather than requiring reviewers to catch deviations from the gofmt manually, having CI do it would be a better option.  {{gofmt}}  and {{goimports}}; If either would result in a change, the build should fail.  Installing {{goimports}} should make use of the {{tools.go}} pattern to ensure we're installing a known version; Alternatively, use a docker image that has the correct versions of the tools pre-populated. In this case, the Dockerfile required to build the container should be placed in the {{ci}} folder, the image pushed with an appropriately versioned tag, and the pipeline definition updated to point to the build container.  (This is a lot like what's done in fabric-protos for build.)  ></description> </Issue>

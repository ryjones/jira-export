CDATA When using Fabric Discovery, additional information is included for the discovered peer, such as ledger height and deployed chaincodes. This information should be exposed in the SDK interface.  In order to support properties added by the peer in the future, theÂ properties should be exposed in a generic way, i.e. key-value map, so that the SDK doesn't require code changes in order to access these properties.  ></description> </Issue>

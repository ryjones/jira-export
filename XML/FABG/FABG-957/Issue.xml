CDATA The name of private key file generated by cryptogen in fabric 2.0 is always `priv_sk`. This will cause a `not found` error when initilize a user in sdk.   After dig into sdk code , I found  sdk initialize key store with specific `SKI_sk`   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/msp/filekeystore.go#L37   which I think is not appropriate. Auto detect key file with suffic `_sk` or just use the file under dir `keystore` is more comprehensive or we can use file with name `SKI_sk` or `priv_sk` to support fabric1.x and fabric2.0  ></description> </Issue>

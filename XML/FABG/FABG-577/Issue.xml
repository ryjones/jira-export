CDATA The InvokeChaincode helper function currently only returns a txID and an error. The proposal response is dropped.   This means that, to inspect the output of an invocation a subsequentÂ query needs to be made to the chain to determine the new asset value.  This is inefficient and not reliable since the block may not have yet propagated to the peer.  ></description> </Issue>

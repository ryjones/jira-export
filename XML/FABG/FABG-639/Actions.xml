CDATA  ~troyronda  From what I'm able to understand, the cryptopath for an organization can contain \{userName}, which is later replaced with the actual username in the   GetSigningIdentity() method of the CredentialManager. If the cryptoconfig and paths would be embedded into the config, then the usernames would also have to be embedded there. Would that be a problem? How are new users added at the moment and would that have to change if the users are embedded now?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~troyronda   ~Baha-sk  I have some questions about the desired behaviour of the paths config for loading user private keys and certificates.  Since we will have 3 ways of loading the certificates, what should the priorities be if all 3 are specified?  Additionally, if the preferred method is specified, but contains an invalid PEM, do we fall back to the next option if such is specified, or do we return an error directly?  Thirdly, if all methods fail, should the error contain the underlying reasons why each method failed with some kind of a multi-error or just say that something went wrong without specifying the errors that cause each failure?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~e-nikolov   Hope you go the answer for your queries.  Let me know if you need any more information. Also let me know if you already started working on it, otherwise I can do this change since some of my tasks are depending on this.  ></body> </Action>

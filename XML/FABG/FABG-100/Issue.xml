CDATA Objective: * Create higher-level SDK surface (easier, less implementation paths, more immutable) * Allows the app developer to think in terms of their consortium setup rather than about appropriate clients. * Allow plugability of providers and clients with defaults used if not specified.  This item is about adding org context and session abstractions on top of the providers and clients.    After this ticket, the structure will look similar to: * NewSDK -> NewOrgContext -> NewSession * NewSession -> NewSystemClient or NewChannelClient * NewSDK will allow optional factories for creation of providers and clients  Follow-on activities: * With the above structure, a credential manager and cacheing of peer discovery can later be added to the org context.  * Higher level interfaces should be exposed in the SDK package (fabapi) that encourage creation of new instances when parameters are changed (such as the peer list), rather than getters/setters.  ></description> </Issue>

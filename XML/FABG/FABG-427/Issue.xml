CDATA As a BCCSP user, I want to be able to manage SW keys in my custom key store.  KeyStore interface in SW BCCSP implementationÂ accepts the Key interface, which is opaque. BCCSP's SW file key store implementation serializes private keys (before persisting them) using functions that are not exported, so it's currently impossible to implement a custom KeyStore unless you want to keep the keys only in memory.  ></description> </Issue>

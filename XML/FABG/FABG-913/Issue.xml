CDATA When a request is sent to the Discovery Service and MaxTargets is set to > 1 then, even though a response is received from one peer, we wait for ALL other requests to complete. When a peer is down then (depending on the connection settings) this may take a long time given GRPC's retry logic.  A modification should be made so that the requests to other peers are canceled as soon as a successful response is received.   ></description> </Issue>

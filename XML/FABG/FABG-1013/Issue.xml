CDATA Following enhancement for #FABN-1632 to try for consistency across all SDKs.  Currently, at least for the Node SDK, when using service discovery and selecting which orderer to use when submitting a transaction, the SDK will iterate through the list of available orderers in the same sequence on each transaction.  This is far from ideal since if the orderer(s) at the front of the list are offline, the application will need to wait for those to time out and for the SDK to find a good orderer on each and every transaction. Users are reporting that this causes delays in their application.   ></description> </Issue>

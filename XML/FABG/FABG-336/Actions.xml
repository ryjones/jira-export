But we can&apos;t provide the absolute path because each machine has different GOPATH so when go-client read the certificate location through VIPER it check if variable $GOPATH exist and replace with value from os.Getenv(&quot;GOPATH&quot;) in this way we provide dynamic absolute path to run the integration test in different machine." created="2017-04-03 13:32:48.0" updateauthor="firas.qutishat" updated="2017-04-03 13:32:48.0"/>

CDATA Currently, PKCS11 resilience logic validates only sessions from pool or the one created by by OpenSession().  Recovery should also kick in if OpenSession() fails to return session and throws error due to any technical issues.  Context Handle also shouldn't panic once it exhausts all the attempts to recover session, it should return error so that any process trying to open session can retry after some time. (Helps when there is a network downtime)  ></description> </Issue>

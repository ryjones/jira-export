CDATA As stated by David Enyeart, a packaged chaincode archive must contain the META-INF directory (e.g. used for the definition of CouchDB indexes) at its root.  Currently, the packager in > ./pkg/fab/ccpackager/gopackager/packager.go with its findSource routine places the META-INF directory below the chaincode's source directory structure, e.g. > src/github.com/example_cc/META-INF  Due to this, the automatic creation of CouchDB indexes introduced in Fabric 1.1 does not work.  ></description> </Issue>

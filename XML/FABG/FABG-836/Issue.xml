CDATA As a first step in supporting Go modules, add a go.mod file to the root of the SDK and also make the third_party 'proto' directory a module. (The 'proto' directory should really be exposed as a module directly in Fabric, in which case the SDK wouldn't need to keep a copy.)  As a future task, we should expose more directories as modules (where it makes sense).     ></description> </Issue>

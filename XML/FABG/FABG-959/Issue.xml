CDATA Seems like a non-empty value for affiliation is being enforced by the sdk:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/bf5e77cb15bf123d8994d342f7d876f87bf6a9b3/pkg/msp/caclient.go#L172   However, this does not seem to match the fabric-ca server, which allows affiliation to be empty. Can we lift this restriction?  ></description> </Issue>

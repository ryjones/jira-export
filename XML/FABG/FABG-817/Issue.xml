CDATA Currently, there are a lot of items marked {{ Optional }} in the various {{config.yaml}} files. However, there are no test cases that test whether they are truly optional or not.  Confusing things further is that since there is no {{config.yaml}} documentation, the only guide users have is the test case configs. In every one of those files, almost all optional configuration items are exhaustively included; there is no way to document an optional item unless it is actually specified.  One possibility is to comment out optional items to both document them and to provide test case coverage, as is done in the proposed fix for FABG-814     ></description> </Issue>

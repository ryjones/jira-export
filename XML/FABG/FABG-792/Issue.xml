CDATA I am trying to make a client via the go sdk to connect the byfn fabric network.  I am blocked by the error:  Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out  peer0.org1.example.com:7051   There is no log in docker logs -f peer0.org1.example.com at all.  However, I am able to ping peer0.org1.example.com:  !image-2018-11-16-01-14-33-302.png!  The codes have been attached. The compose file (/first-network/docker-compose-cli.yaml) is from the byfn, with some small changes.  The client is in the same localhost. And I also tried to docker exec the cli container and run the client there, still face the same error...  I also tried to use the nodejs sample code, and  docker logs -f peer0.org1.example.com   displays the handshake error (which is expected, since the nodejs code is using wrong cert):  2018-11-16 01:57:05.715 UTC  core/comm  ServerHandshake -> ERRO 069 TLS handshake failed with error tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake \{"server": "PeerServer", "remote address": "172.27.0.1:47046"})     ></description> </Issue>

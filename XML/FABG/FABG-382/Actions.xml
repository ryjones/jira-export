Elsewhere, this is bumped up to 100ms (timeouts of less than 100ms are set to 100ms). This will work fine if you are running fabric locally, but fails 100% of the time when running over a network. Before deploying the SDK, I always need to manually change the timeout to 5 seconds." created="2017-07-14 04:41:22.0" updateauthor="passkit" updated="2017-07-14 04:41:22.0"/>

CDATA Could someone give an update about this task. Fabric 2.0 is released, Java and Node already support this feature, but go sdk. I would like to help implementing this functionality if someone could tell me where to start and what's the plan for this feature.   I researched Java/Node sdks + original peer cli in fabric, seems not a big deal to implement a few transactions since we already have all infrastructure to handle/process proposals.    ></body> </Action>

I know how to do this, just need your input which service/client to use and small guide, so later during PR I won't need to rework solution  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="68200" issue="41721" author="bstasyszyn" type="comment" body=" ~kopaygorodsky  By all means you are welcome to implement this feature. This should (most likely) be implemented in the resmgmt client. I&apos;m not very familiar with the new Lifecycle API so I&apos;m not sure whether you can hide it under the existing Install/Instantiate functions (by doing a switch on channel capabilities) or whether you need a new set of functions. Please submit a PR and we&apos;ll provide feedback. Thx!" created="2020-03-03 13:35:45.0" updateauthor="bstasyszyn" updated="2020-03-03 13:35:45.0"/>

CDATA  ~bstasyszyn  yes, that's what I wanted to hear. I'll add lifecycle functions into resmgmt. Install could be interchangeable, but instantiate. There is no instantiate in lifecycle. Thanks, I'll start working on it.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The keys of the 'organizations' collection in the SDK config are converted to lower case, while the name of the client organization is not, as it is a value (and not a key).  This leads to some problems, e.g. if one wants to retrieve the 'OrganizationConfig' of the client's organization from the 'NetworkConfig', which is returned as a map with the lower-cased organization names as keys. Example: the client's organization 'Org1' cannot be found in the map, which only provides a value for the key 'org1'. A manual conversion to lower case is necessary then.  Possible solutions: - convert all organization names to lower case when initializing the config - officially recommend to define all organization names in lower case (and adapt the exemplary SDK configurations in ./test)  ></description> </Issue>

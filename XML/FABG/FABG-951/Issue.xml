CDATA FABG-950 stabilized the integration tests with the caveat of disabling java and node chaincode integration tests.  These tests should be fixed and re-enabled.  Note these changes were due to disabling the tests: - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/50/files#diff-c90a8176d354fbe2d2c4d1e7e52bd565R1 - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/50/files#diff-a6989c407de1ec6aedde1d59d2fd40abR1 - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/50/files#diff-5c7c7e456a8c9d363c577213edd097b1R44 - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/50/files#diff-5c7c7e456a8c9d363c577213edd097b1L15   To fix, the chaincoded fixture needs to be updated. See scripts/chaincoded.sh.   Log message during integration tests: chaincoded_1         | 2020/02/13 19:48:28 Fatal: Chaincode had a non-exit error  example_node_cc_00, exec: "example_node_cc": executable file not found in $PATH    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA * All configuration and policies should be able to be passed as normal interfaces into the SDK as options (or structs where an interface doesnâ€™t make sense). * Config should be part of the package that has responsibility for it. Not just a giant config package. * There should be implementations for serialized config formats. The implementation has the responsibility of creating options (and making it easy for the user as an SDK option). Similar to now, a config format impl would expose its own With options. * Utilities should not be part of these interfaces - rather they should move to the appropriate package of responsibility (often as a static method).  ></description> </Issue>

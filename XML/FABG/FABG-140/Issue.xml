CDATA FAB-6189 added the ability to load BCCSP as a Go plugin.  Due to an issue in the Go standard library(  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22175  ), a Go plugin that imports bccsp/factory will not compile. This is because this package includes a method that calls plugin.Open() and due to the issue mentioned above, a plugin cannot call plugin.Open().  A fix for this issue has been merged into the tip of the Go project and is currently scheduled to be included in Go 1.10.  Until this fix is available, we propose to add a build flag to Fabric to disable BCCSP plugins to enable the use of BCCSP in other plugins (for example, auth and decoration handlers in FAB-6159 )  ></description> </Issue>

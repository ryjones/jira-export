CDATA We end up running into this issue where multiple peers are targeted for queryChannelConfig call and one of them lags behind by 100s of blocks (has old channel config). In this case Currently SDK considers all response valid, tries to match those responses and throws the following error: {code:java} QueryBlockConfig failed: Endorser Client Status Code: (3) ENDORSEMENT_MISMATCH. Description: payloads for config block do not match{code} queryChannelConfig response from the lagging peer shouldn't be considered valid.  fabric-sdk-go has blockHeightLagThreshold option for eventService.  Need similar functionality in queryChannelConfig.     ></description> </Issue>

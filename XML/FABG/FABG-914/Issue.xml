Although, if the outstanding request is in the process of dialling a server that&apos;s down, it will wait for the connection timeout, since the provided context is not used in the GRPC Dial. The provided context should be used as the parent context to the dial so that the dial is immediately cancelled." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2019-10-21 17:35:13.0" updated="2019-10-21 18:10:27.0" resolutiondate="2019-10-21 18:10:27.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="56024"/>

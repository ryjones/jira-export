CDATA I suggest not to return an error if the length of the target peers slice is zero in ./pkg/fabric-txn/resmgmtclient/resmgmt.go:115, but just return to the caller without an error.  If a TargetFilter is applied, it may be the case that no peer satisfies the Accept method. Due to the design of the JoinChannelWithOpts method and the TargetFilter interface, the caller cannot control that the target peers slice never becomes empty.  Alternatively: Provide an exported method for the caller to check the target peers slice after she has set a TargetFilter and before she calls JoinChannelWithOpts.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA TargetFilter logic for execute transaction has been updated by this change:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/17153/    ~sudeshrshetty  - could you please take a look at this ticket. This is JoinChannel so not the same flow, but similar.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/17153/  didn't update any logic in TargetFilter.  This change just applies a filter on proposal responses, which is technically a validator, so we renamed it to _EndorsementValidationHandler_. It fails endorsement if any of the proposal responses has _status=FAILED_ or if payload doesn't match between proposal responses     ></body> </Action>

But users cannot know beforehand if a target filter leads to an empty slice of targets. To find out which type of error occurred, they have to check the error string. That's in turn error-prone and ugly.  In my case, I want to abort my bootstrapper only in case of severe errors. If my target filter leads to an empty slice of targets, I do not want to abort, but just produce some warning instead.  Can you return the instance of a custom error type that can be checked easily or, alternatively, provide means to calculate and inspect the slice of targets based on a target filter before the actual join channel operation?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Both Block and Filtered block events already include the block number. The block number should also be included in the Tx Status and CC event.  The URL of the peer that produced the event should also be included in the event so that a client receiving the event can go back to that peer to query for state associated with the event (knowing that the peer is guaranteed to be at (or greater than) the block height in which the transaction was committed).   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The CS that includes support for dep addresses the sirupsen issue (at least when you use dep to populate vendor):   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/12725/   (not yet merged, but please provide feedback).  Note: sirupsen/logrus is a dependency of docker/moby which is a dependency of fabric (so becomes a transitive dependency of the SDK). docker/moby fixes the import case sensitivity in their latest code...  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~muralisr  The GoPkg.toml in the Go SDK is currently overriding fabric dependencies to achieve a build that only has the lowercase sirupsen vendoring.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/Gopkg.toml   Go dep tool:  https://github.com/golang/dep   We are also hoping to remove the vendor folder from the SDK's version control soon. The make populate target can recreate it using dep (and that generated vendor folder has the lowercase sirupsen).  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/Makefile   It would be nice if Fabric, itself, also included GoPkg.* at some point.  ></body> </Action>

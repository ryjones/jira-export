CDATA Hosts can be discovered from channel config (orderers) and discovery mechanisms (peers).  The static configuration holds settings for hosts such as grpc options, tls options, and connection endpoint.  Currently static configuration can only be used if the hostname from the network matches a hostname in the static configuration.  We should enable a matching mechanism to match the network hostname to a local configuration. This is useful for local development (i.e., localhost vs docker hostname).  We should additionally enable a matching mechanism for hostnames not known to the local configuration, such that default options can be provided. Ideally this would be a regular expression (or similar) matcher to allow different options to be applied based on the network hostname (e.g., different per domain).  Example location in configuration. Each host section (peer, orderer) could have a new field that holds the matching expression, and that field is then used to match against the discovered network name.  ></description> </Issue>

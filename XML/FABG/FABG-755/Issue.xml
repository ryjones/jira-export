CDATA Currently, Fabric Selection service uses the 'PrioritiesByHeight' priority selector. This selector tends to choose peers at the highest block height even though other peers are lagging only a block or two behind. After running some performance tests, we find that the load is mostly carried by only a few peers.  The Selection service should allow for a more even load distribution strategy for peers that are within a certain block height threshold. This should increase the throughput of the system as a whole.   ></description> </Issue>

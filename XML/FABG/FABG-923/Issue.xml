CDATA As with FAB-15795 we are trying to consolidate the assorted block metadata fields in use by the orderer under the single 'signature field'. The last config value is stored in the new way, but, it is still being written to the old location for backwards compatibility reasons.  The SDK should now use the last config index as found in the SIGNATURES field to retrieve the most recent config block.  ></description> </Issue>

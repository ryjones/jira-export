CDATA Currently, the only way to change channel configuration using SDK is to submit a pre-calculated channel update transaction.  Calculating a channel update transaction is not straightforward. From the client's point of view, it is desirable that SDK performs this calculation. In that case the client would only need to prepare updated channel configuration and submit to the SDK, which would then calculate and submit the channel update transaction to the orderer.  ></description> </Issue>

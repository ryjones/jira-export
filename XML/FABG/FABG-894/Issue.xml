CDATA *Current behaviour:*  the event client will disconnect from the peer if the peer's block height falls behind the specified number of blocks and will reconnect to a better performing peer. Â Note that this parameter is only applicable if peerMonitor is set to Enabled (default). Default: 10  *Proposal:*  Add a feature, if set to (0 or -1), event client disconnect should never happen.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA SDK configuration providers currently use CA name as the CA identity (lookup key). There are several problems with conflating the two. CA names might not be unique across the network (they are guaranteed to be unique only within one CA server instance). This also forces the CA definition to have CA name, which is optional and may not even be defined on the CA server.  CA should have an ID property independent from the CA name, to be used as a unique identifier of a CA within a network.  ></description> </Issue>

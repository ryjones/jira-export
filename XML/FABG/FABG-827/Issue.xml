For example, in the case that a user is revoked, you could shut down the clients associated with that user without affecting other clients." priority="3" resolution="10002" status="6" created="2019-03-06 13:00:22.0" updated="2019-03-06 13:17:01.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-06 13:17:01.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="49872"/>

CDATA Networks that take advantage of OU roles ( https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/membership/membership.html#node-ou-roles-and-msps ) don't work with GoSDK clients due to failures when validating certificates.  This is because it is invoking internal Fabric validation code which is sensitive to version.  This level of validation is not done by the Node and Java SDKs.  A simple fix to this is to change the version number which has been hardcoded here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/channel/membership/membership.go#L170      A PR is on its way.  Thanks!  ></description> </Issue>

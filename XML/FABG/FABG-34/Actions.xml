CDATA This is really a big problem because the sdk tries to connect to other peers when getting the TxStatus, but does not have the certificate in the certpool.  Scenario: - a larger network where multiple orgs are joined a channel - a new org is added to the channel - the org decides to join a peer to this channel - the discovery service returns this new peer for the channel - the sdk (running the whole time, e.g., in a microservice) does not load the new org certificate to the certpool - but tries to connect to the new peer for the TxStatus  {code:java} error registering for TxStatus event: could not create client conn: could not connect to peer0.org2.example.com:7351: dialing connection timed out  peer0.org2.example.com:7351  {code}   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently the versionCapabilityPattern in pkg/fab/chconfig/chconfig.go won't match version strings that have three version numbers like V1_4_3.  Suggest replacing the pattern with regexp.MustCompile(`^V(\d+)\_(\d+)(\_(\d+))?$`).  When the application capability version is set to V1_4_3 only, this should be good for all lower capability versions too. With this bug present, V1_4_3 is not treated as a version and so the capability V1_2 will not be recognized either and (for example) the discovery service won't work properly.  ></description> </Issue>

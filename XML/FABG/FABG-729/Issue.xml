CDATA {{credentialStore.path}}  is described as optional|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/5f9228a48662995608576b7e9aa3fdd548892679/pkg/core/config/testdata/template/config.yaml#L107 . In the template config file,  its value|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/5f9228a48662995608576b7e9aa3fdd548892679/pkg/core/config/testdata/template/config.yaml#L109  is set to {{unused/by/sdk/go}} when the {{cryptoconfig.path}} value is set to {{path/to/cryptoconfig}}.  As someone who wishes to use the SDK, I mimic this setup by setting {{cryptoconfig.path}} to the parent directory of {{cryptogen}}'s output for my network, and I omit {{credentialStore.path}}.  When I do that, I get the following error upon instantiating the SDK:  {noformat} failed to create state store: CreateNewFileKeyValueStore failed: FileKeyValueStore path is emptyexit status 1 {noformat}  Debugging this shows that the {{FileKeyValueStore}} actually _needs_ a value for {{credentialStore.path}}, contradicting the {{unused/by/sdk/go}} hint in the config template.  Even when this is set however, my victory in trying to tame the SDK is only short-lived. When I attempt to create a channel context, I get the following error:  {noformat} failed to create channel context: failed to get client context to create channel client: user not foundexit status 1 {noformat}  Debugging it leads me to the {{FileKeyValueStore}}'s key serializer. This function is programmed to look for my user's cert ({{User@MyOrgMSP-cert.pem}}) in {{credentialstore.path}}. However, this directory is empty.  So my question is: when should one expect the path specified in {{credentialStore.path}} to be populated with certificates?  ></description> </Issue>

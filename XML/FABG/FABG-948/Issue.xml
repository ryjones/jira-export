CDATA Currently version of msp.Enrollment don't provide a "WithHosts" options for enrollment operation, even though ca api expose this option in a field named CSR of type CSRInfo.  I think we should provide a WithHosts option, in some environments one dns entry for node isn't possible.  Real life problem:  we have production environments that for some especial characteristics can't use just CN for tls, but rather the machine's public/private ip as well. This can be done by adding these hosts to certificate SANs. I'm submitting a fix myself to this problem and hope that you point me how to finish the commit :)   ></description> </Issue>

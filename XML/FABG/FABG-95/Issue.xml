CDATA A client may not know the complete invocation chain when invoking a chaincode (i.e. the target chaincode may invoke other chaincodes) and therefore the transaction may fail due to insufficient endorsements. For example: * CC1 has policy (Org1 OR Org2) * CC2 has policy (Org1 AND Org2) * CC1 invokes CC2  A client wishes to invoke CC1 and the Selection Service calculates that only one endorser from either Org1 or Org2 is required, so a Tx proposal is sent to an endorser in Org1. As a result the endorsement policy will not be satisfied since CC2 also requires an endorsement from Org2.  Additional logic could be added to the Endorsement Handler in the channel client to automatically detect additional invoked chaincodes by reading the RWSets in the proposal response to check for all namespaces (chaincode IDs). If additional namespaces are found then the Selection Service would recalculate the required set of endorsers and requests would be sent to those additional endorsers.  ></description> </Issue>

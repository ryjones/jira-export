CDATA Gometalinter has been deprecated and will be archived (not deleted) on April 7th, see  https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/issues/590 .  It also either does not fully support go moduled projects, or only partially supports them - see  https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter/issues/562 .  They suggest users migrate to golangci-lint. This tool offers better documentation, is actively developed, and claims up to 5x better performance.  ></description> </Issue>

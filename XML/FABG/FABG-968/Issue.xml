<Issue id="45424" key="FABG-968" number="968" project="10610" reporter="JIRAUSER20257" creator="JIRAUSER20257" type="10004" summary="No payload in error response from chaincode" priority="3" status="10300" created="2020-06-22 02:12:58.0" updated="2020-06-22 02:12:58.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="59324" archived="N"> <description><! CDATA peer.Response struct has a Payload field. And in chaincode you can create response like this:Â  {code:java} pb.Response{ Status:  shim.ERROR, Message: "Unknown function call", Payload:   byte("some payload"), } {code} This response has valid form and should be received in Fabric SDK Go as-is. But somewhy it isn't. Go SDK cuts off payload from the error response. However, in Fabric SDK Java error response is received with the payload.  ></description> </Issue>

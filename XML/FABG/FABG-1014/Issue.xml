CDATA It throw Error When I perform fabric-samples/asset-transfer-basic/application-go  !image-2020-09-23-14-38-59-166.png!  and Orderer output Error TLS handshake failed  !image-2020-09-23-14-40-07-820.png!  I guess there is a problem with the certificate so wait 1 second after gw.GetNetwork. Because It seemed that the discovery service would need some time to retrieve the certificate. And I solved that but I still don't know the exact reason.  ></description> </Issue>

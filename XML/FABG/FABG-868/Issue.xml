CDATA I keep my ca/peer/orderer nodes in a private network behind some proxy that does TLS handshake with Letsencrypt generated certificates. Orderer and peer nodes have TLS disabled because traffic goes decrypted after passing through the proxy(Traefik).  It's not possible to connect to those nodes using HTTPS or GRPCS outside of the private network, because SDK requires TLS Root CA, which I don't have. I use Letsencryt for generating SSL certs and they can be validated with root cert of host OS. It's default behavioral of any HTTP client in any language:  if TLS ROOT CERT is not specified - use one from trusted in your OS.    https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/orderer/orderer.go#L78   The fix for it is one more condition, that checks if cert wasn't provided - use one from host OS.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Noticed that the CI was failing with this output:  *20:29:38* — FAIL: TestOrgsEndToEnd (0.68s) *20:29:38* test_setup.go:225: Error getting genesis block: Error sending envelope: error returned from orderer service: Got error status from ordering service: NOT_FOUND *20:29:38*  FAIL     This is most likely because the OrgsEndToEnd test does not wait long enough between create and join channel. Adding a longer timeout would give the ordering service enough time to create the genesis block.   ></description> </Issue>

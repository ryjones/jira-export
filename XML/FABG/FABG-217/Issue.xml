CDATA Currently, we are using same network config and other structs for config parsing as well as endpoint config function returns.  We should use separate network config for endpoint returns so that we can control the number of config entities exposed.  This change will also give an option to decouple identity config from endpoint config since both will use separate structs for parsing.  Note: TLSConfig struct should only be used for parsing, x509 certs should be returned in ' client, org, orderer, peer' TLS entities  ></description> </Issue>

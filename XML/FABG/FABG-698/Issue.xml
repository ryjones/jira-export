CDATA Currently when the event client connects to a peer, it remains connected until the idle timeout. In the case where a client is connected to a peer that has fallen behind in block height, the client will need to wait longer to receive events.  The event client should have a background routine that periodically checks the block height of the currently connected peer relative to the highest block height. If the block height lag reaches a configurable threshold, the event client should reconnect to another, more up-to-date peer.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I have written a go program following the test files for creating, initializing and joining the channel.  In the first run of the compiled go code, channel creation is successful but initialization and joining fails. However the second run of the compiled go code initialization and joining is successful.  So inorder to have all the three things done in one run of the code I had to put timeouts in between so that connection between the peer and orderer be established and request could be read.  Please look into this issue and resolve it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Note: ci.properties contains Go version that is needed by build machine, but it might not reflect right Go compiler. For example, existing ci.properties has 1.10 which is not enough information to test against with (we can compile sdk-go up to 1.10.3). Go versions higher than 1.10.3 have problems with metalinter (gofmt and goimports generate different outputs in some cases).   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26370/   ></body> </Action>

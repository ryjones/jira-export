CDATA When preparing the Go version of the  asset-transfer-basic| https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/asset-transfer-basic/application-go/assetTransfer.go   sample, which uses the gateway package, the following error is thrown:  {{Failed to submit: CreateAndSendTransaction failed: SendTransaction failed: calling orderer 'localhost:7050' failed: Orderer Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection on target  localhost:7050 : connection is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE}}     The orderer log indicates an incorrect TLS certificate from the client.     The Fabcar sample works fine which uses the same test-network and ccp (network-config) file.  The difference is that Fabcar calls EvaluateTransaction() before SubmitTransaction() whereas asset-transfer-basic calls SubmitTransaction() immediately following the initialisation of the channel.  Adding a short sleep before SubmitTransaction fixes the error, suggesting that the discovery of the channel config has not had time to complete.      ></description> </Issue>

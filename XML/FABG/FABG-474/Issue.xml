CDATA FAB-7513 introduces a key value store that supports MSP-like directory structure, the same that is currently used for pre-enrolled users (generated by the cryptogen tool). Also, the CredentialManager is modified to use this type of store for user private keys (in case of SW crypto provider) and user certs.  This ticket is about hiding the private key store behind the SW CriptoSuite wrapper, so the Credential Manager simply calls getKey(SKI) on the CryptoSuite as usual, and the CryptoSuite will get it from it's key store (file based in case of SW, HSM in case of PKCS11, etc).        ></description> </Issue>

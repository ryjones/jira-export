CDATA sudeshrshetty _*12:50 PM*_ endorsement from peer0.org2 means connecting to peer0.org2 You mean, previously it was getting tlsca cert from channel block and it was working and now it is not, right? Kyroy *_12:51 PM_* Yes. Sadly, I cannot remember the commit. But I know I was able to get endorsements without the tlsca cert  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Actually, the name of this issue and the content do not match. The sdk tries to connect to peer0.org2 for the TxStatus when I add the peer0.org2 to my `peers` without the `tlsCACerts`. But when I don't add it (which I would prefer), I want the sdk to get the endorsements from peer0.org2. But it does not do this.   ~sudeshrshetty   ></body> </Action>

CDATA In the current setup, Jenkins builds fabric images from scratch during each CI run. Now that we are only testing against tagged releases, we can use pre built images to save build time.  Note: We should still allow for the capability to build against targeted versions, if needed (to allow for development streams against master).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hey, I think there are some problems with the "access denied" close. When a peer is not joined to a channel, but the sdk tries to fetch the config, there is a "access denied" and now the sdk disconnects. So all later calls get a     {code:java} Discovery client has been closed due to error: access denied {code}    a) There is no obvious way to check `{{sdk.IsClosed()}}` b) The discovery service should not just close because of every access denied error      ~bstasyszyn   ></description> </Issue>

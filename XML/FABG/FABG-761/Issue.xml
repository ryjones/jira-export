CDATA Currently the event client uses an algorithm that chooses a peer whose block height is within a certain threshold of the max height. The event client should allow alternative peer resolving algorithms to be pluggable/configurable. For example:  - Simple load  balancing (not examining block height) - Preferring peers in the local org - Preferring a specified set of peers   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Story: As a user, I want to be able to view an ordered list of events that have occurred in each of my connections (relationships), so that my connections and their transactions are transparent.   This could be implemented by updating a histoy/timeline view when a connection is selected.   How to demo this: Show the ability to select each connection individually and have the historic view update accordingly.  ></description> </Issue>

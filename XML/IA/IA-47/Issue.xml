CDATA Create UI for credentials management. UI code is in Vue.js  Inspiration can (and should be) taken from the NodeJS Agent, where the UI is written in ReactJS. That code can be found here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/nodejs/ui/views   Interactions will be fake to see the different forms and UI elements. Access to the new ui should be through the currently non-working 'credentials' tab at the top.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As a user of a solution in the Indy ecosystem, I need a constantly connected cloud agent to ensure that my mobile edge agent does not miss important notifications.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Code is made part of public repositories in the Indy project. *  A binary package exists which can be executed with "java -jar cloudagent.jar" * The process runs a single cloud agent which can communicate with an open source edge agent such as the  Sovrin Connector App|https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/  * It includes manual build scripts sufficient for developers to work on the code base. * It runs on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 * Unit tests are included and can be manually executed by a developer. * Unit tests pass. * JIRA issues exist that document open issues and key decisions regarding what we did and what we decided not to do. * An architectural overview document, including an FAQ, is included in the code repository. * A CI / CD pipeline is running on Hyperledger infrastructure that builds and executes the unit tests.  *Notes* * The open source cloud agent needs to be sufficient for a technical person to run an agent for themselves on their own equipment. * It is expected to be implemented in Scala. * When agents are communicating with other agents, it is assumed that a mediator could be routing the messages.  *Excluded* These efforts are future work: * Removing dependency on Dynamo DB: IA-55 * Agent to agent protocol compatibility: IA-53  ></description> </Issue>

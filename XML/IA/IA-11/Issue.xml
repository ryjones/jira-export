CDATA Story: As a user I want to view a connections history.  The ui needs a place to display a connections history. This will be used to display a connection's timeline which in the future will include, connection request date, connection accepted date, and an ordered list of messages in plain text with corresponding timestamps.  How to demo this: Given an ordered list of events from a connections history, print them on the UIs history view, in historic order, with the ability to scroll.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Taking a first stab at this one myself.  Per some discussion (and for my own mental notes). Here's a rough draft of the flow: 1. Initialize agent with username and password which creates wallet (Alice)  2. Initialize a second agent using the same method above^ 3. Send credential offer (message family is state?)`Sending "\{"type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/sovrin.org/ui/1.0/state", "content": {"initialized": true, "agent_name": "Bob"}}"` 4. Receive? `{{Received "\{"type":"did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/sovrin.org/ui/1.0/state_request","id":"1ea43de7ae0f405b95fa3dca53843d6e","content":null}"}}  {{Also: if you already have the wallet configured, then state should return the proper info. the UI may need minor adjustment to skip that step.}}  {{and }}  also, we should not allow a message to set the wallet if one has already been set up.{{}}  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="53149" issue="34977" author="haggs" type="comment" body="So I&apos;ve got some hard-coded working versions of this going.  Curious if this approach resonates with  ~TelegramSam  or  ~dbluhm .   On launch, if a config file with wallet names, agents, and passphrases is present it will automatically load those and skip the login/wallet page. Alternatively this could be done by interacting with the Docker image with a bash script inside of the command line.  Thoughts? Both could be possible as well.

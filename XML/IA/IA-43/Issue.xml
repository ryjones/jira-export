CDATA Currently, you connect to the wallet via the  Web User Interface. We need a way to specify the same values on the command line so that on launch the agent is already connected to the desired wallet.   To connect, you need the wallet name and passphrase.  If the wallet connection information is not present on the command line, the UI should still ask for wallet connection information.  ></description> </Issue>

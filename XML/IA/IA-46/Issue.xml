CDATA Story:  As an agent, I need all persistence to be on the server.  Note:  This task is for setting up connection data to persist on the server in memory instead of the browser.  How To Demo: start up the agent server, open a browser and connect to the agent server, create connections, close browser, open a new browser, connect, and have the same connection that was created in the previous browser.   ></description> </Issue>

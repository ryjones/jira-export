CDATA Story: As a user I want to be able to accept or reject a connection/relationship request.  Each connection has a status, requested, request, established.  When a connection state is request, there should be a button that allows a user to accept that connection, all other connections should have a reject button.  To demo this: Correctly display a bottom on all connections that can be pressed.  (This task does not require the button to do anything.)   ></description> </Issue>

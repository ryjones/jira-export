CDATA I have taken an initial stab at stubbing out the functions needed to implement this module. Looking to submit it as a PR at some point but I think it should have the UI component before I do so (although I could be wrong on thisâ€“welcome feedback). I have commented out the function calls that will trigger the credentials code so that the agent can run as-is until we can test this code and skeleton the UI.  https://github.com/unveil-social/indy-agent/tree/nader-wip  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Story: As a user, I want to be able to manage my credentials by: * viewing my credentials and their status - IA-47 * send/receive a credential offer - (tasks to be added) * send/receive a credential request - (tasks to be added) * send/receive a credential - (tasks to be added)  Note #1: This is an implementation of Indy's Anoncreds, which allows the Reference Agent to be an Issuer, Prover, and Verifier.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/002-anoncreds   Note #2: This module heavily implies the parallel implementation of the Proofs module. The Credentials module outlined here can can cover issuing and holding credentials, but proving and verifying credentials should be handled by the Proofs module. Proofs are essentially a more specific case of Credentials, but the abstraction is still a useful one because of the added functionality needed.  To demo this: Show that each referenced task is completed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As an administrator maintaining a reference cloud agent, I want to use open source components to administer my deployment rather than having to subscribe to AWS Dynamo DB.  *Acceptance Criteria* * The reference cloud agent can be configured to use an open source key-value store, such as Cassandra or MongoDB.  *Notes* * An alternative implementation would be for it to manage it's key-value store in the same storage as the wallet, but that likely would take a lot of work.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Story: As a agent, I want to alert a GUI lite agent of an action that has taken place or be alerted of an action to take, so that a owner using a GUI lite agent can see/cause wallet state changes.  Note: This is a very raw idea and needs to be refined. This message type might be helpful for using the test suite. Set up the test suite as a GUI light agent so the test suite can simulate a owner issuing commands.  How to demo: Show documentation that's a result from an accepted HIPE PR.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Story: As Indy agent maintainer's, I want to be able to demonstrate multiple agent implementation using a single GUI, so that a GUI only needs to be written once, as well as a place for focus collaboration.  Note: This ticket is only about the existence of the GUI Lite Agent, no functionality.  How to demo: Provide a URL to a GitHub repo that has a readme with instructions on how to use the GUI given a reference agent.  ></description> </Issue>

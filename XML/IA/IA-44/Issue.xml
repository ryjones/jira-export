CDATA Story:  As an agent owner, I would like to define what type of messages my agent will acknowledge and execute on each connection.   Note:  This is connection permissions. this will allow an agent owner to prevent his agent from responding to admin type messages from unauthorized connections. this is a future feature, this task only needs empty calls where a permissions check would occur.  How To Demo: show exactly where a message permission check will be called and how it will prevent or support message execution.    ></description> </Issue>

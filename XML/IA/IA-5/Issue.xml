CDATA Story: As a developer, I want well written documentation outlining the design of the python agent, so that I can quickly understand the structure of the project.  This could include a diagram outlining code abstractions such as the security packaging , router handler, modules, UI, and supporting technologies.   To demo this: Have a diagram in the readme with architectural design details including file structure, code abstractions, and used technologies.    ></description> </Issue>

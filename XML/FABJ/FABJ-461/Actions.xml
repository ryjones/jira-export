CDATA It is possible to call theÂ {{GetConfigBlock}} transaction function on the {{cscc}} system chaincode to obtain the config block, passing the channel name as the only parameter. The implementation of this transaction function is here:    https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/47ac796cd668c4bf4c903882dd5986cb2a28b356/core/scc/cscc/configure.go#L294   You may need to use the compiled protobuf definitions in the SDK to unmarshall the block response.  ></body> </Action>

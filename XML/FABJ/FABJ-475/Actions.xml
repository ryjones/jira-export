CDATA The CR is not trying to include any jar by removing exclusion declaration.  Its removing unnecessary exclusion from pom.xml, as the protos and fabric jars are not present in the javadoc and code coverage jars in the first place. So, the exclusion code is not doing anything.  In other words, the jars which are being excluded from parent jars are not even present in the parent jar. The exclusion code is not doing anything.  Â   ></body> </Action>

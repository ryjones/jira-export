<Issue id="42281" key="FABJ-481" number="481" project="10605" reporter="coada" creator="coada" type="10001" summary="memberOnly* ignored for StaticCollectionConfig" priority="4" status="10100" created="2019-09-10 08:06:55.0" updated="2020-11-19 11:07:23.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="55335"> <description><! CDATA Currently creating a private data collection using the Java SDK ignores any {{memberOnlyRead}} or {{memberOnlyWrite}} attributes that can be added to the {{StaticCollectionConfig}} (see proto code  here|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/proto/common/collection.proto ).  The implication of this is that only private data collections can be created that allow the data to be accessed by non-org members.  The simplest scenario for this is a channel with one peer, however two organizations are part of the channel. A private data collection is then created on the peer which only allows one of the organizations to be part of, however the second organization is able to query this peer for collection data.  The fix needs to be done in the builder for the {{ChaincodeCollectionConfiguration}} (see code  here|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/ChaincodeCollectionConfiguration.java#L242 ).  ></description> </Issue>

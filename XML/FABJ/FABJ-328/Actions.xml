CDATA For now, we add the library in compiled form, as it is not available in some maven repository. The original library (* https://github.com/milagro-crypto/amcl *) must first be configured using a python script, which is what we did and the result is available at * https://github.com/manudrijvers/amcl/tree/master/java *. This code we compiled to obtain the jar we are including here.  There are plans to move the core idemix functionality into a separate repository containing the go, java, and node versions of the idemix core crypto, and then the amcl dependency would no longer needed in fabric-sdk, so we see this as a temporary solution.   ></body> </Action>

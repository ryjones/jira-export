CDATA There are my thoughts regarding this apis:  I guess we shouldn't expose fabric protos to end user, so it makes sense to add an additional layer of abstraction to wrap them in. The same way it's done for ProposalResponse.  As all peers have the same state it makes sense to query only the single one. Node js sdk uses concept of "primary peer" for querying it with requests like this one. I think it's fine to use similar approach in java sdk.  node js implementation for this feature could be found here : https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/5855/ common.proto contains Block related messages.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A good point to start is GetChainInfo method which returns the next proto: {code:java} message BlockchainInfo { uint64 height = 1; bytes currentBlockHash = 2; bytes previousBlockHash = 3; } {code} So i suggest to create BlockchainInfo class with the same fields to expose it to end users : {code:java} class BlockchainInfo { final long height; final byte   currentBlockHash; final byte   previousBlockHash; } {code}  ></body> </Action>

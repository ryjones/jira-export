CDATA Need to persist Chain info including chainID, members, trust store and other info so that apps can stop and restart without having to re-register users and rejoin channels.  Proposing something like a Properties class , say Class ChainPersistence { loadFromDisk(); saveToDisk(); setTrustStore(); getTrustStore(); setChainID(); ... and so on ... }  We can allow for different ways of actually persisting the info by overriding the saveToDisk() and loadFromDisk() methods.  Would think we can start off by just serializing the entire object to file.  ></description> </Issue>

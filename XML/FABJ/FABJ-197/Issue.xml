The peer cli does not check the create channel response status value as what the java sdk does. It continues to get genesis block. However, it is very likely the status value of the create channel response of a kafka orderer is 503. As a result, the fabric java sdk will throw a transaction exception and the whole channel creation will fail." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-07-19 06:27:23.0" updated="2018-07-19 00:20:42.0" resolutiondate="2017-08-15 15:43:57.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="33635"/>

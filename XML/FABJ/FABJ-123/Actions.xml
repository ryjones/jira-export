CDATA Rick Rine: FileLength: File length is 2,161 lines (max allowed is 2,000) eliminate  Allow line length up to 160 most screens have no problem with this. Allow underscores in var names .. somtimes this can make it more readable. Class Pair should be declared as final. remove ... I'd like to have the final say in this. OperatorWrap: '?' should be on a new line  remove see no issue with that.   Change  ERROR  to  WARNING  I want to scan builds for error don't think this should be caught.   Finally I don't want to see all this till we have it cleaned up to some degree:  done   Two plans: Submit small gerrit CC of 3 to 4 files each day to be reviewed that have ONLY fixes for style and don't impact highest JIRA work items under review. This should be quickly merged then.  Wait till V1.0 Highest Jira are done.  ></body> </Action>

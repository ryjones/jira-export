CDATA Hi, I am using the network-config.json configuration that comes with the 1.1.0alpha. It ready has the channel object foo in it. I am trying to use the NetworkConfig as a way to quickly access my network information.  The error I am getting is:  Caused by: org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.InvalidArgumentException: Can not add orderer orderer.example.com to channel bar because it already belongs to channel foo.     I made some functions based off of the End2endIT.java to create and join peers to a channel. I used the NetworkConfig that uses the profile from network-config.json only to access the peers/orderers endpoints and get the admin certificates.     I tried to comment out the fooChannel.shutdown in the End2endIT.java test to see if it throws the same error but it doesnt and goes on to creating channel bar also.  ></description> </Issue>

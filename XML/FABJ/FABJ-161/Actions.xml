CDATA How about something simple for now.  Suggestion we add to Config  a logLevel that returns an integer.   0 is NONE.  Which is the default. We wrapper those statements with:  if(config.getLogLevel() > 10){ logger.debug("blah blah blah ")  }  This won't break when and if we go to another logger .. which we may do.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We need to make sure the all the packages in use of fabric_ca are from the "org.hyperledger.fabric_ca.sdk"  package an not "org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk". One exception can be the CryptoSuite for now that's ok to use from the sdk There are other parameters missing from the various command we need to support.  If you look in the fabric_ca project  the swagger file  fabric-ca/swagger/swagger-fabric-ca.json  If you look at sdk Node you can see hints there on how these are invoked fabric-ca-client/lib/FabricCAClientImpl.js   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Do you mean you want to not only clean up RegistrationRequest but also refactor other classes in "org.hyperledger.fabric_ca.sdk" package as well? For example, HFCAClient uses lots of classes/interfaces from "org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk", such as Enrollment, GetTCertBatchRequest, and MemberServices. Do you want to move them to "org.hyperledger.fabric_ca.sdk"?    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Just got this on rocket chat .. and it affects the HFCAClient so can you clean this up too.  in the SDK User interface. User.getRoles  Should be changed from ArrayList<String> getRoles();  to >> Set<String> getRoles();   public interface User {  /** * Name - what identifies the user. * @return - User's name. */  String getName();  /** * The roles * @return */ ArrayList<String> getRoles();  ></body> </Action>

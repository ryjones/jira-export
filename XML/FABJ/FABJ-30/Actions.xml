I don't want to interpret what is being returned by the fabric server.  I also want to make sure we start moving all BouncyCastle code into CryptoPrimitivies   Maybe move this code to a new Class ChainUtils.java  where the user supplies blockNumber previousHash and DataHash  This makes it more obvious that what's being done is a calculation on what the Fabric is returning.  ></body> </Action>

But still, I don't understand the code {color:red}"EVENTHUB_LOCATIONS = Arrays.asList("grpc://localhost:7053");{color}" as I haven't found any document says there has a kind of node named "EVENTHUB", and what is the usage of the "EVENTHUB"? what types of the event is here targetting for? Besides, I found that it would set a block listener when the chain initialized, is there an interface to set the callback function for the listener? hope there would have more test case to indicate the usage about the "event"!  ></body> </Action>

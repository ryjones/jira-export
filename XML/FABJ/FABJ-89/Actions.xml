CDATA The goal here is that we have to publish the java artifacts- this is only for the Java SDK for utilizing the fabric. We published manually to NEXUS- so we have 1,0 artifact that we push manually.  So we are planning to implement this in CI, but we are stuck. We have to add GPG to sign the artifact... this is crypto signing that is required. Needs to happen with every merge to publish the snapshot. I asked Ry Jones to add the GPG items, but Ry indicated we don't follow that process. They are following a different mechanism.  Jessica from Linux Foundation is working on it at the moment. We need a target from Jessica as to when this will be completed.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Still working with Ramesh on this task, we need to work on adding the job to push the unsigned fabric binaries to nexus.hyperledger.org and still continue to be able to push to maven central.  For the signing process, we are using detached signatures for the moment rather than adding new GPG keys in the server. This means that Ry or I will be able to do this signing process.   I am at the moment trying my adjustments in the sandbox.   Hopefully I can finish this task this week or earlier.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Ramesh,   Sorry I forgot to tell you this yesterday since I was very busy with other tasks.   I was able to fix the java issue after checking the way other projects make this push.    https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/jar_test-Jess-1/  is my latest changes, and basically the idea is that we cannot be using the shell box for maven goals if we need to parse Jenkins maven settings files that contains the credentials and we will not be adding these credentials as part of Global Variables due to security reasons.  So, the idea is to use an actual maven step like i did in the job I linked you. We need to use the maven step for maven goals and not the shell box.  I will clean this up today and will update to your gerrit. I still need to move all the maven actions to that maven step   Thanks!  Jess.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for the update Ramesh,   To add to your comments:  Basically, before we started adding this "push to nexus.hyperledger.org" feature, the pom.xml had instructions to push to nexus central:   https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/   These push seem to have happened few times (maybe on demand) before I started helping in the team. My concern was, how were these binaries being pushed? Where they signed? Do we still want to continue making pushed to nexus central?  Checking with my lead, there is no other project making pushes to central due to the fact that the binaries don't meet the requirements to be added to the public. These binaries would need to be signed in order to be pushed to central, a big concern was how were these being signed and if the key was kept internal and secret still.   For now, I asked Ramesh to raise this concern and to ask to the leads if we need to continue doing these pushes.   Thanks!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks  ~rameshthoomu .  So maybe it needs time?    Can we get  ~venu.vemula  to test with FAB-3746 If it's really published that code should be able to reference 1.0.0-alpha2 without any need of specifying a repository in pom.xml or settings.xml This is really what matters.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="25393" issue="12950" author="rameshthoomu" type="comment" body="No.. This is a manual process and have to start the release process after the release tag/update the version in pom.xml. We can automate this process but have to generate and keep gpg keys in Jenkins CI.. As per  ~ryjones  it is not possible.  ~jwagantall  could you please take up this process. Will submit release process document in some time today for review. You can see the draft version here. https://github.com/rameshthoomu/sonatypejar/blob/master/Java%20Release.md" created="2017-06-05 16:50:06.0" updateauthor="rameshthoomu" updated="2017-06-05 16:50:06.0"/>

CDATA This is fixed and we are able to publish java jar to maven central. Created java release process document and you can find this in docs/ folder under fabric-sdk-java repository. With this approach we have publish 1.0.0-alpha2 and 1.0.0-beta release to maven central repository.   http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/  Will automate this process in Jenkins before we publish next release. Will create a new task for this item.. Closing this.  ></body> </Action>

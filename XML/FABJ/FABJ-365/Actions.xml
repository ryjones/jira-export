CDATA  ~gennadyl  for go chaincode, if ccenv is not available locally when go chaincode gets instantiated, peer will try to pull `latest` ccenv from dockerhub, like this: {code:java} 2018-09-17 17:03:18.458 EDT  util  DockerBuild -> DEBU 208 Image hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest does not exist locally, attempt pull{code} Question - if javaenv is not available locally when java chaincode gets instantiated, does peer attempt a similar pull?  Of course, for now there is no javaenv image on dockerhub so it would fail.  But I'm wondering if it would attempt to pull and succeed for customers, once javaenv gets published to dockerhub.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ah ok, so I finally understand the whole picture.  It works on ccenv because the peer chaincode instantiation automatically pulls the 'latest' released version from dockerhub, if it is not already local.  At this moment, that happens to be the v1.2 version of ccenv.  It works on javaenv consistently (which is what  ~rickr  has been asking for), except at this moment in time there is not yet a 'latest' version published to dockerhub since this is the initial release. So in the interim (for the next week) developers will have to pull javaenv manually (based on the instructions above or the upcoming script  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26254/ ).|https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26254/   Since this is just a moment in time problem, I will close.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Not sure about the Java SDK, but with the NodeJS SDK you can create (aka register) new users with membership services and then start up a new non-validating peer using the values (enrollID and enrollSecret) returned from the register command.  I will say that I'm not sure doing any of this is worthwhile at this point.  Non-validating peers don't really serve much purpose in the v0.6 architecture and we've remove the concept entirely in the new architecture which is under development in the master branch  ></body> </Action>

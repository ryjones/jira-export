CDATA Hi - how is what you doing different from the what is shown as an example of registering users:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/dbc41c1a119f9567ec7b39d972663813c45e0d04/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdkintegration/End2endIT.java#L283-L307  Please try following that.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you Rick for your quick response. I uploaded two screenshots for easy understanding of my issue.  (Though Fabric CA server returned a secret after successfully registered a user, but Fabric Java SDK used for client lose the secret.)  So far, I assume there has two ways to register user at least, a) invoke register function from HFCAClient, b) invoke create function from HFCAIdentity.  I have tried #a, and everything goes well. However, I got stuck into #b, and that is my question.     And if this is confirmed to be a issue, I guess the root cause is the following line:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric_ca/sdk/HFCAIdentity.java#L267   ></body> </Action>

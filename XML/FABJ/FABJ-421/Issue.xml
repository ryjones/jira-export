CDATA Gerrit CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/30095/    Recently, I tried to register a user instance with _create_ function provided by HFCAIdentity.  I expected that if register process is going well, I could get the secret returned from Fabric CA server. But actually, I could not.  I dug into the source code, and debugged the _create_ function, and found that seems to have unreasonable logic, which will lead to lose secret generated from Fabric CA server.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/release-1.4/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric_ca/sdk/HFCAIdentity.java#L267-L270   The issue is that if Fabric CA server normally returns register result, the status code of HTTP POST would be smaller than 400. Then identity could assemble itself. But current logic is just opposite.  Â   I am not sure if I missed anything and misunderstood it. And I am just a new-bee in Jira, not sure whether this is a duplicate case or not.  (If the issue is raised in a wrong Jira component (project?), please help correct it. Thanks a lot.)  ></description> </Issue>

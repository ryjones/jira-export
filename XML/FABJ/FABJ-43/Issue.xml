CDATA Review the design of Chain class. Muhammad Altaf Since we didn't add this parameter in this change, I am happy for this patch to go with it. However, I would like to revisit this design at some point when this patch has been merged. My take is that, the list of peers user adds to the chain object in SDK does not have to be all the peers in the chain. They can only add two peers and send them the proposal. Otherwise, what is the point of addPeer() method other than if user wants to initialize a new chain, in which case we can parameterize that method as well by sending a list of peers to the initialize.  Rick Rine We may want all the Peers in the Chain to be the default. But we need to allow them the option to override. There are other changes coming and this is not part of the work item for this change set.  ></description> </Issue>

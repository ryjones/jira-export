CDATA Apache Ant does not appear in the dependency tree for this project, either for the installed package or for the test plugins. So this vulnerability certainly does not exist at runtime.  A transitive dependency on Ant appears to exist somewhere within the Maven build tools themselves. Updating to the latest versions currently available of all the Maven plugins used does not solve the issue. Since we do not require Ant in this project, it is undesirable to add an explicit dependency on Ant to force a non-vulnerable version to be used during the build.  This potential vulnerability, which appears to exist only within our build pipeline, is not practical to fix.  ></body> </Action>

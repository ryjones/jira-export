CDATA It's not clear to me whether this is a subset of FAB-1678 or, whether this requires additional work for the java SDK.  FAB-1678 will provide a way to translate a config into a more readable/editable format (plain JSON with no nested marshaling), and provide a way to compute updates based on edits to this friendly format.  If this issue is requiring the the Java SDK to provide an interface for this, then this issue is capturing work not covered by FAB-1678.   If on the other hand, the idea is that the Java SDK does not provide an interface for this, and that the application directly interfaces with the APIs provided by FAB-1678 it on its own, then I see this as duplicating FAB-1678 (and it is inappropriately filed against the fabric-sdk-java component).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In theory, after reviewing the FAB-1678 information, the JIRA functionality could provide the necessary functionality that was being requested here via a different service context.  I would like to wait in closing this item until we understand better (play with) the functionality delivered by FAB-1678. As it is a separate service and service interface I need to understand the ramifications of this.  ></body> </Action>

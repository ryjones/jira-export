CDATA Users have requested the writing of a Network Configuration given a fabric and fabric ca.    NetworkConfig should have :   public static NetworkConfig fromNetwork(Channel channel, HFCAClient hfcaClient) throws InvalidArgumentException, IOException, NetworkConfigurationException {  }  Round trip  loading and writing is not required to preserve structure or comments.  Network network = Network.fromNetwork(channel, hfcaClient);  Additional libraries (dependencies) should only be used as a last resort.   void Network.toJsonFile(File jsonFIle){ }  void Network.toYamlFile(File jsonFIle){ }  Ideally internally it should produce the Json object then on yaml write convert to yaml formatl   ></body> </Action>

CDATA A channel configuration only  contains the members or orgs (MSPs) of the channel. Each member decides the nodes on the network, and due to privacy, only the member's peers know about each other. Each member includes a set of anchor peers (who have external endpoints) on the channel configuration to communicate (gossip) with other members' peers.  The current implementation leaves this task to the application to manage until we can support the concept of "submitting" peer as discussed in the  architecture document|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/proposals/r1/Next-Consensus-Architecture-Proposal.md .  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="22591" issue="15703" author="jimthematrix" type="comment" body="I&apos;m pretty sure the current implementation already supports both: getting a list of channels from a peer, and download the channel config that has the org MSPs and anchor peers (which allows you to get a list of endpoints to submit endorsement proposals).  ~timpii  can you verify this based on your requirements?" created="2017-04-17 15:45:38.0" updateauthor="jimthematrix" updated="2017-04-17 15:45:38.0"/>

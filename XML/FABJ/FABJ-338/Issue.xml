CDATA The discovery service can be used to query the peer membership in a non channel context.    This is done by issuing a  LocalQuery|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/protos/discovery/protocol.proto#L86 .   The motivation and justification for its existence is that an organizational administrator might want to have a dashboard application where it can see all the peers it has in its possession, and all the peers that the peers in its possession know about (i.e - peers from other organizations).  By default, the discovery service is configured to allow this query only to administrators of the peer itself, however  it can be configured|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L462  to disclose the information to any member of the peer's organization.   ~ptippett  - This one can be useful for you when/if you upgrade to v1.2 ;)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Rick, I would need some help in reproducing this, but first I have a recommendation for Di.  fabric-ca is in transition and we are breaking the server and client into 2 separate executables. See https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2012 We are almost complete and I'll update the docs when done and the fabric-ca executable will actually be going away.  So my recommendation is to use the fabric-ca-server command and see if this is still a problem. It is very easy to use.  To install both the client and server: go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/cmd/...  To start the server: fabric-ca-server start -u admin:adminpw  Arg, there is a change set which is about to be merged which changes the "-u" option to "-b" for the bootstrap user, so if "-u" doesn't work, try "-b" which is what it will eventually be.  This will create a default configuration fie for you with the "admin" user and password "adminpw" as the bootstrap user.  It listens with TLS disabled by default.  ></body> </Action>

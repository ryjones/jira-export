<Action id="23872" issue="16139" author="muralisr" type="comment" body=" ~timpii  There are two responses. One from the chaincode (inner response) and another from the peer (outer response). Currently the outer returns 200 &amp; 500 but this could become a proper range to drill into the type of error (and we can then have enums). The inner response should be preserved unmodified  (if the chaincode did execute).  CR 9213 and CR 9253 should make sure the above rules are met. Its up to the SDKs to use the actual responses appropriately. " created="2017-05-15 17:25:06.0" updateauthor="muralisr" updated="2017-05-15 17:25:06.0"/>

CDATA When we create connection to orderer in OrdererClient, we expect that this connection will be closed in finalize-method. But when we have a lot of connections (which were created by sending a many invokeProposals), JVM just doesn't have time to close OrdererClient by calling finalize-method where channel will be shut down.  Finally, we have got a NullPointer exception like this:  https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/2296  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi  ~maksimfedin  - I'm working through the java-sdk backlog with the maintainers, I think the files you've specified have since been added:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/proto/orderer/configuration.proto   So I'm going to close this - can you re-open it if you find this issue is still a problem? Thanks  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="54439" issue="35909" author="rickr" type="comment" body="With HSM the JSE private key is just token to the hardware private key. The token is new with each opening of the private key store (done by the application, not the SDK).  I think the SDK will work with HSM but we don&apos;t routinely test so it&apos;s not something we claim works.  I know of one group that got it working with Luna encryption cards.   I don&apos;t see any further requirements from the SDK." created="2018-12-06 13:25:42.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2018-12-06 13:25:42.0"/>

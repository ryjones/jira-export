CDATA The methods Channel.unRegisterBlockListener() and Channel.unRegisterChaincodeEventListener() should be renamed to Channel.unregisterBlockListener() and Channel.unregisterChaincodeEventListener() with a small r for register since the prefix un is not a complete word. These methods are new in v1.1-SNAPSHOT so we can still rename them freely.  The only callers are in Channel and End2endIT. I don't think there is a need to upload a patch, since it is trivial to rename with refactor in eclipse. I looked and there are no comments that need to be updated except this javadoc which should be also be updated by eclipse * @return Handle to be used to unregister the event listener {@link #unRegisterChaincodeEventListener(String)}   ></description> </Issue>

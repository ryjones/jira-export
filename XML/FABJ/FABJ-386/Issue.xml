CDATA Hi,  The class: ChaincodeCollectionConfiguration uses the javax.json.JsonValue's function asJsonObject (https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/json/JsonValue.html#asJsonObject-) that is available from specification version 1.1.  The problem is that not all providers support it. For example Apache Johnzon provider (shipped with TomEE docker image) does not support it.  I consider it as a small impact change that could make the life of the application builders/system integrator easier.     Best regards,  Venko Ivanov     PS. the exact line in the class (maybe not the only one) is: JsonObject jsonObject = j.asJsonObject();  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I create a hyperledger fabric network that has 2 organizations, Org1 and Org2. Each organization has 2 peers and has its own MSP. Then, I use fabric-ca to create a User1 that is a member of Org1 and I get the exception below sometimes when I try to initialize the channel having 4 peers from both organizations with User1.     org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.TransactionException: org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.ProposalException: getConfigBlock for channel mychannel failed with peer peer1.org2.example.com.  Status FAILURE, details: Sending proposal to peer1.org2.example.com failed because of: gRPC failure=Status\{code=UNKNOWN, description=Failed to deserialize creator identity, err expected MSP ID Org2MSP, received Org1MSP, cause=null}     at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.Channel.parseConfigBlock(Channel.java:1168)     at org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.Channel.initialize(Channel.java:948)     I will get the exception if SDK try to get the configuration block from Org2 peers. I look into the Channel.parseConfigBlock() and find that the method randomly selects the peer from all peers added to the channel in order to get the configuration block. Is it possible to filter the peer list with the user MSP before selecting or provide some way to choose the peer for getting the configuration block?   I need to add peers from both organizations to the channel because a proposal need to be signed by both organizations.  ></description> </Issue>

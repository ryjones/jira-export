CDATA Whenever we tries to register a new user using fabric-java-sdk having OU as admin or peer, it creates Identity with OU client independent of Type we passed in request  RegistrationRequest registrationRequest = new RegistrationRequest(USER); registrationRequest.setAffiliation(DEPTT); registrationRequest.setEnrollmentID(ENROLLMENT_ID); registrationRequest.setType("admin");  It alway register user with OU as client irrespective to the type we provide.  Whenever we require to fetch some details from ledger like  =>   Fetch list of Installed Chaincodes or Committed Chaincodes =>   Joinning Channel  we require a user to be registered with OU as admin as given in ACL.  So if user not registers with OU as admin then we can't be able to fetch details from channel.  However it is working fine with fabic-node-sdk  , it register users with desired OU we provide  ></description> </Issue>

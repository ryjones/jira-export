CDATA In -FAB-7702- we changed getting the channels config block from the orderer to the peer.  However this has issues that peers from other organizations which we want to get endorsements from don't seem to allow this.  The getConfigBlock will work for peer's in the same organization.  We either need to revert this for now or provide a means for applications to identify peers that are not part of it's organization.     Gerrit: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17705/  ></description> </Issue>

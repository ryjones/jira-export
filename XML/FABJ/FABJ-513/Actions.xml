CDATA > This was stale but unfortunately as far as I can tell, still needed. Do you prefer re-opening this ticket or having a new one created?  This was closed along with over 700 others that had not received an update in over nine months. If it's still something that should be tracked, feel free to reopen it and remove the {{stale-item}} label. I'd also recommend moving it to the {{Fabric SDK Java (FABJ)}} project as this is related to the Java SDK.  As a member of the community with an interest in this item, it would be great if you could submit a PR that creates this missing documentation; your contribution would be welcome.  ></body> </Action>

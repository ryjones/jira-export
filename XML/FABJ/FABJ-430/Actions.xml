CDATA The specification: Connection profile did not include a means to set these.   There is a way applications can adjust these. The channel returned by loading the channel is not initialized.  The application can before initialize query the peers on the channel, what properties it has and what options (getPeersOptions).   The application can then remove the peer and add it back with whatever properties or options it wants.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Rick,  Thank you for the advise, but it seems like a workaround to me. Is it not the purpose of NetworkConfig class to handle the configuration automatically?  If we remove peers after channel is returned and then re-add them manually it looks like duplication of some logic which is built in into NetworkConfig.  And this duplication must be done by every developer. Who wants to use this functionality.  Can this at least be reopened with very low priority?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you Rick for your code change.  I tried the workaround you had suggested, and it did not work, because if I remove peer from channel, it executes shutdown peer  {code:java} public void removePeer(Peer peer) throws InvalidArgumentException { if (shutdown) { throw new InvalidArgumentException(format("Can not remove peer from channel %s already shutdown.", name)); } logger.debug(format("removePeer %s from channel %s", peer, toString()));  checkPeer(peer); removePeerInternal(peer); ----> peer.shutdown(true);  } {code}  And there are no methods that would allow to switch on this peer. The only option I see is to create peer form scratch, and re-parse yaml/json config and to reimplement all logic from NetworkConfig used for peer creation. This does not look like a plausible workaround.  Please let me know if there is any easier way  ></body> </Action>

And you can remove the peer, it shuts down.  Then create a new peer from that one (name, url, properites et al) then add that one.  I'll admit it's ugly but only way I know without this code change.  ></body> </Action>

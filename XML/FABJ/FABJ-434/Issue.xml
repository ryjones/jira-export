CDATA _Gerrit CR  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-sdk-java/+/31532 _   _As a_ user of the Java SDK _I want to_ identify the organization (MSP ID) to which peers belong _So that_ I can obtain query results and receive events from peers within specific organizations  The SDK implementation already has access to organization information for peers through both the connection profile and through discovery. This information should be made directly accessible to client code through the SDK. This capability is already offered by other language SDKs.  Trying to obtain this information through the existing API is currently: # Cumbersome. # Does not guarantee consistency as the network topology evolves over time (particularly in the case of removal of peers).  Examples of use cases are: * Wait for commit events and send queries only to peers within my organization, for performance, consistency, and because I trust my organization peers not to be malicious participants in the network. * Direct queries to specific organization peers, such as a regulator, which can not reasonably be otherwise determined in a real-world network where member peers change over time and discovery is used to propagate network information.  ></description> </Issue>

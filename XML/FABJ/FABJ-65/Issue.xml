CDATA MemberServicesFabricCAImpl generates certificate requests to fabric-ca so that it can get back signed certificates. This is done using classes and methods from the BouncyCastle library.  We do not want to propagate use of BouncyCastle throughout the SDK. Rather, we want to put all the crypto functionality into the CryptoSuite interface and let implementers handle which security provider they want to use.  If we add methods for certificate request generation to CryptoSuite, we are forced to declare methods using BouncyCastle classes as Java does not have a standard API for cert requests.  Possible course of actions: 1. Investigate again if Java has a standard API for certificate requests and use it 2. separate fabric-ca integration out of the SDK so that CryptoSuite only deals with keygen/signing/verification  ></description> </Issue>

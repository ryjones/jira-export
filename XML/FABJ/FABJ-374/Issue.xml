CDATA The Fabric Peer used to return to the SDKs just two values for Payload Status 200 for succes or 500 for failure.  This was irregardless of what the Java chaincode returned. A change in 1.2 changed this to return to the SDK the Status  set by the chaincode.  Any Status 400 or greater returned by the chaincode to the Peer causes the Peer to not endorse the transactions.  The SDK need to take this into account to setting the Success to any value less than 400   Gerrit PC https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/26942/  ></description> </Issue>

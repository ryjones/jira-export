CDATA My intention is to create a channel for multiple orgs by javaSDK.  I tested goSDK is good for multiple orgs using this tx file:  ` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/fabric/v1.1.0-alpha/channel/orgchannel.tx `  Cause there is no example for multiple orgs channel by javaSDK,I did this test.  Firstly,I constructed a channel by this tx file and joined peers of org1 successfully,but joined peers org2 failed because signature.  Then,I reconstructed this channel ,and joined peers org2 successfully by MSP org2 's admin user.  Lasted,when excuted channel.initialize(),it got error message :  "Handler dispatch failed; nested exception is java.lang.AssertionError: org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.EventHubException: UNKNOWN: event message must be properly signed by an identity from the same organization as the peer:  failed deserializing event creator:  Expected MSP ID Org1MSP, received Org2MSP  "     For org1,Channel addEventHub by client of org1's  admin user.     If this is not a BUG,given a example for multiple orgs please!  ></description> </Issue>

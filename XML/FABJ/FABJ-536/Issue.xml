CDATA Fabric CA supports mutual TLS:  https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/deployguide/ca-config.html#tls .  However HLF Java SDK doesn't support padding the client side certs for the mutual TLS handshake and therefore the Fabric SDK cannot be used with mutual TLS enabled Fabric CA server.  This feature is very important for many cases where mutual TLS is required for security reasons.  We have developed the feature in  https://github.com/senofi/fabric-sdk-java/tree/1.4.7.senofi  and can help the project team to implement it if needed.

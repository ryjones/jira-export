CDATA Currently the only way the completion of the transaction future is when all eventhubs and peer eventing services has reported seeing the block with the transaction.  This behavior is definitely not applicable to all usages.  With this change applications can on each transaction sent to the orderer specify which eventhubs or peereventing services by a group of NoF and how many in that group need to satisfy the condition for the future to be completed.  There is also an option to allow no events to be waited for only the successful or failure on all orderers to receive the transaction.  Current behavior is also that all eventhubs and peer eventing services would need to have seen the transaction before completion even for failed ones.  The default behavior is now to fail fast with an option to allow the old behavior.     Gerrit: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/19123/  ></description> </Issue>

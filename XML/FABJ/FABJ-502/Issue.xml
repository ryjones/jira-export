CDATA Channel.sendTransaction has a few threads that can result than a completeExceptionally being returned but the error never being logged within the SDK code.  If the client application does not log the received completeExceptionally contents then the error can be lost rendering support activities difficult.  Suggest adding logger.error before the twoÂ  completeExceptionally returns.  ></description> </Issue>

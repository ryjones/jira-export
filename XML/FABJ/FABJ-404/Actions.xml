CDATA Not seen any movement here so I'm setting unassigned.   ~C0rWin  Would it be sufficient to provide the application the opportunity to set the thread factory or is it necessary to set the ExecutorService?  In both cases, I have an issue if it's created the threads need to be daemon threads or app will hang on ending, but  I guess that will then be the application's responsibility   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The vm (aka application) won't end till all non-daemon threads are gone.  The SDK explicitly changes in the executor service treads to daemon so it doesn't cause the hanging of an application (not exiting)  on its threads even if the application doesn't properly shutdown the channels before ending.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA So I will address this JIRA by allowing the application to override the executor service on the client  It will be on time set that needs to be done *before* anything else.   ></body> </Action>

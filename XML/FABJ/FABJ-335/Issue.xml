CDATA The discovery service caches signatures of queries and when TLS is employed - this allows a client to send the same query multiple times to the discovery service without the peer needing to verify signatures, given that the signature is reused, and it is in the cache of the peer and that no config update occurred that made the cache be wiped out.     The java SDK implementation doesn't cache the signatures, and thus even if it sends the same query to the peer over and over again - it signs all over again.  It can be nice if the node SDK caches the requests and their corresponding signatures sent to the peer(s) and this would reduce CPU cycles in the server side.      ~rickr  please correct me if something is wrong about the java SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

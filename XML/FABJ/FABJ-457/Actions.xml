CDATA This has been untouched for quite a while now. Have you found a workaround or is this still an issue?  For reference, SDK development effort is currently focused onÂ a new cross-language  Fabric Gateway|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway  client API, to provide a more consistent and easier application development experience across Java, Node and Go programming languages. Although this is certainly not yet ready for production use, this API gives the  application control over how the client gRPC connection is created|https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/main/api/java/  and so should neatly solve this issue by allowing you to use  {{ManagedChannelBuilder.forTarget()}}|https://grpc.github.io/grpc-java/javadoc/io/grpc/ManagedChannelBuilder.html#forTarget-java.lang.String-  directly.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Some of the .protos files have `option java_option` and `import` statements that are not in the versions in hyperledger/fabric/protos.  Also `identities.proto` is in hyperledger/fabric/msp and not in hyperledger/fabric/protos   Clean up so that we have one official version of the files in one location (probably hyperledger/fabric/protos) and have the SDK builds automatically copy from there as needed.  ></description> </Issue>

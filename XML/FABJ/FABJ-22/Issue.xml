CDATA Current during chaincode install, the SDKs (at least node and java, not sure about python and go) simply sends a ChaincodeDeploymentSpec payload to the peer, which then wraps it into a SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec with a default instantiation policy (requires one org admin signature).  Should add support for custom instantiation policy in the chaincode install APIs, allowing the custom policy to be specified in the same syntax as the endorsement policy (because instantiation policy syntax is the same as the endorsement policy).  ></description> </Issue>

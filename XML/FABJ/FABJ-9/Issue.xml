CDATA Currently in End2end tests both GO and Java we don't test the block that is returned on transactions.   I understand that it's difficult to determine from this block whether the transaction actually succeeded.   We should investigate returning  a wrappered class on this  block that simplifies the testing if the transaction actually completed.  Both End2end for GO and Java should then be fixed up to take this into account.   ></description> </Issue>

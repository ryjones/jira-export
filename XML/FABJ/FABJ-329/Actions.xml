CDATA The only case I think where this is most likely to occur is with  grpcOptions.  How about a properties when doing the NetworkConfig.load  orderers.\{.*}.grpcOptions.negotiationType.default=TLS  # default if not supplied  \{<>} means <> is a regex expression  orderers.*name*.grpcOptions.sslProvider.override=openSSL   # name= exact name ... override it     ></body> </Action>

If the protocol is SSL (grpc) the most likel cases are  negotiationType TLS and  sslProvider is openSSL.  So if they are not provided in the specific properties for the endpoint instead of throwing an exception use a global configuration default for them. " created="2018-04-09 00:44:58.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2018-04-09 00:44:58.0"/>

CDATA You don't want to throw it back on the caller to have a chance - or the responsibility - to modify the properties appropriately?  Delegate pattern perhaps?  At least that way it's extensible down the line if something else comes down the pipe.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The fabric-sdk looks as though it can take a connection profile with no channel definitions but the apis focus around starting with a channel. Fabric-Gateway-Java gets around this by building the required internal objects from the NetworkConfig instance created from the CCP however Fabric-Gateway-Java only provides a subset of capability of the fabric-sdk-java so users could still have a need to use the fabric-sdk-java in order to complete their requirements.   I know that it would be possible to use fabric-gateway-java getChannel method on the network instance to get around this but would be good to allow users the choice of just using the java-sdk standalone   ></description> </Issue>

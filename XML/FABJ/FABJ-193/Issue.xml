CDATA I'm wanting to add the sdk to my Ant build (using Ivy). Is this possible? I add the entry {code:java} <dependency org="org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java" name="fabric-sdk-java" rev="1.0.0" /> {code} Â but get the following errors on resolve:   {code:java} Some projects fail to be resolved Impossible to resolve dependencies of io.idvc#cooperative;working@Jordans-MacBook-Pro.local unresolved dependency: org.apache.maven#maven-plugin-api;${project.prerequisites.maven}: not found unresolved dependency: org.apache.maven.reporting#maven-reporting-api;${project.prerequisites.maven}: not found unresolved dependency: org.apache.maven#maven-project;${project.prerequisites.maven}: not found {code} I added those dependencies manually and everything seemed to build, but it requires a ton of dependencies. I notice the maven pom appears to go through several configuration steps during the build. Is there a way around this in Ivy?  ></description> </Issue>

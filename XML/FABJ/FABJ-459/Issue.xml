CDATA When attempting to submit a transaction through a client app using the java sdk, I see: {noformat} Caused by: org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.TransactionException: Channel mychannel, send transaction failed on orderer OrdererClient{id: 14, channel: mychannel, name: orderer.example.com:17053, url: grpcs://orderer.example.com:17053}. Reason: UNAVAILABLE: Unable to resolve host orderer.example.com{noformat} Because I don't have `order.example.com` specified in `/etc/hosts`, nor orderer specified in my connection profile, and there's no option to set `asLocalHost` as there is with node.   I think this needs some thought/discussion if we don't want to provide the same `asLocalHost` functionality available in node. i.e. some docs to explain the setup needed, or a better explained error message?  If the answer is to have orderer specified in the connection profile, then this shouldn't be closed until I've raised an issue with the vscode extension, to ensure they specify the orderer in the local_fabric connection profile, as and when they properly support the new programming model in java  Â   ></description> </Issue>

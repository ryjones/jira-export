CDATA If idemix is optional and even the fabric CA is optional it can not break the existing interface.  There is NO details here on why or how this is to be implemented.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The current design defines a User interface with two implementations: one for x509 ecerts and one for idemix. There is then nothing that relates the two user objects to one another, even though they are the same person.  I think a better design is to define a Credential interface with two implementations: one for x509 ecerts and one for the idemix credential. The User object has multiple Credential objects just as a single user can have both a drivers license and a passport.       ></body> </Action>
<Action id="44748" issue="23231" author="smithbk" type="comment" body="Angelo, my apologies.  I agree with you that an IdemixUser object is needed.  I thought the User object corresponded to a real user, but it is really a user&apos;s context.  I think it should have been called UserContext instead of User, but too late for that." created="2018-05-21 16:21:26.0" updateauthor="smithbk" updated="2018-05-21 16:21:26.0"/>

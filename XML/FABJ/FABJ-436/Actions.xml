<Action id="59706" issue="39589" author="rickr" type="comment" body="The logs for fabric don&apos;t appear to be at debug level.  The SDK logs also need to be at trace level.  The SDK readme.md has some mention on setting trace.  The SDK&apos;s docker-compose.yaml also has by default the full logging on the fabric side- if that does not work see fabric documentation." created="2019-05-03 12:21:38.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2019-05-03 12:21:38.0"/>

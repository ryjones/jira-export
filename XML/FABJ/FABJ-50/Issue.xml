CDATA Tcerts need be down loaded from fabric_ca in batch converted so they can be used for transactions instead of Ecerts   Users will need to create a TCertSpecification which will have all the attributes wanted for the TCerts that will be created for it.  Users can create different TCertSpecification instances for each TCert type they wish.  There will be a specific TCertSpecification for just using ECerts .. this is to make sure the user really wants this and has not just forgotten to just set the TCertSpecification on the proposal.  It will be an error to not have a TCertSpecification on the proposal creations.    Each TCertSpecification instance  will have a separate prefetch queue that will have TCerts that match the specification.  TCertSpecification instance will have a batch size and low water mark that will trigger fetching  new TCerts from the Fabric CA asynchronously.   User can change batch size and low water mark but rest of the TCertSpecification will be immutable.  The TCertSpecification will have a discard method that will clean up all resources for that instance.    Other than creating a TCertSpecification instace and setting it's attributes, calling destroy the end user of the API will not do much with interacting with TCerts themselves.  TCerts should be handle by SDK as transparently as possible.  ></description> </Issue>

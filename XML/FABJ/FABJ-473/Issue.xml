CDATA Hello,  I've been trying to create a Private Data collection using the Fabric Java SDK. Creating a {{ChaincodeCollectionConfiguration}} however _requires_Â me to add the property {{StaticCollectionConfig}}, or a {{ChaincodeCollectionConfigurationException}} is thrown. There is no documentation whatsoever about this property in  https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data-arch.html .  It seems that this property was removed in FAB-9202, so I would ask that this is removed in the Java SDK too or made clear why it is even needed.  ></description> </Issue>

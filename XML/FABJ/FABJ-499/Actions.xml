Your solution looks reasonable, although I would prefer the use of an AtomicReference rather than a transient variable.

And I am wondering if I have to make same separate request on the branch release-1.4, since I am using version 1.4.0 on the production so upgrading to upcoming 2.0 would be a big change. I’d like to know the release plan of 2.0, or 1.4.7(might be better for me), if you have any." created="2019-12-20 06:48:17.0" updateauthor="tommy-park" updated="2019-12-20 06:48:17.0"/>

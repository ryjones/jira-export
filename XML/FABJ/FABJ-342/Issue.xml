CDATA Orchestrate the tests associated to the code the CRs of this epic include.  Before closing this testplan task, coverage must be reviewed and approved (via upvote or comment) by the epic feature owner and the test leads identified below.  +*Location / Description of*+ docs, APIs, config vars, system configuration (fabric, SDKs, fabric-samples) :     +*Unit Test (UT) leader*+:  ~dubovitskaya   Automated unit tests are merged in repo, as go tests or otherwise part of build/verify jenkins jobs. Code coverage tracked in Jenkins:  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/Daily/job/fabric-unit-test-coverage-daily-master-x86_64/    Unit Test Coverage is 92% on average.  +*Function Test (FVT) leader*+:  ~dubovitskaya  In v1.2 the peer is not well structured for integration tests, therefore we will compensate with expanded Unit tests and expanded E2E tests using ginkgo. Describe function test coverage approach here:     E2E testcases scenarios (Add one individual jira TASK within this feature Epic for each of these) :  End2endIdemixIT.java ( FAB-10351) End2endIT that is modified for Idemix to do the following: # E2E Test (Manual): IdentityMixer Client(SDK) attempts to get an Idemix enrolment certificate from Fabric CA, create an IdemixSigningIdentity. # E2E Test (Manual): IdentityMixer Client (SDK) attempt to invoke a chaincode by submitting a proposal and then transaction to the network.     +*System Verification Test (SVT) leader*+:   SVT: run End2endIdemixIT.java in MT (FABJ-363 )  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~rickr  Are you sure the fix versionÂ  is correct? I have this logging in fabric-sdk-java v1.4.4  And second question: are you sure error level is appropriate level for this? We use global orderer endpoints configuration and we have a lot of errors on client side: "Service discovery in channel: general, ... found Orderer endpoint: orderer:7050 with two mspids: 'node3', 'node1'". We think this isn't an error at all :)  ></body> </Action>

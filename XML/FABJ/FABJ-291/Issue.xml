CDATA When attaching to a channel using a generated network configuration access to the channel and peer attributes - preferably by name but I'd take the map and parse - is required. This is a typical channel response: "some-channel": \{ "x-status": "membership_valid", "orderers":   "orderer"  , "peers": \{ "org2-peer1": \{ "x-chaincode": \{ "sacc": \{ "version": "1.0", "path": "ibm-bcs-<obscured>" } } } }, "chaincodes":   "cc:1.0"  , "x-members":   "org1", "org11", "org2"   },    Two concrete examples to aid understanding. # I need to handle events thrown by a channel under certain circumstances. These require the application to post to a different channel inside the event listener. The easiest way to make sure everything works as I would like it to is to connect to all the channels as part of the application initialization. Knowing if a channel is valid to connect to (so access to the x-status) is useful. # Per 1 - I need to add different event handlers to deal with different chaincodes. Knowing what's on this channel is necessary to allow this to be automated.   I get I can parse the nodes manually, but there are getters/setters for pretty much everything else in there so this would be a nice to have.  ></description> </Issue>

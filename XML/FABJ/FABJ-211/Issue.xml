CDATA Java SDK 1.1.0alpha is failing to parse network-config.json at 2 points.  For CertificateAuthority objects, the specific registrar object value is an Array that holds the registrar objects of enrollmentID and enrollmentSecret. This causes the enrollId and enrollSecret to be null when created inside the NetworkConfig.java createCA method specifically at the getJsonValueAsObject line 792 because jsonCA.get("registrar") returns null. I resolved this issue on my end by removing the brackets    from the registrar property in the json file as this makes more sense because there can't be multiple registrars. I have noticed this registrar property as an array in the network-config.json and also in the IBM Blockchain Service servicecredentials.json  gerrit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20295/  ></description> </Issue>

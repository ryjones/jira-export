CDATA  ~rickr  As part of CI process, Daily we are publishing stable images to a test public docker hub repository if e2e (cli) and e2e (node) executes successfully. Recently we have also included e2e (java) to this process.. But will take a decision whether to publish images based on all above 3 tests or cli and node is fine..   Updating Build result and Images references to #fabric-ci rocket chat channel.  Please let me know the commit numbers to update in docker-compose file to pick only those commits from test dockerhub repository.. Note: Image building is not taking much time now a days..    ></body> </Action>

There is clearly a sleep here in the default disconnect/reconnect handler:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/043af8728c5338cb6b4ee69bc76bc27ef4c721d6/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/Peer.java#L532   Maybe the reconnect is happening down a different code path, or this sleep is interrupted for some reason?  ></body> </Action>

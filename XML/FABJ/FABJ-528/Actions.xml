CDATA It looks like this was changed in commit 6db3212a3c6260dbd95e958acbe03bcdb60873f7. The integration tests are now run in a single step using the script {{scripts/run-integration-tests.sh}}. The need to manually pull Docker images and run the {{src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/fabric.sh}} script is removed.  You are correct that the README should be updated.  ></body> </Action>

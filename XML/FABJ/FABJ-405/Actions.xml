CDATA This test is done on the SDK to pre-check if there are consistency issues and also the utility in the SDK to give applications even the possibility to pick a consistent set. The sdk will by default verify this when the endorsements are sent to the orderer.  This can be turned off with the environment variable set to false. ORG_HYPERLEDGER_FABRIC_SDK_PROPOSAL_CONSISTENCY_VALIDATION export ORG_HYPERLEDGER_FABRIC_SDK_PROPOSAL_CONSISTENCY_VALIDATION=false.  To date I have not seen where the sdk has reported false positives. If they are inconsistent then the committers (peers) should fail the transactions.  So I would test with this off.  Most likely your chaincode is producing transactions on endorsers that are inconsistent as I have not also heard of any cases where there are issues in this area.   Run your stress test with this turned off and not doing the checking on the client side and see if then it occurs -- make sure you check that the transactions are marked valid.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, so there's no issue with the SDK.  Your chaincode is producing inconsistent results or the shim/peers endorsers are wrong.  I can't believe the peers or shim have issues because no one else is reporting this.   Also you need to make sure that any peer you are endorsing on has seen any previous transactions if they are dependent on each other.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'm closing this as I don't see from the conversations that it is an SDK issue the transactions are also marked bad by the committers.  So if you feel the transaction really isn't inconsistent then you need to open this up with the Fabric project.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The Fabric CA supports on revoke an option for gencrl to be returned, but is missing in JSDK api.  Need to include this and provide the gencrl back in the response.  Also some parameters are not being handled correctly like *reason* which can be missing  (aka null) but the HFCAClientIT will throw an npe if not there.   Need to have unit testcase for this also fixed up.  ></description> </Issue>

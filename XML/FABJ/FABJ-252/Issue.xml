CDATA MacOS Sierra  Java 1.8.0_60-b27  ></environment> <description><! CDATA I am using Hyperledger Fabric 1.0.1. Right now, I am playing with basic Java SDK capabilities against Fabric networks from "first-network" and "fabCars" samples.  I am able to connect to the channel or query the data but there is an issue when I want to send transaction in order to write some data. In fact, the data are written, however my code hangs in channel.sendTransaction().get() call - seems like some event is not properly fired or captured.  CompletableFuture<BlockEvent.TransactionEvent> txFuture = channel.sendTransaction(addCarProposals, client.getUserContext()); BlockEvent.TransactionEvent event = txFuture.get(600, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  If txFuture.get() call is commented out, the application proceeds further.  Just to note - query and invoke ran via Node.js SDK proceed without any issue. All Docker containers seem running fine, there are no networking issues... Any event handler needs to be initialized first for a channel? I have no clue.   Attached is the example source code I am using and part of the log from the peer showing that the data are written fine and new blocks created.   Regards Petr  ></description> </Issue>

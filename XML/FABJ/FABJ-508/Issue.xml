CDATA Even when throwing ChaincodeException in the java chaincode, Fabric SDK Java just checks if response is invalid (ProposalResponse.java line 271) and throws a   InvalidArgumentException("Proposal response is invalid.");  This should include the error message returned by grpc protocol so client app developer can show the corresponding log in the client application and does not relay on peer node internal logs to know what problem was in the chain code.  ></description> </Issue>

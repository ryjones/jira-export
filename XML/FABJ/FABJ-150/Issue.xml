CDATA User is to create policies using a Fabric tool that outputs serialized Policy objects as a file or byte array.  SDK is to read these files/byte arrays for use in creating chaincode instantiation requests or other configuration requests.  We need to agree on a naming convention for these files amongst node sdk, java sdk and Fabric teams.  Current conditions: Fabric has not written this tool but has the policy generation code as part of the CLI code.  Node SDK does not plan on reading in Policy files, only byte arrays.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="23799" issue="16497" author="venu.vemula" type="comment" body="Progress so far: Wrote a skeleton maven project which would download JAVA SDK jar from Nexus repository and uses it . Can see fabric-sdk-java-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar successfully getting downloaded from https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots.. and the sample app can successfully use Fabric Java SDK classes. Currently working on expanding the application to have end to end scenarios." created="2017-05-12 13:21:36.0" updateauthor="venu.vemula" updated="2017-05-12 13:21:36.0"/>

CDATA Needs to validate FAB-648  Remove all reference to snapshot repositories and reference alpha2  Clean out any dependencies in .m2 directory  Docker images of Fabric should be pulled from alpah2 images and not built locally.  Run this application and make sure all dependencies are pulled down including HLF JSDK jar and this application successfully runs.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA came up with initial version of end of end sample .. and uploaded to public git  https://github.com/venugopv/FabricJavaSDKSample/blob/master/README.md .  However the sample as of now uses Fabric Java SDK jar downloaded from nexus.  Next steps ======== Once FAB-648 dependency gets resolved (i.e Fabric SDK jar successfully uploaded to maven repository), will change app so that it uses SDK Jar from maven repository and puts in daily test bucket.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've been trying to integrate the Java SDK into a fairly complex enterprise application that uses Java 8 and various enterprise Java technologies.  For some reason I can't quite figure out, when the code in the Java SDK generates self signed client certificates for service discovery in this environment, OpenSSL rejects the private key as being invalid.  If we specify Bouncy Castle as the security provider to use when generating the private key, then the problem goes away. This seems like a sensible fix given that we already do this for the certificate part of the process.  ></description> </Issue>

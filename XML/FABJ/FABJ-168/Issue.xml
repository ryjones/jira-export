CDATA Hi,  I am trying to fetch the complete details of a channel using JAVA SDK. The channel is already created successfully with multiple peers joined already on it. There are a couple of eventHubs added to the channel.  Later, I am trying to fetch the channels on the peer as follows  Set<String> channels = client.queryChannels(peer); And then I get the details of the Channel as follows:  Channel channel = client.newChannel(channelName);   And then I try to get the Peers and Eventhubs as follows:  Collection<EventHub> eventHubs = channel.getEventHubs();  Collection<Peer> peers = channel.getPeers();   However, the eventHubs and peers are always returned empty. Am I missing something here?   Regards  Sajeev  ></description> </Issue>

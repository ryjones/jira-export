CDATA The client does not persist anything of the channel.   See examples  End2endIT  constructs an initial channel, joins peers executes chaincode etc.  End2endAndBackAgainIT recreates from an existing channel to execute chaincode etc.     Directly from the READM.md  Note, the SDK does ***not*** provide a means of persistence   for the application defined channels and user artifacts on the client. This is left for the embedding application to best manage.  ></body> </Action>

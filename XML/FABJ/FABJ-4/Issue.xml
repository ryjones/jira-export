CDATA Throughput testing of the orderer {{Broadcast}} interface using code which generates non-ENDORSER transactions (just messages with an arbitrary payload) shows throughput of ~900-1000 tps on my local laptop with v1.0.0 code.  Using a sample client from  ~jimthematrix , similar results are achieved using the node SDK.  I have heard some reports of tps rates as low as 50-60 when invoking {{Broadcast}} via the java SDK.  I strongly suspect this that is user error or poor network configuration, however, there is no obvious way to refute these claims.  It would be nice, to have a simple java-sdk test client which constructs messages similarly to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11267/ which can be used to test throughput of the {{Broadcast}} API for the Java SDK independent of the rest of the fabric stack.  ></description> </Issue>

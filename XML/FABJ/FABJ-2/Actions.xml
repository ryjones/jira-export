CDATA Note that a client app ( via SDK ) sends a transaction to only one orderer. The orderers will replicate the request among themselves as needed by the consensus algorithm. SDK does not have to participate in this.  The channel configuration  may list multiple orderers but SDK should use them as backup in case the send to orderer1 has a communications problem ( or you can round-robin, transaction 1 to orderer1, transaction 2 to orderer2 and so on )   ></body> </Action>

To be thread safe the client would need to be dedicated to just one Java thread. This is too heavyweight.  By allowing users to set the user context on the requests themselves there is no need to switch at the client level but can fall back to that if not explicitly set on the request." priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-06-06 17:41:54.0" updated="2018-07-19 00:20:25.0" resolutiondate="2017-06-08 16:54:36.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="33553" security="10001"/>

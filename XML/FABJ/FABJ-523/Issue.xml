CDATA Fabric 2.2 added support for TLS 1.3.  Using Wireshark we monitored traffic for both the SDK Go and the SDK Node, both of which were in fact using TLS 1.3 to encrypt communication from the client to the peer. When using the SDK Java however, TLS 1.2 was used client to peer communication.  I'm not sure what changes need to be made to support default TLS 1.3 behavior but we should investigate and get support for TLS 1.3 working.  ></description> </Issue>

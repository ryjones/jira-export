CDATA Currently the connection profile uses the following format for TLS CA Certs: {quote}"tlsCACerts": \{ "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...." }, {quote} We tried providing concatenated root certificates for all our peers/orderers in the pem string. But Java SDK fails to load all of those and uses the first one in the concatenated certificate. Thus, the connection fails to some of the components.  We would like to propose an array of TLS CA Certs in the connection profile which would help load each cert in the Java SDK:    {quote}"tlsCACerts":  \{ "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...." },\{ "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...." },\{ "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...." } , {quote}    This will require a change in Java SDK and as the connection profile will change, it will need a change in Node SDK.     Please note this issue is when the SDK connects to the CA (http) and to the peer/orderer (grpc) as well.  gerrit CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20917/  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Provided fix  so when an eventhub url is provided and a eventhub is created we don't also produce an eventing peer. Should be enough to work with 1.0.x networks. Provided a means to discover which channel names are available to load from the configuation. Fixed issue where failed to verify certficates produce by CA with extra attributies. Pembytes and Pemfiles with multiple certs should be working. Fixed several streams not being closed properly.  ></body> </Action>

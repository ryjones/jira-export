CDATA *As a* client application developer *I want* to use Java 11 *So that* I can take advantage of newer language features and JVM performance  Running with Java 11 fails since certain libraries (such as javax.xml.bind) are used internally by fabric-sdk-java and have been removed from the core Java libraries and packaged as separate modules. Suggest adding such libraries to the fabric-sdk-java module as explicit dependencies so that client application developers using Java 11 can build and run projects successfully with only a dependency on fabric-sdk-java.  ></description> </Issue>

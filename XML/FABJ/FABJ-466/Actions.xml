<Action id="64873" issue="41761" author="heatherp" type="comment" body="Hey Dave, sorry this is a bit of a pain. We&apos;re removing roles in v2.0.0, so it shouldn&apos;t be a problem there. We think this is fixed by using &quot;service&quot; in replace of &quot;serviceDiscovery&quot; - can you give that a go? We&apos;ve got an issue here for updating docs in v1.4.x for that here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FGJ-42" created="2019-10-22 12:48:28.0" updateauthor="heatherp" updated="2019-10-22 12:48:28.0"/>

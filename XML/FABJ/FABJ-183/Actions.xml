CDATA I don't see this as an SDK issue.  I think this should be worked with eclipse foundation.  I know of other eclipse users of the SDK and this issue is the first report of it.   ~gbohra  Can you please close this and work with Eclipse Foundation on resolving this ?  Once identified the issue and you feel there is error or lacking in the Eclipse set up we'd welcome that feedback.  ></body> </Action>

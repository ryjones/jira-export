CDATA Fabric v2.1.0 is due mid-April, potentially earlier. So before Easter let's have done the following list. We're going to release from master, essentially making it like a release-2.x branch, until we're due an LTS branch, at which point we'd fork a master branch again. * -Ensure we're testing against Fabric v2.1 (should be pulling *2.1*, not *2.1.0*)- * -Update any references to v2.0.0 etc- * -Release, usual stuff: release notes, version number change etc- -*Above covered in Pr #49, should probably happen after #48*- * -Release via maven (?) and tag the commit in github- * -Finally: version bump to 2.1.1-snapshots, update readMe section about 2.0.0-snapshots - Pr #50-  ></description> </Issue>

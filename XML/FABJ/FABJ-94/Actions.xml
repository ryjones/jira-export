CDATA  ~rickr  well..I think here using slf4j is better.We can choose log4j logger object or JDK built-in logger. About the env variable,you meaned we can set it in Config.java?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't want to move to slf4j in v 1.0.0 we'll take a look at that for v1.1. org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/helper/Config.java  call the api logging to enable logging as I suggested above.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rickr  i think we should consider switching to slf4j from apache common logging due to its potential classloader problems. the SDK is going to be dropped into an application with any kind of classloading policies and hierarchies and the JCL way of discovering implementations is pretty susceptible to problems. I did a brief research online to see if slf4j is still favored over JCL and it does still seem to be the case.   ~zerppen   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rickr  I don't understand if we need log4j or slf4j for v1.0.0.If it's not necessary for current development,maybe u can assign me a necessary task.To the logging, I have tested log4j2 and slf4j,then choosed slf4j.          ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rickr well..  of course I can do that.But I should make you know that it's not so good,because slf4j or log4j using property file setting log levels,while if we want to enable logging through env variables that just  putting env variables into property file by FileReader. I will push code to gerrit then.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Old version of log4j really can.But since version 2.0.1,it is no longer available. To every class you need log, the old version of log4j uses method setLevel to set logging level. I don't think it's  convenient,because I don't want to change all the code when I need change logging level. So,old version of log4j or both via env variables and property file setting logging levels?  ></body> </Action>

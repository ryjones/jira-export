CDATA If a business contract requires multiple "actions" to succeed or fail atomically (all or none), then the best way to write the application code is by packaging up all the pairs of proposal:proposalResponses, one pair per action, into a single sendTransaction() call. The fabric will guarantee through the transaction processing that all the actions included are processed atomically.  As of v1.0, node and java SDK only support a single "action" per transaction.  Similarly, as of v1.0 peer/ledger only supports a single action per transaction.Â  The associated peer/ledger work item is FAB-445.  ></description> </Issue>

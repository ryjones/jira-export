CDATA I cannot find a standard Java way of generating certification requests. The CryptoPrimitives code the SDK has now uses BouncyCastle. All documentation I've found either uses BouncyCastle or use keytool.  Since this is only used for sdk <-> fabric-ca interactions,  I'm going to force MemberServicesFabricCAImpl to use the sdk specific implementation of the crypto interface. The pluggable Crypto interface will not have a method for genning cert requests. It's up to the implementer to get the signed cert out-of-band, either via calls to fabric-ca or some other CA.  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="27114" issue="18413" author="rickr" type="comment" body="When you download the SDK jar there is no user implementation.  Each application has the freedom to define their own.  What&apos;s important is they implement the User and Enrollment interfaces.  The sample shows how that can be done and applications are of course free to borrow from that code." created="2017-06-21 12:49:12.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2017-06-21 12:49:12.0"/>
<Action id="27117" issue="18413" author="grapebaba" type="comment" body="That&apos;s my point, right now user must implement their own user and enrollment. If the sample implementation is good, make it as a default implementation and publish it. It seems make more sense for me. Maybe many users just copy the sample code in their application. And it not impact who want to implement their own." created="2017-06-21 13:00:13.0" updateauthor="grapebaba" updated="2017-06-21 13:00:13.0"/>
<Action id="27118" issue="18413" author="rickr" type="comment" body="The sample code is of course available with the SDK   In a user&apos;s own application they may not want that.  I know of several user&apos;s of the SDK that already have a User type object that they just add and implement that interface.  They don&apos;t want in the SDK jar the Sample code. Just bloat in their perspective.   This keeps the SDK light weight and offers applications a starting point for their own applications if the choose to use it. " created="2017-06-21 13:09:08.0" updateauthor="rickr" updated="2017-06-21 13:09:46.0"/>

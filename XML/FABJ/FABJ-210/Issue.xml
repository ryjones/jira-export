CDATA The NetworkConfig code doesn't support adding the certificate to the CAInfo object.  The code (at least in 1.1.0-alpha) is commented as a TODO.   Without this it isn't possible to use the CAInfo object to build the connection to an HFCAClient and have it work when the CA server is using TLS.  Unfortunately there's no internal visibility to the JsonObject that is used to create the CAInfo object so one has to parse it externally to pull out the pem and build the properties, either by duplicating the logic in the createAllCertificateAuthorities() method or by mapping a json response outside the NetworkConfig object.  ===  As an aside - and outside the original report - changing the HFCAClient to self-create with some form of loadFromNetworkConfig (in the same vein that the HFClient creates a channel) either by CA name or by doing a random select from the list of CAs available would be a tremendous improvement.          gerrit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20227/     ></description> </Issue>

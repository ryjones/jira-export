CDATA I have been able to successfully run the End2endIT integration test using private keys in the SafeNet Luna Network HSM with the 14471 changes and some additional changes on the tests side of things.  I had to modify End2endIT.java to calculate the SKI from the certificate public key and use that to obtain a LunaPrivateKey using the KeyStore.getKey method using the SKI as the alias.  I changed the getMember method in SampleStore.java to accept a PrivateKey rather than a File.  As well, the private keys for the Admin user for org1 and org2 had to be generated on the HSM.  I accomplished this using the fabric-ca-client gencsr command including the changes in  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14527/  so that the CKA_LABEL of the key is set to the SKI (The SafeNet LunaProvider uses the alias to search for keys by the CKA_LABEL attribute).  I then used openssl to generate the certificates from the CSRs and copied the certificates to all of the necessary locations.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It sounds like the changes you're making are reasonable for an application using the SDK in the Luna environment.  I don't have experience on how widely Luna is used but maybe it's worth consideration documenting this in the SDK in a Luna_Readme.md ?    ></body> </Action>

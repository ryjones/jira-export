CDATA As far as I can see, the Channel#inititlize method forces me to have a peer admin identity. To query a channel or invoke functions, the channel also has to be initialized. So far, I can not see an analogon for this need in the Node.js SDK.  For Node.js, invoking chaincode functions or querying the ledger can be done with a user identity obtained from the CA.   I have not succeed to use the same user identity to query or invoke functions from java sdk. Is there a reason for this difference or am I missing some point?  ></description> </Issue>

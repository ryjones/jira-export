CDATA Initialize the channel with peerAdmin is need as the user can't get the genesis block need. to the MSP.  Also ONLY the peerAdmin can install chaincode on the peers and instantiate them.  Once done member can invoke chaincode.   End2endIt does switch over to CA member created user once that is done.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/2adcdbca9e2e81bd5966386e4e3f012c03c7b976/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdkintegration/End2endIT.java#L457   ></body> </Action>

CDATA But what to do, if i want to join an already created and joined channel with an already installed and instantiated chaincode? There is a method newChannel(String channelName) for an already existing channel.  So, I would assume that everything is setup correctly and the only thing my application has to do is invoking chaincode functions.  Isn't this a reasonable use case?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't see that issue .. ran the sample I attached on v1.0.1 java sdk level  starting at line 201 after both organizations have created the channel and instantiated chaincode    It start again now setting up running as a regular user  ></body> </Action>

I'll try to reproduce this in my setting but this is how I would expect it to work. Maybe I got some of my settings wrong.     Thanks=)  ></body> </Action>

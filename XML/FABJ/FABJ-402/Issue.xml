CDATA There is instance where the fabric-java-sdk logs {code:java} Sending proposal to peer01xxxx.xxx.clsnet failed because of: gRPC failure=Status{code=UNKNOWN, description=Error executing chaincode: Transaction returned with failure: premature execution - chaincode (public:1.0.1.1) launched and waiting for registration, cause=null}{code} Since this is logged with a log level ERROR by fabric-java-sdk this is captured by our monitoring utility and thus creating a alert for support group. We are checking how this can be fixed.  This topic was discussed on Rocket Chat some time back and getting a Premature Execution is an expected behavior from Fabric PEER v1.0.x. This happens when PEER receives multiple chaincode container invoke request from HFC at around the same time.  Our first thought indicates PEER does not send the response code and hence fabric-java-sdk gets an execution exception (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/v1.0.1/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/Channel.java#L2241)  Can you please check and reassign the component if this is not a fabric-peer issue.  ></description> </Issue>

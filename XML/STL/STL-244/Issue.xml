CDATA Here's a line of output from a failed test: integration_test_1  | FAIL Can you tellÂ what test failed? No, but it would be nice to be to be able to. Figure out how to get the container names to match the test. Doing this might even lead to the removal of the annoying `-s` flags from `run_docker_test`, making local testing easier and greatly cleaning up `run_tests`.  ></description> </Issue>

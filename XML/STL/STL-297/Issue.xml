Permissioning rules could determine the roles an identity is able to play on the network (e.g. connect, peer, publish blocks, forward blocks/batches). Message handlers should examine incoming messages against the permissioning rules and the current configuration and either permit, drop, or respond with an error to the sending node. In certain cases (e.g. attempting to peer without permission), it may make sense to forcibly close the connection." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-05-22 14:58:21.0" updated="2017-07-10 19:25:51.0" resolutiondate="2017-07-06 16:26:36.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="16993"/>

CDATA When a websocket connection is opened, then subsequently closed, the REST API becomes unresponsive to subsequent HTTP state GETs.  When turning up the logging, it is apparent that the REST API has sent a protobuf request to the validator, but is stalled on receiving a response.  Â   The attached logs of REST API + Validator show this sequence:  GET some state (Successful)  open a websocket (Successful until...)  close websocket  Then GET state on the REST API (sends the request to validator, stalls on response)  ></description> </Issue>

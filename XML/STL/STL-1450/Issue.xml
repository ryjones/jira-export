CDATA Validator transaction executor wait invariably to post batches.  Steps to recreate bug.  1. Started services validator, settings-tp, intkey-tp and sawtooth-rest-api. 2. Modified the transaction family name from “intkey” to “abcdef”. 3. Posted batches  4. Response took approx. 5 min and posted batch in pending state. 5. Changed family name back to “intkey”.  6. Posted batch with transaction family name as “intkey”.  7. Further posted batches for intkey TP, remain in pending status. 8. “abcdef” transaction processor wait invariably. Intkey TP to post batches is not allowed.  Configured the validator for parallel transaction execution. Validator Transaction executor should handle any miss behavior from transaction processor (Traffic generator/ Intkey).     ></description> </Issue>

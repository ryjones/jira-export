CDATA A running validator can be killed very easily by sending a message that has more than two parts. The easiest way to do this is to connect to the validator with a REQ socket and send a message. I tested this on a validator that is under intkey load and it stopped processing as soon as it got the message. See Adam Ludvik for more details.  ></description> </Issue>

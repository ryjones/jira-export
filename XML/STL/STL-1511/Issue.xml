<Issue id="39110" key="STL-1511" number="1511" project="10001" reporter="achenette" assignee="mfford" creator="achenette" type="10004" summary="A doc page-not-found error jumps out of docs into Sawtooth website" priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-04-05 16:21:50.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:33:40.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="51985"> <environment><! CDATA To see an example of the problem, go to the Sawtooth SDK API Reference landing page:  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sdks.html   Then click on one of the Go SDK links:   Transaction Processor|https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/go_sdk/processor.html#http://    Signing|https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/go_sdk/signing.html#http://   ></environment> <description><! CDATA If a doc file or link isn't found, the user sees a 404 page for the Sawtooth website, not the documentation. The only offered link is to the Sawtooth home page (plus the standard website nav at the top). This takes the user out of the docs and into the website.  Instead, the user should see a doc-specific "page not found" message that includes links to the top-level doc contents, a doc search, and "return to previous page" link, if possible.        ></description> </Issue>

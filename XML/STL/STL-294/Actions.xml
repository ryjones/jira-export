CDATA config file conflicts if /etc/default/sawtooth* files are edited  does not restart services  will not install new packages or remove old/expired ones, so if changes are made to the metapackage, it will not upgrade (this is default apt behavior)  need to add version pinning to metapackage because behavior now for older packages is to install current version of dependencies. May also want to consider removing or republishing the previous metapackages due to this behavior.  ></body> </Action>

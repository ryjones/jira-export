CDATA The `sawtooth-validator` must be restarted if a consensus engine is restarted.  If I restart devmode-engine-rust, say: `sudo -u sawtooth devmode-engine-rust -vv --connect tcp://localhost:5050 ` The `sawtooth-validator` never reconnects to the new devmode-engine-rust process.  The workaround is to restart `sawtooth-validator` after restarting `devmode-engine-rust`  Note that vice-versa works--I can restart the validator and I do not need to restart the consensus engine.  This occurs on Sawtooth 1.0. It probably also occurs on Sawtooth 1.1.  Filing this as a bug per a recommendation in the FAQ code review:  {{generator/source/faq/consensus.rst How do I restart a consensus engine? ------------------------------------ First stop the validator, then restart the consensus engine. If you leave the validator engine running, it will not connect to the restarted consensus engine. @vaporos vaporos 2 hours ago  Member This should be considered a bug. Maybe we could link to a JIRA here.}} ( see https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-website/pull/27 )  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~sukrit007 , I tried to reproduce it on the current as well as v1.0.1 version. But I did not get any exception as such. I tried running Java as well as CPP TPs but both of them went on smoothly. I verified their being on track after a validator restart by carrying out some normal transactions.   Can you please chip in further inputs so that I can reproduce the issue?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rranjan3  in your test run: * How long was validator down before you started it ?  In my case,  I waited for 10s before starting back the validator docker container. * Also, did you restart transaction processor or both TP as well as validator ? In my case I stopped and started the validator , but not TP. * Would you be able to attach your example and I can run it locally ?   I am able to consistently reproduce the issue and wondering if I am doing something different.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~rranjan3  I think I found the issue.  I was connecting to port mapped on the host.  So in the simplewallet example,  if you modify build_java_processor.sh to connect to tcp://host-ip:4040  or tcp://docker.for.mac.host.internal:4040,   you will be able to reproduce the issue.     Thanks for sharing the example.  We will modify our app, for now, to use the same network instead of using mapped port.       ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks for your research  ~sukrit007 .     This appears to be more of a configuration issue rather than a bug in the application. The validator listens on port 4004 and things are fine when configured for it. There can be issues otherwise as in this case.     ></body> </Action>

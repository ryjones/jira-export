CDATA Research the changes needed to automatically reduce the size of a compiled WASM file.  The Sabre doc "Compiling the Contract" recommends using a script to reduce the size of a compiled WASM file:  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/nightly/master/application_developer_guide.html#compiling-the-contract   The doc has a link to a web page that which references the wasm-gc script:  https://www.hellorust.com/news/native-wasm-target.html   However, the wasm-gc repo has information about recent changes that make the script unnecessary:  https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc  .  The best way to reduce the size of the wasm binaries should be researched and added to the documentation  ></description> </Issue>

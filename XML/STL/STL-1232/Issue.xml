CDATA PoET objects (block publisher, fork resolver, and block verifier) start up with a block cache, a batch publisher, and a state view factory. In the consensus engine, these objects will have to be substituted with proxies, which will return the necessary information using consensus service calls (except for the batch publisher, which will communicate using a client endpoint).     Note that implementing the block cache proxy entails implementing a block store proxy as well, since that is exposed as a block cache interface. The proxy state view factory should produce proxy state views.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Requested by TASE.  When a transaction is being rejected as invalid, querying on transaction status should show rejected reason.  Invalid transaction status could be queried by rest api for several minutes after it is rejected and client needs to know the rejected reason in order to decide on next action (re-submit same transaction payload perhaps or maybe transaction or transaction payload weren't formatted correctly).  Checking the TP/validator logs is not an appropriate solution for product, it is very hard to be done automatically and client that submits transactions might not have access to logs.  If transaction is rejected by TP, the exception message from TP can be displayed as rejected reason.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

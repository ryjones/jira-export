CDATA In the Change Control section, the following requirements/suggestions are unmet:  "The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a human-readable summary of major changes in that release to help users determine if they should upgrade and what the upgrade impact will be. The release notes MUST NOT be the raw output of a version control log (e.g., the "git log" command results are not release notes). Projects whose results are not intended for reuse in multiple locations (such as the software for a single website or service) AND employ continuous delivery MAY select "N/A". (URL required)"  "The release notes MUST identify every publicly known vulnerability that is fixed in each new release. This is "N/A" if there are no release notes or there have been no publicly known vulnerabilities"  https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/954#changecontrol  ></description> </Issue>

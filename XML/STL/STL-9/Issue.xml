CDATA Issue: When you alter an arcade transaction after it's signature has been added, it passes is_valid in SignedObject. Later transactions may fail because the OriginatorId isn't correct.   Suggestion: Perhaps, a greater permissioning scheme could be added to arcade, like mktplace has where a creator-id needs to both match a valid creator in the store, and the txn.OriginatorId.     ></description> </Issue>

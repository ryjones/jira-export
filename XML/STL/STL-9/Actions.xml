CDATA In reference to STL-11 which is related to this item and STL-10: What we ended up going with is adding self.public_key to SignedObject. When verify signature is called it checks the expected public_key against the the originator_public_key that is generated from the serialized object and the signature. If they differ, the signed_object (transaction) has been modified and is not valid. This fixes all transaction families since SignedObject is the superclass to all transactions.     ></body> </Action>

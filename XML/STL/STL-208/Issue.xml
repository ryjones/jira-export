CDATA Aiohttp's _run_app_ method handles a good deal of complexity in starting up a web server, but it also includes a hardcoded _print_ call which does not match the style of logs being used elsewhere in Sawtooth. Additionally, there may be other aspects of the start up process that could be customized to better suit our needs.  Evaluate what start up process would best suit Sawtooth's REST API, implement a solution, and replace _aiohttp.web.run_app_ with that solution.  ></description> </Issue>

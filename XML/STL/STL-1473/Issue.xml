CDATA We recently upgraded our custom TP but forgot to archive the older version of TP. When we tried to add a new node to the existing network, we found that it would never catch up the network because it cannot validate the older version transactiosns..  So, how to solve this issue if we are not able to find the older version of TP?  Are there any best practices for TP version management?  I considered to use one handler for each version, but it is not very good for code reuse.  ></description> </Issue>

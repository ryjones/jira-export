CDATA Currently, only the validator to validator connections send heartbeats to keep the connection alive. This should be expanded to include all zmq connections (to TPs, REST API, State Delta exports etc..) to keep these connections alive.   This can be done by removing the option to turn heartbeats on in interconnect and just alwasy sending the ping messages. This requires validating that the rest api's, tp, and state delta exports simply ignore these messages.  ></description> </Issue>

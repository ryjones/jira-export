CDATA In the design please consider how this code will run on a machine that does not support SGX. We included a separate code path in PoET1 for an enclave simulator.   I would prefer that this time we use a single code path and use the SGX SDK's simulator option to build the enclave.  Also a learning from poet1 to carry into poet2, is the naming convention for the enclave/protocol. Rather than refering to poet as simulator and sgx we should refer to the options as cft and bft for simulated enclave and actual enclave respectively.  ></body> </Action>

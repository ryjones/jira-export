CDATA The tutorial as it currently exists covers the creation of a transaction processor, for which we have a full implementation to serve as an example.  Instead of ending as it does currently, the tutorial should continue by showing some client examples as well, including game play using the xo CLI.  This could potentially change the tutorial from a transaction processor tutorial to a more comprehensive application development tutorial covering transaction processor and client-side transaction submission and state viewing.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Consider removing the 'sawtooth cluster' command, given that it is not currently heavily used but requires significant effort to maintain.  This command can be replaced by using docker compose, which seems more flexible (at the expense of being docker-specific instead of sawtooth-specific).  Please place support for 'sawtooth cluster' in the comments if you do not want this feature to be removed in 0.8.  ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="17067" key="STL-314" number="314" project="10001" reporter="cintel" creator="cintel" type="10002" summary="Add support for domain specific data to the Supply chain records and agents" priority="3" status="10404" created="2017-05-24 19:39:21.0" updated="2021-03-15 18:51:36.0" votes="1" watches="4" workflowId="17071"> <description><! CDATA The supply chain TP should be able to accept an arbitrary set of fields for both agents and records. Both the Agent and Record proto definitions need to be expanded to include a domain_data(better name?_ array that will consist of a list of fields that are (name, value) tuples. The name and values will both be strings and the value is expected to be able to support stored encoded data.      These should be able to be set on initial record creation. There should be a mechanism in place(new txn type) for these fields to be updated by the current owner of the  Record or the Agent themselves for Agent records.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The pending queue limit is improperly calculated in the {{BlockPublisher._rebuild_pending_batches}} method.  This is using the list of committed batches which include batches across whole forks, not just a single block.    Correct this to only update the rolling average based on a block's batch count  ></description> </Issue>

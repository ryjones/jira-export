CDATA Seth currently builds against Kenneth Koski's private fork of Burrow for its EVM, not the Hyperledger mainline.  Whilst done for fine reasons in the past this is a serious hygiene issue. Â Especially with security reviews and other quality processes only looking at the main Hyperledger code bases we need to make sure everything is consistent and under the control of the community.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I've encountered situation when transactions are processed only in pairs, i.e. first transaction is not submitted until the second one is pushed to REST API. What could be an issue? Thanks in advance. Update. This was caused by adding new validator to blockchain. We passed a list of existing peers to this validator on start, but all existing validators still did notÂ  have new one in their peer list. Documentation stated that peering is bidirectional, but seems that it does not work this way. After deleting this extra node everything started working.  ></description> </Issue>

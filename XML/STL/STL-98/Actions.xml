CDATA My thinking is that we should not write Python 2.7 documentation, at least not in this case. The idea behind the documentation here is to provide examples to clarify the underlying concepts, not to document the prescribed way to do it in every possible language (and language version).Â   In other words, if Python 2.7 is your jam, I'd recommend reading the Python 3 tutorial to learn what is needed, and then use your favorite libraries.  ></body> </Action>

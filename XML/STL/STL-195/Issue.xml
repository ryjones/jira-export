CDATA The Environment Setup section describes how to startup a sawtooth environment easily with Docker.  This is probably the easiest/best option for most application developers.  The "Getting Started with Hyperledger Sawtooth" section describes things in a way that would be more appropriate for native Ubuntu installs or vagrant.  For example, when using Docker, you do not manually startup the validator or worry about genesis block creation as it is done for you in the docker compose file.  Some of this content should be rewritten and generalized.  Other portions of the content should move into the Ubuntu install section of the Environment Setup guide.  (Similar to how we show docker compose up/down, we could show basic operations when installing via deb packages.)  ></description> </Issue>

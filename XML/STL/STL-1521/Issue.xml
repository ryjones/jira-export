CDATA RFC text/0000-raw-txn-header.md describes in brief the need to have serialized transaction header sent to transaction processor. # Introduce required proto changes, set EXPANDED as default. # Introduce a way for application developer to choose header style before registering transactiion processor with validator. # Either raw header bytes or de-serialized transaction header is sent in TpProcessRequest, not both. # Validator to clue SDK engine about its version by sending back request_header_style in TpRegisterResponse. # MAX_SDK_PROTOCOL_VERSION is the maximum version that the validator can support. The SDK shall consider registration attempt unsuccessful if validator cannot support a feature.

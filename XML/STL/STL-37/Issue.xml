CDATA If a transaction processor crashes without sending a friendly disconnect message to the validator, the executor will never detect it is gone.  This essentially hangs the validator.  This can be replicated by modifying one of the go examples and referencing a field in a struct when it's nil (this causes a runtime error similar to segfault).  Another approach might be to kill -9 a running TP.  Starting the transaction processor back up will register, but submitted transactions will not be processed.  ></description> </Issue>

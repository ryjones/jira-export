CDATA *Primary Defect* is that is_valid() should no longer be overridden by Transaction subclasses. is_valid() and instructions to create it should be removed from the code and tutorial docs. check_valid() should be updated to call its parent method rather than super(…).is_valid().   *Related Defects (listed together as these items should be part of the same commit)* #2 the ctrl-c may no longer be needed here: Inside the vagrant environment (login with “vagrant ssh”), start a txnvalidator as follows, and after a few seconds, kill it by pressing CTRL-C: … as the validator should exit if it can’t find the transaction family.  #3 string method does not write action and should only conditionally write the space if it exists (which should only be the case for a “take” action).  #4 Update txnvalidator.js to remove unsupported log settings.  #5 Make sure all documentation is updated accordingly based on these fixes. Make sure all documentation is updated accordingly based on these fixes.      ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="16273" key="STL-58" number="58" project="10001" reporter="mfford" assignee="agunde" creator="mfford" type="10006" summary="Implement direct send of messages from peer to peer by opening a temporary connection" description="In order to reduce message volume on the network, it is advantageous to perform direct delivery of messages between peers in certain cases. For example, if a node broadcasts a REQUEST message for a missing Block, it is preferable for the reply to be sent from the replying node directly to the requesting node, rather than being broadcast across the network. Define a mechanism for a temporary direct connection to a remote node for delivery of a message or a set of messages which does not require a peering relationship to be established. Initially this should support network endpoints as specified by a ZMQ style URI string (e.g. tcp://192.168.0.55:8800). Future enhancements may include peer addressing by other information stored in the network topology. For now, let’s assume that the pattern is REQUEST/reply where the REQUEST message will contain the requesting peer’s endpoint. The network component should attempt to open a direct connection to the peer, perform whatever session authentication is required, deliver the message, wait for acknowledgement, and close the session/connection." priority="3" status="10404" created="2017-05-03 19:13:58.0" updated="2021-03-01 20:07:10.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="16273"/>

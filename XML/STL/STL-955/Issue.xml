The expected behavior is that these are all the same. Investigate the source of the discrepancy and verify that the execution of transactions is not resulting in a large number of duplicate/retried messages." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-12-14 17:05:11.0" updated="2018-01-31 15:40:45.0" resolutiondate="2018-01-31 15:40:45.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="25748"/>

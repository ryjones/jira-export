CDATA The term 'config' is overloaded, in that we have used it for two purposes: 1) off-chain file-based configuration; and 2) on-chain configuration.  To assist with this, we could rename the config transaction family to 'settings'.  In usual conversation, 'config' would refer to file-based configuration and 'settings' to on-chain settings.  This should be discussed and approved by the maintainers prior to implementation.  ></description> </Issue>

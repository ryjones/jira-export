CDATA A set of LOG instructions are defined by the EVM which can be used to place information into a separate “substate”. It is intended that these logs be stored in a manner that is easily indexed and searched. Smart contract languages have adopted the convention of using these LOG instructions to set up event pub/sub patterns.  The LOG opcodes in the burrow-evm rely on an event-handling system that is part of the burrow project. This will likely need to be preserved in order to use the EVM as it exists in the burrow project. This event handling should be preserved if possible and used to forward events to the Sawtooth event system.  ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="26345" key="STL-966" number="966" project="10001" reporter="micbowman" assignee="jjason" creator="micbowman" type="10005" summary="reduce use of SGX monotonic counters" description="The current code reads and increments the monotonic counter every time a wait timer is created. This is overkill and can potentially lead to NVM wear out in the ME. The monotonic counter is required for protection over reboots, but an in-memory counter (that uses the monotonic counter as an epoch) should be sufficient." priority="3" status="10100" created="2018-01-03 17:23:52.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:34:06.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="26355"/>

CDATA It turns out that the problem is the line numbers.  The Sphinx theme has a bug with the line height for line numbers - it's different than the line height of the included content.  More info here:    https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/417   The simple fix is to turn off the line numbers (remove :linenos: ). There is, in theory, a fancier fix that involves editing a CSS file to carefully fine-tune the line height.  However, I would prefer to remove the line numbers because this is the only place they're used - the other code examples don't show line numbers.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA It looks like the correct fix is to install {{sphinx_rtd_theme}} version 0.2.5b2 and make sure that this theme does not override any of the desired settings in the current Sawtooth documentation.  I don't know enough about sphinx themes & Python to do this. I shall unadopt this issue and put it back under "Help Wanted".  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Closing as Done, because this problem no longer occurs.  It appears that the line-height problem corrected in a bugfix to _sphinx_rtd_theme_:  https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/417  .  I verified the fix by checking the two instances of numbered code blocks in the Sawtooth documentation:   https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html#transaction-data-structure     https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html#batch-data-structure       ></body> </Action>

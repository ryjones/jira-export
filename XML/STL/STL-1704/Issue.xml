CDATA The /peers call does not return reliable information The purpose of the /peers call is to fetche the endpoints of the authorized peers of the validator * Sometimes the /peers call shows multiple connections to the same node - this shows it doesn't merge unique peerings * Sometimes it shows connection to a node that is actually down as well - this shows it doesn't clean up stale peerings  ></description> </Issue>

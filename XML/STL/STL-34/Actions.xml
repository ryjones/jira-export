CDATA Doesn't look like the XO CLI actually does anything with the {{--wait}} flag other than parsing it. The simplest implementation of this would just be to add {{'?wait'}} to the end of the URL the batch is submitted to. However, if forced to wait too long, this will eventually be timed out by the REST API.  The Sawtooth CLI is a little more sophisticated. You can specify a timeout (i.e. {{--wait 30}}), but if you don't, it will wait _indefinitely_. It does this by first submitting the batch without waiting, and then repeatedly querying for batch status (which also can be waited for), resending the query every time it times out. You can find this implementation in {{cli/sawtooth_cli/submit.py}} lines 60-81.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This Epic will be in two phases:  1. Produce a design document covering batch submission permissioning using signing keys (also called signature-based permissioning). This design will cover both network-wide signing key permissioning (using on-chain settings) as well as per-validator signing key permissioning (using file-based configuration).  2, Implement, document, and provide tests for Signing Key Permissioning per the design.   This epic covers batch submission permissioning using signing keys (also called signature-based permissioning).  Two primary methods of defining allowed signing keys are covered:  - On-chain configuration (STL-276) - File-based configuration (STL-274)  This epic is complete when both approaches have been implemented with associated documentation and testing.  ></description> </Issue>

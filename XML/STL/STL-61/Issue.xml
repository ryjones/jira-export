CDATA We do not currently have a transaction family specification for xo in our docs.  Since we use xo as our example transaction family for tutorial purposes, it would make sense to also provide a transaction family specification.  Following the format of the Sawtooth Config or Validator Registry transaction families, write a transaction family spec for the XO Family.  ></description> </Issue>

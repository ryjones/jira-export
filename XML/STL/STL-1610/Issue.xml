<Issue id="40447" key="STL-1610" number="1610" project="10001" reporter="atlowell" creator="atlowell" type="10005" summary="Change Default Key of sawset CLI, or make &quot;--key&quot; Mandatory" priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-06-06 16:04:48.0" updated="2019-10-16 21:05:35.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="53364"> <description><! CDATA If no "–key" argument is specified for the "sawset genesis" CLI command (and other sawset commands as well), the userkey is used.  While this is good practice for other CLI commands, users may want sawset to use the validator keypair instead.  The system administrator and developer guides recommend different strategies.  This can lead to confusing behavior for a user.  In testing, failing to specifiy a validator key (thus causing the user key to be the default) has led to issues, and this may be a cause of STL-1535.  Further testing will be needed to prove this link.  Proposed solution is to either change the default signer key for sawset genesis (and perhaps other commands) to the validator key, or make the "key" CLI argument mandatory.  ></description> </Issue>

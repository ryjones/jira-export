CDATA *Description*  The validator would not process more transactions after he receives a transaction with an unknown family_name.  *Impact*  This behavior is problematic because it has the effect of freezing a validator. Nevertheless, when the `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families` is used everything is good   *Reproducibility*  This is reproducible no matter what validator is used (python 1.0.4 or python+rust latest master) and no matter what consensus is used devmode/software_poet/devmode_rust  To reproduce it, deploy a network with a given transaction family, run a few transactions, verify they are good, change the name of the family_name, send some transactions with the modified family_name, change back the family_name to its correct version, the transactions stay in the `PENDING` state (according to the REST api).     ></description> </Issue>

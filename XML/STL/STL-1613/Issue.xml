CDATA When running the build of Seth vs master, which has no new changes since the last successful build - we receive the following rust compilation error       {noformat} error: failed to run custom build command for `openssl v0.9.24` process didn't exit successfully: `/project/sawtooth-seth/cli/target/debug/build/openssl-7d464e70a21ffa53/build-script-build` (exit code: 101) --- stderr thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to detect OpenSSL version', /root/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/openssl-0.9.24/build.rs:16:14 note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.  warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish... error: build failed Service 'seth-cli' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c cargo build && cp ./target/debug/seth /project/sawtooth-seth/bin/seth' returned a non-zero code: 101{noformat} The base image is pulling in  openssl-amd64-1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.1 which is incompatible with cargo's openssl v0.9.24.    For what it's worth it looks to me as if that is getting selected because of reqwest 0.8.8 which is subject to this issue (see  https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/336)    Since nothing has changed in the source, I can only presume this break sources either from the openssl getting updated in the base version, or from upstream in the sawtooth-rust-sdk or other.        ></description> </Issue>

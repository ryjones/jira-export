CDATA Implement State Pruning in the Merkle-Radix Tree Database.  This will limit the growth of the state database by removing old entries, and limiting growth to a recent number of state roots.  Growth will be a factor of number of addresses in state, not based around the number of blocks overall.  This work may require migration utilities.   ></description> </Issue>

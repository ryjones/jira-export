CDATA Implement a tool which will replay the blocks contained in a block store through the scheduler/executor/context manager/TPs.  Initially, this tool is primarily for testing scheduler implementations and debugging.  This tool should make aggressive use of the schedulers, by default, spanning multiple blocks across a single scheduler.  It should also have options to make it behave closer to the journal (currently single block at a time).  This tools should print performance statistics as it operates.  ></description> </Issue>

I got this working on Internet (not behind a proxy) by using: * Seth changeset 52a051 from 2018 (prior to ST 1.1 & Bionic changes) * Sawtooth 1.0 Docker images  Then I changed Docker containers from ST 1.0 to 1.1 images (specifically 1.1.4) and it did not work. That is the validator panics as above.  So the validator regression or incompatibility was introduced prior to the Sawtooth 1.1.4 release.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA MarLu96 1:54 AM    Hi all, I'm trying to create a node that can deploy solidity contract with seth, but using PoET (and not devMode). Here is how I modify the docker-compose file from the seth github. It seems that when I create an account ` seth account create --nonce=0 --wait myalias ` , nothing happens like if the connection is not properly done. I have the returned message ` Error: Problem submitting account creation transaction: Transaction was submitted, but client timed out before it was committed. `  danintel 8:47 AM @MarLu96 The problem is you are using the latest version of Seth, which is broken--it does not work. The workaround is to roll back Seth to changeset 52a0512 (Disable clippy warning about not returning Self). This forces Seth to run docker-compose with Ubuntu 16 (Xenial) and Sawtooth 1.0. The issue I filed is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1509  ltseeley 9:37 AM @danintel @MarLu96 @rajatwasan @lin2xing the issue with seth account creation has been resolved on the master branch of sawtooth-core: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/2064  ></body> </Action>

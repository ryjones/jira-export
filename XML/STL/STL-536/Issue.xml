CDATA Various commands for 0.8 were added with the assumption that we would at some point rename them for consistency across the project. Now seems an appropriate time to pick the final names and do the renaming.  Commands will use a '-' separator instead of '_', since this is more consistent with Linux commands in general.  The clients commands remain largely unchanged, with intkey_jvm being renamed to jvmsc (since it is an example of JVM smart contracts).  The client commands: sawtooth poet intkey jvmsc xo noop  The validator components will be prefixed with 'sawtooth-':  sawtooth-validator sawtooth-rest-api  Transaction processors will be renamed to conform to the general format of <family>-tp -<lang> . This organization is intended to sort the CLI commands by family instead of function. The commands become:  intkey-tp-go intkey-tp-java intkey-tp-javascript intkey-tp-python jvmsc-tp xo-tp-go xo-tp-javascript xo-tp-python noop-tp-go supplychain-tp poet-validator-registry-tp  ></description> </Issue>

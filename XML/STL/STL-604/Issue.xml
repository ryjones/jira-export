If a set happens after a delete, the delete flag should be unset again. In squash and create_context, if the last thing that happened to an address is a delete, that address should be deleted from the MerkleDatabase. Appropriate methods on the context manager and _StateContext are needed." priority="2" status="10404" created="2017-07-11 17:32:12.0" updated="2021-05-24 20:19:06.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19174"/>

CDATA  ~ryanbeck  is there some reason that this package would need to be separately updgraded?   ~askmish  do you know if this was reproducible on more than one machine? For example is it possible that the initial upgrade did not fully succeed?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, I have tested on 3 different machines and am consistently facing this issue. It seems that during {{apt-get install sawtooth}}, it doesn't upgrade {{python3-cryptography}} package.  Please note, that I have tested with {{sudo apt-get upgrade -y sawtooth}} instead of the {{apt-get install}} and somehow everything works as expected, i.e. {{python3-cryptography}} package gets upgraded as well.  ></body> </Action>

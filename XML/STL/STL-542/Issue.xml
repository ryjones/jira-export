CDATA The Burrow-EVM client only checks that transactions were accepted by the REST API. It does not check to see if the transaction was committed or what the error was. An argument should be added to client methods which, if set, will cause the client to block until: 1. A timeout has been reached, at which point it should return and error 2. The transaction has been committed, at which point it should return normally 3. There was a problem committing the transaction, at which point it should return a useful error  Update the integration tests to use this feature once implemented.  ></description> </Issue>

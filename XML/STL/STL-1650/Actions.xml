CDATA Unlike Sawtooth 1.1 , this error message is logged in Sawtooth 1.2 .  The root cause is the stale volume data/keys that gets created dynamically by the docker-engine on start, which doesn't clear on normal shutting of the network.  Hence, the docker volumes needs to be either cleared or destroyed on shutting the docker network using command " docker-compose down -v" .     ></body> </Action>

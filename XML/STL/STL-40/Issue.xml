CDATA Currently, when a transaction processor (TP) registers, it is added immediately to the collection of processors before the the acknowledgement message is sent back to the TP.    This can result in situations where the TP receives transaction process requests before it receives the registration response.  It requires more complexity on the part of the SDK to manage message ordering.  The validator should send the acknowledgement before allowing the TP to be used during transaction execution.   ></description> </Issue>

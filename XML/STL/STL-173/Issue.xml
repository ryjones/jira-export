CDATA  https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/954   “It is SUGGESTED that the  Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format|http://semver.org/  be used for releases.”   http://semver.org/|https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/954   “Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This API could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation. However it is done, it should be precise and comprehensive”   <Tom> I see a "version" field in openapi.yaml with X.Y.Z formatting, but I don't see the info field ever referenced in any of the REST responses.  I see familiy_version in TransactionHeader, but it doesnt conform to X.Y.Z format. Perhaps the version info is embedded in every response by default?)  “A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers”  <Tom> Some projects claiming conformance have a leading “v” on the X digit, others don’t.  Our project has a leading “v” which doesn’t conform to the spec.)     ></description> </Issue>

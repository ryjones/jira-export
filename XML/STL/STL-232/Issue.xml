CDATA Currently, the "Testing a Transaction Processor" section documents use of TransactionProcessorTestCase from the perspective of writing code. However, we do not provide instructions for the user on how to setup the environment to do this.  We need specific steps in the app dev guide on how to setup and run one of these tests.  This is similar to STL-231, except when the user has followed the Ubuntu deb install path instead of using docker compose.  ></description> </Issue>

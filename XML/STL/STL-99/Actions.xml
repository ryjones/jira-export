CDATA  ~ibansalankit  sorry for the super late response. Feel free to assign anything like this that is unassigned to yourself.

CDATA Verified during sprint planning that this code was rewritten. This issue is no longer valid.  As mentioned above, though, feel free to self-assign any unassigned story if you would like to fix the issue.  ></body> </Action>

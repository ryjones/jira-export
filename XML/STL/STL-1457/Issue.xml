Currently, these settings are only read when a Raft node starts up and initially loads/sets its configuration. This change would entail monitoring the on-chain settings for changes." priority="3" status="10100" created="2018-09-21 16:28:13.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:33:41.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="45304"/>

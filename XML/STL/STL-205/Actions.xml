CDATA In preparation for a Sawtooth community transition from JIRA to Github issues, we are reviewing all issues within JIRA. This issue appears to be inconsistent with the architectural principles of both v1.2, v1.3, and the main branch, and so we are updating this status to won't fix. If you believe this is in error, please help our migration efforts and re-open this issue in Github Issues at https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues.     The networking layer will be replaced in future versions of sawtooth, making this irrelevant.      ></body> </Action>

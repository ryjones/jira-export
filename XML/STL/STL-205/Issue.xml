CDATA zmq_poll() is used to poll the socket connected to the validator and the socket connected to the worker threads for incoming messages. For each socket, if it has messages waiting to be received, only one message is received and routed. It may be better to handle more than one message from each socket that has messages waiting in between polls instead.  ></description> </Issue>

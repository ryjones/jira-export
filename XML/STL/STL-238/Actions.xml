CDATA I could do it, as far as I understand from a discussion in the chat with  ~pschwarz , the steps should be: # `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core.git` # `cd sawtooth-core` # `bin/build_all -l go` # Then copy the sawtooth_sdk folder to the src go folder of your project  Is it fine or is there a better way? If not would it be better to improve first the sdk so the import is not so manual (for instance a simple `go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go` allows to import the fabric sdk)?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA --public-uri was originally required because --network-endpoint defaulted to tcp://*:8800 and so a validator would bind to all endpoints by default. The only sensible --public-uri default is tcp://localhost:8800, but this would cause confusion since both of those defaults in combination would break peering.  The --network-endpoint default has been changed to tcp://127.0.0.1:8800 for security reasons (bandit linting). Letting --public-uri default to tcp://127.0.0.1:8800 now makes sense, so long as it becomes a required setting if --network-endpoint is provided.  ></description> </Issue>

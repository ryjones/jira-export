CDATA sawtooth 1.1  for example: run intkey set twice with same key.  ></environment> <description><! CDATA happens with sawtooth 1.1.x, with sawtooth 1.0 this does not reproduce.  After transaction processor rejects a transaction the validator gets into a loop of keep forwarding this transaction to the transaction processor. loop will end once a new valid transaction arrives.  expected behavior: after transaction is rejected it is marked as rejected and shouldn't be processed again by transaction processor.  ></description> </Issue>

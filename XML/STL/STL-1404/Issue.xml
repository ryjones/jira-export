CDATA If the transaction processor crashes during execution, the executor will resolve the future with an internal error. The transaction is then resubmitted automatically like all internal errors but since there is no matching transaction processor for the transaction, the transaction is never processed and can lock up the scheduler.  This can be reproduced by adding a syntax error into the python intkey tp and submitted a transaction against a validator running a serial scheduler. Once the tp dies, fix the issues and relaunch the tp. Submit a new transaction and you will see it hang.     Either more options for types of Internal Errors should be added or proper waiting for a matching tp to be present should be verified.  ></description> </Issue>

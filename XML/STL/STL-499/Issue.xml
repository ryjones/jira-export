CDATA If a txn has explicit dependencies, it should first look to see if that txn is before it* in the scheduler, and then only if it is use that explicitly dependent txn as a gate on it being next transaction.  Because 'intkey workload' uses dependencies, the parallel scheduler won't work with intkey workload until this is done.  * We are relying on the completer to never allow the dependency to be after that batch with the transaction that lists the dependency.  ></description> </Issue>

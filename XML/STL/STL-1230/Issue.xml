CDATA Add unit test code coverage reporting for Rust components.  Reporting should be equivalent to that currently available for Python, e.g built into the build process.  One possible approach that appears to have traction in the Rust community is kcov.   The project is located here:   https://simonkagstrom.github.io/kcov/   There is a recent tutorial here:  http://sunjay.ca/2016/07/25/rust-code-coverage   ...and an earlier tutorial here:  https://users.rust-lang.org/t/tutorial-how-to-collect-test-coverages-for-rust-project/650   If this has significant impact on build time, then it should be implemented as a build-time switch and executed on nightly build, so that current metrics are available while not impacting PR builds.  ></description> </Issue>

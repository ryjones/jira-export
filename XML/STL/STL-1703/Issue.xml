Attached are the yaml files and validator logs after restarting it. It seems that the validator has received the blocks but is keeping them as pending, while TP is up and setting up another node with same config and private key with same docker-compose file it seemed to have synced all the blocks. so the smart-contract seems to be deterministic still." priority="2" status="10100" created="2020-03-26 17:03:04.0" updated="2020-05-15 15:48:12.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="58587" archived="N"> <description><! CDATA I have a setup of 3 nodes which are rarely ever given batches to process. The batches themselves usually hold one transaction. After a period of time these nodes randomly stop syncing to each other. one node is at 244 blocks while others are at 302.  Other to nodes are able to accept transactions and publish blocks but this node doesn't seem to be responsive and doesn't throw anything in logs either. Restarting the node with all of its services or restarting the whole network doesn't make any difference.   Eventually we gave up on the node and stopped it. And set up a new node with the same private key, configurations and services. This time it is able to sync all the blocks.  ></description> </Issue>

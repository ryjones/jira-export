CDATA Recommendation here is to keep the go-sdk in sawtooth-core, but as part of the release process, publish to hyperledger/sawtooth-go-sdk. Additional requirements for this will be including the protogen files as well as updating the paths to be friendly to 'go get'.       Another option is to publish to something like  https://gopm.io/,  but this requires installation of additional tools.   ></body> </Action>

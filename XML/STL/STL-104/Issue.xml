CDATA Currently, the xo examples do not handle possible hash collisions.  Instead, we have warnings like the following in xo python:  {noformat} # NOTE: Since the game data is stored in a Merkle tree, there is a # small chance of collision. A more correct usage would be to store # a dictionary of games so that multiple games could be store at # the same location. See the python intkey handler for an example # of this. if stored_name != name: raise InternalError("Hash collision") {noformat}  Since we use xo for our tutorials, we should provide a correct implementation which stores a list of games at the address instead of a single game, thus handling hash collisions properly.  Note that this will require an update to all xo TP implementations as well as any impacted documentation.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When using web sockets to subscribe to `/subscriptions` on the REST API, a client will immediately receive the state delta for the most recent block. This is counter-intuitive as the subscription _should_ be for all _new_ deltas. The most recent block may in fact be quite old.     This also conflicts with the guidance in the documentation:  _"If you are interested in the state prior to the point of subscription, you should fetch the values of state via the REST API's /state endpoint."_     If you first fetch from `/state`, and then attempt to combine it with subscription data, you will double whatever data was in the most recent block. Clients will have to take the extra step of filtering their data for uniqueness or dropping the first delta the receive.  ></description> </Issue>

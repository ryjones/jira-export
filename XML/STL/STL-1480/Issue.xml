CDATA I compared Grid and the old Supply Chain github repos, https://github.com/hyperledger/grid with https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain, and Grid is missing important setup information in the README file. I don't know how anyone is expected to use it!  Here is the link to the missing README information:   https://github.com/hyperledger/education-sawtooth-simple-supply/blob/master/course_modules/edX%20201%20Module%201%20-%20intro%20-%20Sawtooth%20for%20Application%20Development.pdf   Â   Now Grid has a very unfriendly README introduction to those who intend to use it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Provide a design for custom metadata on the Record and Agent state structures.  This must support at least key-value pairs of strings.    Updating this data should be only allowed by the owner of the structures (either the Agent or the current owner of the Record).    Include the necessary changes to the supply chain database schema and state delta subscriber output.  Related to, and possibly supersedes STL-314   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently poet has default values in the code. Those defaults can be overridden by changing settings in state.  This is an incomplete solution though, because if a new node is launched with different code with different defaults, there's no way for that node to get into agreement with the others.  Instead, all PoET settings should be added to state before poet can be started.   ></description> </Issue>

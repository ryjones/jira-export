CDATA Implement browser-side account creation and private key generation, with server-side storage of account information, including encrypted private key.      Because they are so closely tied, this will necessarily include the implementation of user authorization as well.     This task includes implementing both POST /authorization and PATCH /user as defined in the design document.     This task does not include any transaction submission to the validator, nor a fully fleshed out login page.  ></description> </Issue>

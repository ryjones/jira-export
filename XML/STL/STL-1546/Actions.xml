CDATA {color:#525252}This task includes Sphinx file-redirection magic that was explained offline, circa April 20, 2019 (from Ben): {color}{color:#525252} {color} {quote}demo updated with a POC for page redirects. _This small change won’t go into any PR_. In this alternate reality, “pike” used to be called “porcupine”, so the page has moved.  The procedure is 2 steps: # Add the old page to name to {{conf.py}}:{{exclude_patterns:}} # Change the old page contents to .. note:: This page has moved: :doc:{{pike_transaction_family}} .. include:: pike_transaction_family.rst```  … and you get this,  http://photino.internal.bitwise.io/docs/porcupine_transaction_family.html  Again, this is just a what-if test. {quote}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I analyzed doc file names and determined that the only egregious confusion is from `{{setting_up_sawtooth_poet-sim.rst}}`.  A few other names are merely slightly confusing, so they can be done in a later cleanup pass.     Marking this story as done for chime/1.2.  ></body> </Action>

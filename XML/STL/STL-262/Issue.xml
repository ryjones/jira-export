<Issue id="16921" key="STL-262" number="262" project="10001" reporter="delventhalz" creator="delventhalz" type="10006" summary="Implement /authorization route for REST API" priority="3" status="10404" created="2017-05-19 19:28:02.0" updated="2021-03-15 18:31:23.0" votes="1" watches="3" workflowId="16925"> <description><! CDATA This task involves creating two new endpoints for the REST API as defined here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcHE1ecWAD3FvhftPoiR4w9c8TuUIrNN7MXtFdoYiy4/edit?usp=sharing      The endpoints: * *GET /authorization* - returns an empty JWT with a 1-hour expiration as a nonce * *POST /authorization* - accepts a JSON body with a public key, the nonce, and a signature of the nonce, and returns an API key if verification passes.  Verification must happen on both the JWT nonce and the signature. Then the endpoints authorization list on the blockchain must be queried to check which endpoints if any the public key is authorized for. The API Key should be JWT formatted, with both the public key and the fetched endpoint information included.     This task will be complete when both endpoints behave as expected.  ></description> </Issue>

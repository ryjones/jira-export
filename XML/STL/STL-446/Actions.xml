CDATA Hopefully this is the right place for this:  Basic operational metrics we're interested in: * block progress per validator * number of transaction aborts * tx counter by family * tx latency by family * merkle tree "size" for some definition of size * known peer count (from the perspective of each peer)  I recommend *against* two things:    UDP-based metrics (statsd)    "Average" metrics – you can always derive the averages from counters or gauges   We use  Prometheus.io|http://prometheus.io/  internally here, have had great success with it.  Pull-based metrics seem counterintuitive but they have significant advantages compared to UDP-based ("push") metrics like statsd.  It's conceptually very simple and if I were a betting man, prometheus will outlast influx / statsd.   https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/    https://github.com/prometheus/client_python      ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thanks Shayban.  I saw you comment on rocket chat last week and I'm taking a look at Prometheus.  I will also take into consideration your recommendations above.  In your internal code do you have a shim that makes it agnostic to the data collection tool, or are you "all in' with Prometheus?  Sawtooth may be deployed in data centers where other metrics tools are in use, and where consequently Prometheus instrumentation will not be helpful.  ></body> </Action>

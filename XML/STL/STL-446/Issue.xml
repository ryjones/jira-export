CDATA The output of this work should be a list of metrics the validator could/should log.  Descriptions of the metrics can be brief.  It does not need to include OS metrics, as those are collected with telegraph outside of the validator process.  This list does not need to be 100% complete - we can add metrics later.  However, it does need to be close enough to inform the design of the stats/metrics library; in particular, we need to know the different types of metrics.  For example, we know some metrics are additive (such as number of blocks published) and some might be set (current length of chain), while others might be an average (txn rate).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In a highly-secured network, it may be desirable to limit network conversations at the transport layer to specific nodes with specific identities. Curve ZMQ Transport Layer Security provides the ability to authenticate both client and server as part of the socket negotiation. A scheme could be developed where nodes would receive sideband mappings of network identities to Curve ZMQ public keys. The connection with a target network identity would only succeed if the target server was able to show proof of access to the the associated private key. Additionally, the target server could authenticate the claimed identity of the incoming connection by referencing the public key associated with their claimed identity.  Design this.  ></description> </Issue>

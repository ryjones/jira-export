CDATA Update the validator: * Send a block to consensus as soon as it's received/created * Wait for a check_block() request from consensus * Validate the block and send a BlockValid/BlockInvalid  This was the original intent of the consensus API behavior, but right now the validator validates the block first before sending it to consensus.  This will require updates to PBFT (and possibly devmode, raft)  ></description> </Issue>

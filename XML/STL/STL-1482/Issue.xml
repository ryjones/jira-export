CDATA The current version of sawtooth-supply-chain repo uses Ubuntu 18 (Bionic) and the nightly (bleeding edge) Sawtooth 1.2.  I prefer something more stable--Sawtooth 1.1 (latest release, "Bumper"), which is only supported on Ubuntu 16 (Xenial).  *Workaround* Patch sawtooth-supply-chain, I follow these steps:  {{git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain cd sawtooth-supply-chain git diff 50c404c >bionic.patch patch --dry-run -R -p1 <bionic.patch patch           -R -p1 <bionic.patch sudo docker-compose up}}  (From Rocketchat #sawtooth-supply-chain discussion of January 24 and 29, 2019.)  From a Sawtooth FAQ review, this was suggested as a bug: > generator/source/faq/installation.rst >     $ git diff 50c404c >bionic.patch >     $ patch --dry-run -R -p1 <bionic.patch >     $ patch           -R -p1 <bionic.patch >     $ sudo docker-compose up >   @vaporos vaporos 4 hours ago  Member > We probably consider the necessity of this patch a bug?  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-website/pull/27  ></description> </Issue>

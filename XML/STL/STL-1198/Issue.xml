Current Master branch python sdk and go sdk (code snippet was in python, i was doing the same in go sdk and found this bug)" priority="3" status="10100" created="2018-04-26 21:13:13.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:34:05.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="29750"> <description><! CDATA If submit a transaction, fill "asdfsfasfss" as input address, the transaction will be rejected by validator:  !image-2018-04-26-17-08-12-168.png!  But when query this transaction status, it will always be "PENDING", I think it should be "INVALID". Here is the minimum code snippet to reproduce it: https://gist.github.com/ailisp/6293ebdac7d6a07c33d55c0ed33b03c7  (i'm running sawtooth by latest docker-compose)  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The xo TP and smoke tests don't test very much right now. xo smoke, for instance, verifies that nothing breaks when xo is run, but doesn't do any state checking at all  1 . They should be more extensive.   1  In this sense it's a true smoke test: "The phrase smoke test comes from electronic hardware testing. You plug in a new board and turn on the power. If you see smoke coming from the board, turn off the power. You don't have to do any more testing."  ></description> </Issue>

Create a few multi-validator compose files with various settings. Even better, create a configurable tool to generate such files. A good idea would be to use the integration test node controller ( https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/integration/sawtooth_integration/tests/node_controller.py|https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/integration/sawtooth_integration/tests/node_controller.py)  ) as a starting point. " priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-08-01 21:22:49.0" updated="2018-06-04 16:57:47.0" resolutiondate="2018-06-04 16:57:47.0" votes="1" watches="2" workflowId="19698"/>

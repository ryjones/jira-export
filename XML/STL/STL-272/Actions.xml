CDATA Care should be taken in using CBOR within state, as the various CBOR libraries do not necessarily produce the same bytes during encoding (due to library differences, tags, etc.).  The end result is your library of choice during implementation would become part of the specification and not just an implementation detail.  For any case that's not an example, protobuf is a better choice.  Using CBOR for transaction payload is not problematic at all since we do not require or expect to be able to repeat the encoding process.  ></body> </Action>

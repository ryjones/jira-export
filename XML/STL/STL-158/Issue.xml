The block publisher will repeatedly process the invalid batch, logging again and again that it is invalid. This is a modification to the intkey smoke test that recreates the issue :  https://chat.hyperledger.org/file-upload/Aq5gq6tFvq9Wy2cNj/causes_repeats.txt.  The issue can also be recreated by submitting the same transaction without a nonce so that the batch signature is a duplicate of an already committed batch." priority="2" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-05-08 18:50:36.0" updated="2017-05-22 14:41:05.0" resolutiondate="2017-05-22 14:41:05.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="16477"/>

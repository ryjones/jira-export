CDATA Currently, the Application Developer's guide's Environment Setup section for Docker requires the user to clone the git repository.  Instead, the guide should provide a link to download the compose file from the documentation.  The cleanest approach would probably be to copy the yaml file into the app dev guide directory within the Makefile, then link to that file.  This may be a bit tricky for PDF generation.  In that instance, we will want to link to the file on github or in-line the file within the PDF text itself. Sphinx-doc allows for format conditionals.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This bug happened because we removed seth cli functionality from the RPC container. The Docker-compose file has a command referencing the CLI which causes it to die.  In order to fix this, we also need to share a seth key directory between the two containers so the RPC can use keys generated by the cli container.  ></body> </Action>

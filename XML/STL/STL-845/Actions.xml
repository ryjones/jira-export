CDATA Additional comments from Graham (11/17/2017):  Further to the report below, some further classes of query which can cause a connection to the REST API to hang: * Queries to /receipts, with a list of two or more IDs, one or more of which are empty (essentially the same behaviour as previously reported for /batch_status). * Some types of query to /receipts containing NUL characters. This has not been fully characterised, but I now have 4 examples (including one where the zeros are in the endpoint path rather than the query string).  All of this would be covered by the argument validation recommended previously, however this does highlight the need for validation across the API as a whole rather than focussing on known conditions affecting individual endpoints, and for NUL characters to be handled appropriately. (Python should generally have no difficulty handling strings containing NULs, however I can imagine problems arising during serialisation/deserialization, and/or if modules are imported which have been implemented in C.)  ></body> </Action>

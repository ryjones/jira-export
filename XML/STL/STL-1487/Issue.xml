<Issue id="37592" key="STL-1487" number="1487" project="10001" reporter="achenette" assignee="amundson" creator="achenette" type="10004" summary="Broken Rust SDK links in Sawtooth core doc" priority="3" status="10100" created="2019-02-11 16:29:03.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:33:44.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="49206"> <description><! CDATA The Rust SDK links are broken on the SDK Reference intro page ( https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sdks.html ) in the Sawtooth core documentation. * Transaction Processor:  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/rust_sdk/doc/sawtooth_sdk/processor/index.html#http://   * Signing:  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/rust_sdk/doc/sawtooth_sdk/signing/index.html#http://    It's not clear if the auto doc generation is broken or if the docs ARE being created but are stored in a different location.  A fix should also investigate why the doc adds `#http:://` to some links, including this one, and determine if it can be omitted. Note that working SDK links (in the past) have included this string, so the failure does not appear to be caused by this string.  ></description> </Issue>

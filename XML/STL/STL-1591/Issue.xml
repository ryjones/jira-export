CDATA When Sabre was first written there was not a version of rust-crypto that could be compiled into wasm so I created a fork that removed everything except the functiality we needed for the smart contracts so it could be compiled into wasm. Now there is a fork of rust crypto that can be compiled in called rust-crypto-wasm.

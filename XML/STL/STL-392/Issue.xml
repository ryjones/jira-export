CDATA As defined, transactions must be wrapped in a Batch, and must contain the public key of the batch signer in the batcher_pubkey field. So a transaction is only wrapped in a batch, a batch must contain the complete transactions that the transaction_id list in the batch header.  A new handler is needed that checks the transaction_ids list in the batch header against the transaction list in the batch. Batches which don't contain the complete transactions that the transaction_id list in the batch header would be dropped.  ></description> </Issue>

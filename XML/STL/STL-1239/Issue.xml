CDATA _*Problem statement*_:  Encrypting data in the TP and writing to state was our first thought however; as the TP may/will be called more than once (Publish/Verify/Etc.) good encryption will produce different encrypted data and thus fail in the validator. This applies not just for single validator/TP but is exacerbated in a validator network.     _*Improvement:*_  Enable encrypt/decrypt to/from state while not violating the hash generation for validator comparison.  Have ability for application to pass the encryption 'key' aligned by family namespace/version.     ></description> </Issue>

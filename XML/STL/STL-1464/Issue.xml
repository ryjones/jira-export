CDATA Our protobufs include a placeholder enum value (some variation of "UNSET") to avoid default assignment and errors that could arise from that.    https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/commit/014a775c2094e27b1d1b4114aaebacaca195cff4   The docs could be updated with a note to point out the intended use of this value. i.e. it is not a type or an operation itself and that failing to explicitly set one of the remaining values for the field will cause the transaction to fail.   Here is an example area in the Identity Transaction Family doc where the note could be placed but the unset field is used in a variety of places as indicated in the commit linked above).   https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blame/master/docs/source/transaction_family_specifications/identity_transaction_family.rst#L48      ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently shutdown happens slowly with intermittent failures, when no batches are sent to the validator.   After this task is finished, an integration test that sends batches to two connected and peered validators and then asserts that each validator will give a return code of 0 within 35 seconds after either SIGINT or SIGTERM, will pass reliably.  ></description> </Issue>

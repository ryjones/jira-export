CDATA When removing a node from a Raft network's membership, the leader's validator would report this error and stop sending all messages:  {{{{{{ 03:04:13.950  InterconnectThread-16  interconnect ERROR  An error occurred while sending heartbeat: 'NoneType' object is not callable}}}}}} {{ {{ {{Traceback (most recent call last):}}}}}} \{{ {{ {{ File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sawtooth_validator/networking/interconnect.py", line 576, in _monitor_disconnects}}}}}} \{{ {{ {{ self._check_connections()}}}}}} {{ {{ {{TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable}}}}}}  A node is removed from the Raft network's membership by removing it from the list of peers in the "sawtooth.consensus.raft.peers" setting. When this happens, the leader sends the change to all nodes and all nodes stop sending messages to or receiving messages from the removed node. The leader's validator then reports the above error and stops sending messages to or receiving messages from all other validators, while the remaining nodes continue operating properly and communicating amongst each other.  ></description> </Issue>

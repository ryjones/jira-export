CDATA The State interface, including proto definitions, doesn't handle null values and from the sdk's perspective null and empty bytes are the same. Because of how Protocol Buffers version 3 works, bytes fields have an empty bytes string as a default. This  Github issue |https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/1606 gives Oneof fields as an alternative to null values.  Â   In concert with STL-399, update the sdks to handle null values.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the block store, global state, and transaction receipt databases all use the last two characters of the validator's network endpoint in their file names. The reason for doing this originally was to support multiple validators on the same machine but the network endpoint is not the right place to pull a unique identifier (it was used for historical reasons). Instead, multiple validators should be supported on the same machine by either:  1. Requiring separate data directories for different validators (configured using the path configuraiton) 2. Pulling a unique identifier from the validator's public key.  ></description> </Issue>

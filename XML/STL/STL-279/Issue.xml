CDATA The release of pylint 1.7.x broke builds.  As a workaround, we pinned the docker pip installs at 1.6.5 so builds continue to work.  Linting in the vagrant environment is currently broken as it installs 1.7.x which the code does not pass.  At the completion of this task:  - sawtooth-core will support the latest pylint 1.7.x - pylint will no longer be pinned to a specific version withing docker or vagrant   ></description> </Issue>

The timer nonce is currently initialized during creation of the wait timer, but the value is thrown away and not used when checking the duration during wait certificate creation. This would allow for a potential attack based on re-initialization of the ME timer." priority="3" status="10100" created="2018-01-03 17:19:54.0" updated="2019-05-21 14:34:13.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="26354"/>

CDATA The current PoET tests (test_poet_smoke, test_dynamic_network) are insufficient for gating PRs. They only test that the nodes are in consensus after a period of time. This means that the test will succeed even if no blocks are published after the genesis block.  In the interest of getting LR networks to pass, an additional integration test will be created to test that PoET is behaving correctly. The test should be an abbreviate version of the LR network tests. At a minimum, it should test that: 1. Blocks are being published at approximately the correct rate. (liveness)  2. Batches are being consumed at approximately the correct rate. (liveness)  3. Blocks contain batches. (liveness)  4. The nodes stay in consensus. (correctness)  ></description> </Issue>

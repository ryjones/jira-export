CDATA Reorganize and reformat the Sawtooth Docs web page to improve usability and appearance.  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/   https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/   Clarify the doc links with respect to releases and make information easier to find (fewer old STL releases on the top page, more products "above the fold", clarify what "nightly master" means, etc.). Consider putting very old releases on a subpage to reduce clutter and confusion.  Determine a best-practices design by evaluating other doc pages, such as these examples:  https://docs.geoserver.org|https://docs.geoserver.org/    https://coreos.com/tectonic/releases/ https://coreos.com/docs/  |https://coreos.com/tectonic/releases/   http://docs.h2o.ai |http://docs.h2o.ai/ (see Sparkling Water)  https://gradle.org/releases/    https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/    https://developer.openstack.org|https://developer.openstack.org/         See also STL-1644.     ></description> </Issue>

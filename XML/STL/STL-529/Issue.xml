CDATA Challenge Authorization should be used when enforcing connection against public keys. This should include:  Proto files for ChallengeAuthorization messages  Finally, requesting Validators will respond with AuthorizationChallengeRequest.  The validator will send a AuthorizationChallengeResponse, which include a payload that must be signed.   The requesting validator will respond with a AuthorizationChallengeSubmit that includes the signature, public key, and requested roles  The validator will respond with AuthorizationChallengeResult and if accepted with roles allowed.  The network will then function as normal after this point.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When I submit a transaction which ultimately fails due to {{REVERT}} or some other reason, the transaction receipt is never retrievable.     Reproduction steps: # Ensure you have nodejs v8.2 or later installed. # Install truffle with {{npm install -g truffle@beta}} # Clone the project at  https://github.com/benjamincburns/seths-petshop   # run {{npm install}} in the cloned project to install dependencies # Edit {{truffle-config.js}} to point at your Seth RPC endpoint. # Ensure that one or more accounts is unlocked by running seth's RPC with the `--unlock` flag. # Run `truffle compile && truffle migrate` to compile and deploy the project's contracts # Run {{DEBUG='SethProvider:RPC' truffle test}}     The project contains only one test which is designed to trigger a {{REVERT}}. You'll notice in the debug output that Truffle tries over and over to fetch a single transaction receipt, but the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` for that call always returns `null`.  ></description> </Issue>

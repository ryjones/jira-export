CDATA Create a rust language based Raft implementation with the new consensus engine. It is highly desirable but not required that Bitwise IO use an existing Raft implementation (such as https://github.com/pingcap/tikv) as a library.  This prototype integration may not satisfy production criteria, and thus may not be suitable for production or LR testing. Bitwise IO shall design and document additional work required to make it production ready, suitable for community consumption.  The integration must be able to pass a liveness test similar to the existing PoET liveness test with 3 nodes.   ></description> </Issue>

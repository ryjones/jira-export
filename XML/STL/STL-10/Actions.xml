<Action id="19541" issue="13006" author="mfford" type="comment" body="What we ended up going with is adding self.public_key to SignedObject. When verify signature is called it checks the expected public_key against the the originator_public_key that is generated from the serialized object and the signature. If they differ, the signed_object (transaction) has been modified and is not valid. This fixes all transaction families since SignedObject is the superclass to all transactions." created="2016-10-28 14:12:42.0" updateauthor="mfford" updated="2016-10-28 14:12:42.0"/>

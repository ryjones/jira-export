CDATA I'm experiencing a similar problem on a network of 4 nodes with sawtooth 1.0.5: when the backpressure kicks in, it is never released and the validator don't accept new batches, though he still able to process blocks.  Something noticeable too, is that when the back pressure kicks in on one node, it propagates to the other nodes at the next batch they receive.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The back pressure warning was a red herring with my problems. My issue had nothing to do with the backpressure warning. The issue was that the `sawtooth_validator_registry` transaction family was not added to the `sawtooth.settings.transaction_families` which allowed the validators to process transactions up to a certain number of blocks and then freeze with the back pressure triggered. Restarting the validator would let him restart until he locked himself again. In case something like that happens to someone else, the error message of the validator for this is  ``` 2018-09-01 17:52:02.632 ERROR    poet_block_publisher  My poet registration using PPK XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX has not committed by block ecc1eeae2bb5ad586e919b600f04c25944a19617c47b5f5db193f588ccd7f24a0472bd3386ca445b31bcea2002777473ad9d9befcec1f05a4cde8f7391e8dc33.

CDATA  ~mithun2679  see script below, you can play with the numbers to improve reproduction rate, the more pressure on the TP/validator the more likely to see the problem, on some iterations i saw the queue limit was down to 2  #!/bin/bash for((i=1;i<=10;++i)) do echo "loop iteration $i started" intkey workload --rate 10 -d 5 & sleep 15 kill -9 %%  intkey workload --rate 150 -d 2 & sleep 3 kill -9 %%  echo "loop iteration $i completed" done  ></body> </Action>

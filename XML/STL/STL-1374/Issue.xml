CDATA NUC with sawtooth installed from stable repo.  Â   ></environment> <description><! CDATA queue size doesn't have a minimum.  running sawtooth 1.0.5 on one node with intkey TP  cretead simple script that is using intkey workload to send 10 txns per second and every 20 seconds send 100 txns per second for 2 seconds.  the expected result is that during the peak lots of txns will be rejected but after peak we should go back to normal.  what happens is that because of peaks the journal queue gets smaller and smaller, causing validator to reject more transaction than needed.  see attached validator log from stress, line 3952 for example, applying back pressure when there are only 7 txns in the Q:  32m 2018-09-05 16:36:58.665 INFO back_pressure_handlers  0m  37mApplying back pressure on client submitted batches: current depth: 7, limit: 6.8 0m  Â   Â   ></description> </Issue>

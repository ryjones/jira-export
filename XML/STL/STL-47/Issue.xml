CDATA Complete the integration of the Parallel Scheduler branch into master and complete implementation, documentation, and testing associated with the existing Hyperledger Sawtooth 0.8 Parallel and Serial Scheduler designs. This work will be delivered in the form of git commits submitted through the established PR process to the sawtooth-core (or other appropriate) repository.  The Parallel Scheduler feature will add implementation and and testing necessary to execute transactions in parallel based on input/output and dependency hints set by clients during batch creation.  This epic is considered complete when the following has been accomplished and merged into master:  - Context manager fully supports concepts necessary for correct serial and parallel scheduling - Context manager enforces input/outputs correctly - Parallel Scheduler is implemented - Basic correctness unit tests for the Parallel Scheduler implementation - Parallel Scheduler intkey-based integration smoke test is enabled - Validator can be configured to use either the serial or the parallel scheduler via file configuration and a validator CLI option  The basic correctness tests should demonstrate that the parallel scheduler and serial scheduler produce the same results for various workloads.  (They should produce the same state merkle root after execution.)     ></description> </Issue>

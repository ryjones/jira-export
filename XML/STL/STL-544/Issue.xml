CDATA The path an address takes from when it is passed as an argument to seth to when it is used to update state should be traced and the type and number of transformations should be simplified. This may mean storing EVM addresses as strings in state to reduce the amount of encoding/decoding in which case it should only be needed in transaction handlers prior to interacting with SawtoothAppState.  ></description> </Issue>

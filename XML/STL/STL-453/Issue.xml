CDATA Currently, contract chaining is not possible because only the address of the sender account and receiver account are passed as inputs and outputs when submitting a transaction.  To support contract chaining, it should be made possible to pass the burrow-EVM namespace prefix as inputs and output when submitting a transaction.  The inputs/outputs are set here:   https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/families/burrow_evm/src/sawtooth_burrow_evm/client/client.go#L60    https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/families/burrow_evm/src/sawtooth_burrow_evm/client/client.go#L106   Â   ></description> </Issue>

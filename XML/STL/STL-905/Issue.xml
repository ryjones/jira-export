CDATA Validator registration requires a nonce referencing the latest block.  That is overly restrictive. The freshness goal is to make it unlikely that a validator was revoked from the EPID group at the time of registration.  Something on the order of 10 blocks should still be more than sufficient.  The current harm from the 1 block requirement is that it's very likely that a validator's signup will fail in proportion to the load on the network. i.e. the signup transaction can't be guaranteed to commit within 1 block of the validator creating the registration transaction.     Update code and Spec.  ></description> </Issue>

This will cause more txns than are in the scheduler to be run, but there should be only 1 final txn_result per txn. After this task there should be unittests and yaml based scheduler tests for this functionality and the parallel scheduler should be passing them." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-06-19 01:32:54.0" updated="2017-07-10 19:33:28.0" resolutiondate="2017-07-10 14:09:02.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="18291"/>

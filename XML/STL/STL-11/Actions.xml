CDATA Of course, If using ECDSA , we could replace the `PublickKey` with an 'Address'  field in the current Participant register transaction in step 2. Then  in step 7, the validator could recover a public_key with the cbor binary of the transaction and the signature, invokes PubKeyToAddress with the public_key to get an address, compares the address and the value of 'Address' field, if equal, passes the validation.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA mfford @flyingtiger.feihu Thanks for submitting the proposal! We'll take a look at it.  amundson @flyingtiger.feihu - is your proposal specific to to mktplace?  flyingtiger.feihu @amundson The process I described in proposal is for the participant register in mktplace , However, I think the method can be applied to other  transaction families that include such identity management .  for example, XoTransaction.  flyingtiger.feihu @mfford The method I described in the proposal could also fix the bug of XoTransaction in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-9 .  agunde @flyingtiger.feihu Thanks for the proposal. What we ended up going with is adding self.public_key to SignedObject. When verify signature is called it checks the expected public_key against the the originator_public_key that is generated from the serialized object and the signature. If they differ, the signed_object (transaction) has been modified and is not valid. This fixes all transaction families since SignedObject is the superclass to all transactions.    Thanks again for pointing out this issue.  ></body> </Action>

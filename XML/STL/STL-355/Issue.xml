CDATA We need to add logging support to all long-running processes (sawtooth-validator, sawtooth-rest-api, TPs).  By default, we should log both debug and error logs, with the ability to supply logging configuration to each command.  Since multiple of each process could be run on a single host, a unique ID must be added tot he log files to differentiate them.  This will look something like:  {noformat} /var/log/sawtooth/ sawtooth-validator-ID-debug.log sawtooth-validator-ID-error.log sawtooth-rest-api-ID-debug.log sawtooth-rest-api-ID-error.log intkey-tp-go-ID-debug.log intkey-tp-go-ID-error.log intkey-tp-python-ID-debug.log intkey-tp-python-ID-error.log ... xo-tp-go-ID-debug.toml xo-tp-go-ID-error.toml xo-tp-python-ID-debug.toml xo-tp-python-ID-error.toml ... noop-go-ID-debug.toml noop-go-ID-error.toml supplychain-tp-ID-debug.toml supplychain-tp-ID-error.toml poet-validator-registry-ID-debug.toml poet-validator-registry-ID-error.toml {noformat}  In addition to log file support, each process should support syslog.  This should be done in a configurable manner, such as that provided by the python logging library, log4j, and log4j-like libraries.  STL-358 will determine how this should be placed into configuration files.  ></description> </Issue>

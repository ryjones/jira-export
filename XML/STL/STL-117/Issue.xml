CDATA This issue arose: A user following the tutorial found that the documentation was not in sync with the sawtooth lake code available on the docker container.  Solution:  Documentation should exist in two versions: * master * stable  Developers can then choose which docs to use based on which version of the code they are using.  App developers would generally use stable. Core developers might use either stable or master.    ></description> </Issue>

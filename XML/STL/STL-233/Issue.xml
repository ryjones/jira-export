CDATA The dynamic network test starts nodes using Subprocess. They should be started (and stopped) using Docker instead. The challenge is to create containers sibling to the test container while still being able to keep track of and communicate with those containers from within the test container.  This will probably take care of the 'address in use' error that has been failing tests recently.  The test's "node controller" (`/integration/sawtooth_integreation/tests/node_controller.py`) is written in such a way that it should be possible to substitute Docker for Subprocess without disturbing the test itself much.  This task seems to require a somewhat deep understanding of Docker.  ></description> </Issue>

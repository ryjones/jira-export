CDATA Currently, a full state request is performed and the data received is deserialized every time information about an account or storage is requested from the validator. This is unnecessary overhead, since the state is guaranteed not to change in between requests to the validator, unless specifically changed by the processor.  To improve performance, a cache of account and storage information should be implemented between the Burrow-EVM Transaction Processor and the Validator. This could be implemented as part of the StateManager or SawtoothAppState classes, or possibly as a separate class.

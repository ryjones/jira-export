CDATA Add new info to the App Dev and Sys Admin Guides: Each key in sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members must be surrounded with double quotes. If the setting is changed on the command line (with sawset proposal create), you must use single quotes around the entire string to protect the double quotes from the shell.  Note: This issue was discovered during Chime testing.  ></description> </Issue>

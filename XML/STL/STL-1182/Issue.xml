CDATA The BlockValidator validates that a block is valid beyond those checks that happen at other levels (such as signature verification in the Gossip layer). This includes all batches are valid and the resulting state hash matches the one in the block header, the block contains a predecessor in the current chain, there are no duplicate transactions or batches, all transaction dependencies are satisfied, settings stored in state are satisfied, and identity state is satisfied by signatures of batches and transactions.  The BlockValidator maintains the correctness that all of a block's predecessors must be validated before it is validated.  The BlockValidator is an active component.        ></description> </Issue>

Here are the highlights: * There are 3 non-Apache components still in the codebase, two under MIT and one under a Zlib-style license. These are all permissive licenses which will likely be acceptable to the Governing Board. But they will still require exception approvals from the GB, per Hyperledger's IP Policy. * There remain about 300 files in the repo that don't contain an Apache-2.0 or CC-BY-4.0 license within the file itself. These do not require exception approval, but would likely be mentioned in the license report for the committee/board as an area for future improvement. * We would recommend that the community looks at adding SPDX short-form identifiers to individual files, as a quicker and more efficient way to add licensing details. * Also, for this report, we are now counting separately any files that are completely empty (e.g., fully empty __init__.py files). These are now listed separately in the report from other files with content but no license info.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA New upload sawtooth-2018-07-27.xls. Notes for sawtooth scan 2018-07-27:  1) In the sawtooth-sabre repo, the file at /tp/Cargo.toml lists "Apache" as the license. Could this be updated to "Apache-2.0", to avoid any ambiguity in the metadata about which version of the Apache license applies?  2) The great majority of Sawtooth source code files contain Apache-2.0 notices. Thank you for all your help on this.  In the "No license found" tab of the spreadsheet, the files with "No license found" do not contain license notices that were detected from our scanning. Where reasonably possible, for those files that contain Hyperledger code, Apache-2.0 comments should be added.

CDATA New upload sawtooth-2018-09-26.xlsx  Notes from sawtooth-2018-09-26.xlsx scan: * This was a special scan for the 1.1 branch of sawtooth-core (plus the master branch for the other Sawtooth repos). * The main question from the Legal Subcommittee would be about the /NOTICES files in *sawtooth-core* and *sawtooth-poet*. These files were not present for the final pre-release scan for 1.0 that the subcommittee reviewed earlier this year. Most of the components listed in these files may be coming from the developers' own scans or reviews. They describe components that do not appear to be contained within the source code repos themselves (so the FOSSology license scans I've run do not detect them).  From that file, the following software + licenses are the ones that may raise some particular concern with the Legal Subcommittee: - *zeromq* (LGPL-3.0-only WITH ZeroMQ-linking-exception) - *cchardet* (MPL-1.1) - *zeromq jeromq* (MPL-2.0) - *OpenSSL* (OpenSSL license)  For each of these software components, it would be very helpful to have the developers weigh in on the following questions:  A) Is this component actually included in the sawtooth repo source code? Or is it a build-time or install-time dependency? B) What functionality does this component provide? C) What functional portion(s) of Sawtooth use this component? D) Is this component required for Sawtooth to function? E) Are there alternative third-party OSS components that provide equivalent functionality?  The answers to these questions (A in particular) would help the Legal Subcommittee / GB evaluate whether to approve these as exceptions to the Hyperledger IP policy.   * In the *sawtooth-sabre* repo, the file at /tp/Cargo.toml lists "Apache" as the license. Could this be updated to "Apache-2.0", to avoid any ambiguity in the metadata about which version of the Apache license applies? * In the *sawtooth-next-directory* repo, there are three files in /processore/rbac_processor that have incomplete Apache-2.0 license headers. These files are listed in the "Wrong license statement" tab of the report. Can these be updated to include the full standard Apache-2.0 header? * The great majority of Sawtooth source code files contain Apache-2.0 notices. Thank you for all your help on this.  In the "No license found" tab of the spreadsheet, the files with "No license found" do not contain license notices that were detected from our scanning. Where reasonably possible, for those files that contain Hyperledger code, Apache-2.0 comments should be added. This can be done by adding a comment with an SPDX short-form identifier, such as:     SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 Note that the files in this tab listed as "third party directory", "excluded file extension" or "empty file" do not need to have these notices added. Similarly, some of the files that are listed just as "No license found" may be in a format where it's not reasonably possible to add a license notice, and that's fine if so.  * Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, CC-BY-4.0, is the license for Hyperledger documentation. Many of the documentation files already have CC-BY-4.0 notices. For those Hyperledger documentation files that don't, consider adding notices to them, such as by using an SPDX short-form identifier:     SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0     More information for the last two bullets can be found on the Hyperledger wiki, at  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/copyright-and-license-policy     ></body> </Action>

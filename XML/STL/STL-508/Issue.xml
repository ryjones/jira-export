CDATA When a batch is submitted via the REST API to a validator that is processing the genesis block, it will be lost.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Create a genesis block with at least one sawtooth settings transaction 2. Start a validator process 3. Start a REST API process 4. Submit an intkey transaction (via intkey load, for example).  5. Start {{tp_settings}} 6. Start {{tp_intkey_python}}  At this point, the genesis block will be created, but the intkey transaction(s) will not be processed.    To fix this, either:  - the batch should be preserved in a pending queue (which would require journal being active) - do not accept client messages until the genesis block is complete (probably the most desirable)   ></description> </Issue>

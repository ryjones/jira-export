CDATA This Epic has two phases:  1. Produce a design document detailing a solution which enables developers already using Ethereum Solidity language and tools to transition smoothly to working with Sawtooth's Burrow-based EVM transaction family.  2. Implement, document, and provide tests for Solidity Developer Compatibility per the design.   Enable existing Solidity smart contract developers to: # Migrate their existing Solidity smart contracts and the applications built around those smart contracts to Sawtooth from Burrow or Public Ethereum # Reuse the familiar Solidity tools solc and web3.js while developing for Sawtooth  ></description> </Issue>

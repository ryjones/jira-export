CDATA Currently they are ignored except when creating contract accounts. Below is a partial list of the additional work that needs to be done: * Whenever a contract is called, the nonce of the account associated with the contract must be incremented. * If a transaction submitted contains a nonce that does not match the (senderâ€™s?) account, the transaction is invalid. * Burrow stores nonces as an int64 but since the nonce is a monotonically increasing value starting at 0, it probably makes more sense for this to be a uint64. Currently a type cast is performed when translating between the transaction payload and the EVM call.  ></description> </Issue>

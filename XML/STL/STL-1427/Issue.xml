CDATA       To better accomodate parallel development, tests and evaluation on changes, and create a multi-threaded solution, I suggest a change on the current format of the project.     A multi-tiered Maven project would help in this, give the following: *   A parent POM, holding common artifacts, plugins and dependencies versions, building and configuration parameters, etc * Initially, the following modules: ** Commons : will hold the crypto settings and operations, marshall/unmarshall of messages, general utilities; ** Transaction Processor: hold the ZeroMQ setup and behavior, interfaces, messaging pipelines, etc; ** REST modules, initially based in Jersey : handle the REST elements and operations needed to interact with the validators        Since Java 9 is EOL, and 8 will be next year ( Oracle roadmap|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/eol-135779.html ) the SDK would use Java 10.     The use of TestNG on tests will be preferred over JUnit to reuse the tests results.         There's a  runnable code base|https://github.com/CarvalhoLeonardo/sawtooth-sdk-java/tree/development  that I intend to do layered PRs on the project, to furthr evaluation of my ideas. Please give all feedback you can.  ></description> </Issue>

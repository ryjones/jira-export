CDATA I believe we have a peering bug which is being caught periodically by the poet-smoke test. Examples of the bug are here: https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/PR-409/4/console https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/master/228/console https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/master/227/console https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/master/220/console  Using this branch I got a 4/5 failure rate doing `run_docker_test poet-smoke`: https://github.com/aludvik/sawtooth-core/tree/poet-bug  I ran it with debug level logging, and committed the log with interconnect messages filtered out: https://github.com/aludvik/sawtooth-core/blob/poet-bug/poet-smoke-fail-no-interconnect  You can see at the end of the logging, it goes into a spiral of responding to block requests.  ></description> </Issue>

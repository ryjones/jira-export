CDATA Currently, the "Testing a Transaction Processor" section documents use of TransactionProcessorTestCase from the perspective of writing code.  However, we do not provide instructions for the user on how to setup the environment to do this.  We need specific steps in the app dev guide on how to setup and run one of these tests.  Some questions to answer: does this require running TransactionProcessorTestCase in a docker container (or do we recommend it)?  If so, does the user need to modify the compose file? Can we provide an example with xo or intkey?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Issue happened because of missing condition check in poet_fork_resolver.py when same block arrives for compare_chains()  Detailed analysis: * The _pending_forks_to_resolve is to store chain heads of all the forks. * Crash occurred because the PendingForks data structure had element in queue, which is not in dictionary. This can only happen if duplicate entries are added to this data structure. * Validator can send duplicate blocks, which consensus engine has to take care of. * Long before the crash, thereâ€™s a block which is sent for fork resolution and consensus engine asks validator to commit the block which is already committed. * This corrupted environment in engine.py which corrupts PendingForks  ></body> </Action>

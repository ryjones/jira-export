CDATA {quote}From *Marc Vauclair:*  This is to mention that the link:  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/sdk  to be found here on page  https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth  is not right:  The SDKs are not located any more in the sawtooth-core project but rather each in a separate Git.  The same is true for the links to be found at bottom of page:  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.1.4/app_developers_guide/sdk_table.html   For example, the Sawtooth Python SDK is to be found here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-python  and the Rust SDK is to be found here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-rust .    {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

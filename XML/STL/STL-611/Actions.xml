CDATA PR 757 Did not complete this task: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/757  Appears to only releases the monotonic counter if the block limit(k test) is claimed on a signup info, if the signup info is registered on an abandoned fork or is not committed to the chain(included in the wrong block) the counters do not appear to be released.  A policy on how deep the fork is before release of a signup data may be appropriate. Once a fork has been abandoned for n blocks the signup data should be released.            ></body> </Action>

CDATA Need to release monotonic counters used by poet sgx enclave when they are no longer needed.     PoET validator code should call the release signup data method in the enclave to release the monotonic counter.  Proposed policy:  1. whenever k-test expires release signup data.   2. on uninstall  Other times may create issues with forks. We keep signup info in a little database to cover the case that a validator is registered differently on different forks. Releasing the counter prematurely will effectively unregister the validator.  ></description> </Issue>

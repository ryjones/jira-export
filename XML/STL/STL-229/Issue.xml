CDATA Currently, sawtooth-demo.yaml (soon sawtooth-default.yaml) sets up a specific configuration of sawtooth.  We need to determine what additional docker compose files we should add to the application developer's guide.  This could include mutli-validator networks, a simplified single validator network with no TPs, etc.  This JIRA should define the filenames of the docker compose files to be created and result in additional JIRA issues for adding them to sawtooth-core and the docs.  Those JIRA issues should be linked as related to this JIRA issue.  ></description> </Issue>

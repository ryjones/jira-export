CDATA In the Future section, the following suggestions/requirements are unmet:  “(Future criterion) The software produced by the project SHOULD support secure protocols for all of its network communications, such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP, and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 SHOULD be disabled by default, and only enabled if the user specifically configures it. If the software produced by the project does not support network comunications, select "not applicable" “  “(Future criterion) It is SUGGESTED that the project website, repository (if accessible via the web), and download site (if separate) include key hardening headers with nonpermissive values.”  “(Future criterion) It is SUGGESTED that hardening mechanisms be used in the software produced by the project so that software defects are less likely to result in security vulnerabilities.”  https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/954/edit#future  ></description> </Issue>

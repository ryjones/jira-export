Further issues have been opened for explicit dependencies, STL-499, and replay of transactions in batches that have an invalid txn, STL-476. Along with STL-488, the parallel scheduler should be able to be used in place of the serial scheduler." created="2017-06-21 14:29:17.0" updateauthor="boydjohnson" updated="2017-06-21 14:29:17.0"/>

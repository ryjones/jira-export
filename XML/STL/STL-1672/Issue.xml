CDATA Please support offchain configuration for the pbft members.  Itâ€™s very dangerous to update the onchain settings for pbft members. The network admin may update the pbft members list in an incorrect way like the number is less than 4 or the public key is not surrouned by quotes, these wrong configurations will make the pbft engine crash and the network will never have a chance to go back.  Another solution is to write our own client to update the onchain settings with validity checking. This needs every network admin to write his own tools.. An official client should be provided.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, we do not provide a specific version in the documentation indicating what tag produced that documentation.  For example, if I'm looking at the stable docs, it does not tell me that it is for v0.8.5.  As a reader, that would be potentially useful information to embed in the documentation either on the index page or in the header.  We could potentially integration version in the docs conf.py with our version command in bin/.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  Make consensus-related changes to Hyperledger Sawtooth in preparation for future consensus algorithm integration. These changes will be consistent with the consensus design work from 2017 Q4, with changes necessary for rBFT and separation of consensus state from global state. Specifically, this will include separation of consensus into another process and implementing a Python consensus engine SDK for use by PoET and a Rust consensus engine SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

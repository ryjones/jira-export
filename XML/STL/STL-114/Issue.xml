CDATA Currently, our published documentation is not in-sync with our stable debian packages and stable docker images.  This is causing app developer confusion.  Instead, we should publish stable documentation at the same time we publish the debian/docker artifacts.  We should also generate master as we do now, but in a different URL (similar to what we do for 0.7).  ></description> </Issue>

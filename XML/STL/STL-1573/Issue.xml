CDATA The devmode consensus engine configuration file has the command line arguments commented out, which is inconsistent with other components of the system.  In addition, there is a statement in main.rs which is intended to set a default connection value of "tcp://localhost:5050", however, if the engine is run with the command line arguments commented out, or with command line arguments that do not specify a server connection, the consensus engine does not connect and cannot validate.  Seems to be a cause of STL 1535  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Multiple people have had this issue, so I am creating a bug for it.  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/29598771f8859875118183a2db4e75307e831e9f/validator/sawtooth_validator/consensus/proxy.py#L308   @gandhikim, and @rajaramkannan have experience this issue  RajaramKannan - Below is the steps we were able to recreate with # Note: Using Validator 1.1.5 and PBFT 1.0.1 # We have a 4 node network in our test environment running PBFT.  # We sent in a 100 transactions that did not write anything to state. # On sending the 101st transaction we see the above issue. # If we restart the validator it immediately crashes with a similar KeyError exception.      ></description> </Issue>

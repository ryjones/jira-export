CDATA Even though the BlockValidator will be separate from the ChainController, they are still tightly coupled because: 1. The ChainController manages blocks in process and blocks pending 2. The ChainController acts as an intermediary between the completer and BlockValidator 3. The ChainController creates the consensus module used by the BlockValidator for validation when the BlockValidator could do this 4. The BlockValidator keeps track of the chain head and validation results contain the chain head instead of the previous block.  ></description> </Issue>

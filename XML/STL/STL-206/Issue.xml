CDATA The State class is synchronous and after sending a message to the validator, it expects the next message it receives to be a response to that message. This imposes the requirement that handlers be single threaded. This could be solved by making the State class multithreaded and changing the Get() and Set() methods to return channels instead of directly returning the responses.  ></description> </Issue>

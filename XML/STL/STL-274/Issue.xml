CDATA Restrict batch submission to a limited set of signing keys, maintained either at the edge in a configuration file.  A list of public keys will be stored in a file configuration file and only batches signed with those public keys will be accepted.  This would allow batch submission permissioning which is controlled independently at each node.  This should work in combination with STL-276 and be implemented using the interconnect handler mechanism.  ></description> </Issue>

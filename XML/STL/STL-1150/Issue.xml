CDATA Hi all,  This may be a bit of a newbie question, and apologies for that.  I have played with Hyperledger Sawtooth and got the intkey demo successfully working with various SDK languages.  One of the things that I can see that the intkey demo can do is change the value associated with a given name as stored in the system state.  One of the things that I would be interested in is storing data in a completely immutable way in sawtooth. I understand that the blocks themselves are immutable, but IIUC the blocks aren't really used for storing data, but rather storing a reference to the data...   It also possible to store data in an immutable way?   Many thanks,   David  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I want to submit a contract creation transaction from terminal via seth-rpc. I created myalias as an account in seth-cli-go and then i connected to seth-rpc and try to unlock the account but got error, "Account not found".  I added  "- sawtooth:/root/.sawtooth" under the "volumes" section of seth-cli-go and then it worked.  After that i ran `curl -d '\{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_sign", "id": 1, "params":  myaliasAddress, message }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3030` to get signature of myalias on  `message` but i got error "Account with address `myaliasAddress` not found."  I am stuck on this for the last 2 days and have already spent 12hrs on this, can't find any solution anywhere!!     ></description> </Issue>

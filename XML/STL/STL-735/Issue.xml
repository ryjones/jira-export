CDATA The "sawtooth keygen" usage text is missing from the CLI Reference chapter of the Sawtooth doc. Assuming that the usage file is being generated, it simply needs to be included in the CLI "contents" file.  If the usage file isn't being generated, or if there's no usage text in the code, I'll need to pull in someone else to help with the fix.  ></description> </Issue>

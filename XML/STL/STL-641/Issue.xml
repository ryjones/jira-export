CDATA It is possible for signupdata to be corrupted. This could include file errors or release of the monotonic counter.  The enclave will throw an exception but the poet code in the validator process should have additional handling.   It should detect that the signup data is no longer valid and that it must re-signup.   This handling should be added to the poet_block_publisher around calls to create_wait_timer and create_wait_certificate.  Possibly update unseal_signup_data (particularly in the sgx code) to check the counter and return a distinct indication that the signup_data is unusable. Then use the unseal method as a guard in front of the create wait timer and certificate calls.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The hardcoded 'public network instance' Curve ZMQ keys should be moved out of the code into a local config file (depends on the completion of local config stories). Moving the keys to local config would allow a basic configuration of a secured network based on sideband sharing of a single network keypair to all participating nodes.  Make sure that the choice of configuration plays nicely with the planned design for a stronger 'per-node' key scheme.  ></description> </Issue>

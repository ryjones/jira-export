CDATA Hi Will,  I really appreciate your effort. Did you check the documentation to python call recv_multipart()? It doesn't make sense to me trying to fit list into 2 variables like it's implemented.  IMHO this cause the issue. Upper languages like python and RUST are maybe able to send such a message in one frame, but c++ strictly split the message to multipart.     Please consider my note.   ></body> </Action>

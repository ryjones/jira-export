CDATA * Latest sawtooth-core release * Ubuntu bionic, but the OS is in this case irrelevant  ></environment> <description><! CDATA When you try to startup any C++ transaction processor you will get python exception in validator:   2020-05-15 01:44:06.927 ERROR interconnect  Received a message on address tcp://127.0.0.1:4004 that caused an error: too many values to unpack (expected 2) Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sawtooth_validator/networking/interconnect.py", line 368, in _receive_message yield from self._socket.recv_multipart() ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)     The most important question is: Are you gonna still support C++ SDK? When I see your effort and contributions I got feelings that you pushing development into RUST and now necessary Python.      You setup the priority as you want to. For me this issue is critical because not any home-made transaction processor can work without the fix. It of course forced me to fixed it already.   ></description> </Issue>

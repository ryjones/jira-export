CDATA Currently the Config Transaction Family only supports proposals for replacing a setting entirely with a new one. This is technically usable for storing long lists of public-keys, but becomes very unfriendly as those lists get long and they are edited more frequently.  Â   Two new "verbs" should be added to the ConfigProposals in addition to "set": * "append" - add the specified value to the end of the setting with an optional delimiter (defaults to ",") * "remove" - finds a value within a setting and removes, based on an optional delimiter (defaults to ",")  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Design a method of exposing block information to transaction processors.  In particular, block number, block hash, and block timestamp.  At least two approaches should be considered (S0=starting state, S1=final state; T=transaction; B=block):  1. Inserting transactions into the block to update state (keeping S0+T->S1); or 2. Supplying a method for TPs to get block information via 0MQ API (switching to S0+T+B->S1)   ></description> </Issue>

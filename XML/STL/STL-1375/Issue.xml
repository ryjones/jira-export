CDATA When posting read request to rest api there is an option to request address prefix and get list of addresses starting with this prefix, this doesn't require the user to know in advance which addresses exist.  would like to get the same option from TP, i.e. something like (depends on which language) map<address, data> = context,get_state(address_prefix);  Also, a lot of times not interested in addresses data, just to know which addresses contain data and which are empty. it would provide a big boost to performance (and allow use of more sophisticated TP logic for addresses) if had an option to read by prefix and and get list of addresses that contain data without the data itself  Â   ></description> </Issue>

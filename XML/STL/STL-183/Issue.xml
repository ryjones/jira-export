CDATA Does the Python libsecp256k1 library use the ludbb version of libsecp256K1 (that’s what it identifies as the homepage), or does it use the bitcoin-core version? Or (since it is just bindings) does it use whatever version happens to be installed on the particular system its running on?  And am I correct that we install the debian package for libsecp256k1?  Its important that python secp256k1 is using the bitcoin-core version of libsecp256k1 and not the ludbb version, because the bitcoin-core version has been tested in the wild and appears well-maintained, while the ludbb has not and appears not.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, there is no way to retrieve logs from a smart contract run in Sabre. With the move to running all smart contracts in Grid to Sabre, we need to provide a way to send logs out of the WASM VM.   This will require investigating how to write a logging backend and how it will work with WASM. The goal at the minimum is this story is to return why a transaction was invalid.     This will cause patch release to Sabre TP and Sabre SDK   ></description> </Issue>

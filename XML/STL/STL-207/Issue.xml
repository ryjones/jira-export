CDATA If all worker thread are waiting on a response from the validator and the validator never sends a response but continues to send requests, the internal work queue will grow indefinitely and no more work will be processed. This could be solved by timing out on: a) handlers that take too long, b) waiting for responses from the validator that take too long, or c) adding a capacity to the internal work queue and denying requests from the validator when it is full.  ></description> </Issue>

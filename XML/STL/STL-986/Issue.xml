CDATA This edge case error occurs where a node's seeds also don’t have the genesis block, and therefore cannot respond to the the HEAD request that is initially made.  Since validators do not broadcast blocks received via a GossipBlockResponse, it will never receive the blocks from its peer even once those peers have received the block.  The suggested fix is that a node with an empty chain should re-request the HEAD block from it’s peers periodically until it has received one.   ></description> </Issue>

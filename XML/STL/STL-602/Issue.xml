CDATA We should consistently use truncated sha512 as the hash function for creating state addresses. There's occasional use of sha256. This does not present a defect as the same amount of bits are used. I understand though, that sha512 is recommended for performance reasons.     Updates to at least this code:  consensus/poet/families/sawtooth_validator_registry/validator_registry/processor/handler.py:106  And this doc:  docs/source/app_developers_guide/address_and_namespace.rst:55  docs/source/app_developers_guide/address_and_namespace.rst:120     Possibly other places.  ></description> </Issue>

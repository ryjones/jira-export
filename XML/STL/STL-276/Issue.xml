CDATA Restrict batch submission to a limited set of signing keys, maintained as on-chain configuration.  A list of public keys will be stored in the config namespace and only batches signed with those public keys will be accepted.  This would allow distributed batch submission permissioning, such that modification to on-chain configuration would modify behavior of all nodes in the network.  This should work in combination with STL-274 and be implemented using the interconnect handler mechanism.  ></description> </Issue>

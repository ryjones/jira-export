I'm new here myself, but my guess is that the problem is the old version of Docker Compose. Compose is up to  version 1.23|https://github.com/docker/compose/releases  now. It looks like there was also a bug in some versions that caused issues with 3.1 yamls.  This StackOverflow conversation|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42139982/version-in-docker-compose-yml-is-unsupported-you-might-be-seeing-this-error  has some more info.  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sandeepsuresh  The first part of docker problem you see is because your current user is not a part of the docker group.  Please add your current user to docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  and then logout and login again.  The second part of the issue suggests there's a network or dns or host server issue: "?: keyserver.ubuntu.com: Host not found gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: Connection timed out"  It could be a temporary issue.  Could you confirm if you consistently see this.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA During Record Creation, a sensor id  and initial Telemetry records should be allowed to be set.     A transaction needs to be added to allow the telementry data to be submitted by the sensor and by other means to the Record. These transactions need to be signed by the current custodian.   A historical list of telemetry data with the timestamps and custodians needs to be kept when the new telemetry data is used.   The Record object needs to be extended to to include a Telemetry member, this will consist of a time ordered list of telemetry objects. A telemetry object consists of timestamp, custodian, sensor_id, telemetry_type  gps, accelerometer, temperture , telemetry data encoded protobuff (type depending on telemetry_type)  The telemetry_data formats are:  location:    \{ "Lat": "41.5508608333",  "Long": "-69.5548148333",  }  Temperature \{ "Value": 8.4 }  Motion \{ "Value": 150 } "Tilt":  \{ "TiltX": -17,  "TiltY": -12 } Shock:  \{ "Acceleration": -85,  "Duration": "0" }  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Extend the Rest API component to provide State Export Deltas over a WebSocket.   Proposed solution here would be to have the REST API component subscribe to all state delta events.    Any client connecting via a websocket would interact in the following way:    # Send last known block id and address prefixes # Receive State Delta Event  The rest api would manage the filtering, and the catch-up, but the clients should not need to send unregister messages, as this is simply a consequence of the WS closing.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The first step to enforcing on-chain connection authorization is to implement Trust Authorization. This should include the following:  Proto files for TrustAuthorization messages  Validator should expect a ConnectRequest and respond with a ConnectionResponse which includes roles available on that endpoint.   Finally, 0ther Validators, TP for all sdk, and the Rest_api should respond with AuthorizationTrustRequest with its expected roles. The validator will respond with AuthorizationTrustResponse  and if accepted with roles allowed.  The network will then function as normal after this point.   ></description> </Issue>

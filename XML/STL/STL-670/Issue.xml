CDATA Currently the Sawtooth REST API defaults to `localhost:8080`, which is common enough that it is likely to conflict with many web services developers may be running. This default should be changed to `localhost:8008`, which is less likely to cause collisions, is still a common HTTP port, and happens to be exactly twice the validator's default port.  This task includes changingÂ _every_ default in sawtooth-core which expects to find the REST API at `localhost:8080`. This will include many CLIs and possible some other components as well.  ></description> </Issue>

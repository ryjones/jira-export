CDATA ZMQ is used internally by the TransactionProcessor to route messages between worker threads and the main send/receive thread. These use the same messaging format as the connection between the processor and the validator. The processor uses the correlation id of messages to route them to the correct worker thread, resulting in an extra deserialization step when routing messages between the validator connection and the worker threads connection. This could be improved by defining a new message format for inter-thread communication, but this has not been done yet for simplicity.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

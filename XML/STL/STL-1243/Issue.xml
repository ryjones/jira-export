CDATA On the SDK API cover page (link below) the python sections are labeled "processor package" and "sawtooth_signing" package, and each has lots of sub-bullets, while the other SDK sections are labeled "Transaction Processor" and "Signing" and have no sub-bullets.  Recommendation is to name sections consistently - it is difficult to tell what the different formats mean, e.g. whether the Python SDK is different from the other two in some important way.   https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/sdks.html   Â   ></description> </Issue>

We have a four node validator network. where Node-3 (zero based) only listed Node-2 and Node-1 using '/peers' endpoint. These occupied 10 slots in the peer list.    # I varied off Node-1 and Node-2 so only Node-0 and Node-3 were running # Submitted Batch to Node-0 with 1 Transaction # Node-0 showed the Transaction processed correctly and state was updated # Node-3 did not show the transaction being delivered and still had not after 2 hrs # Varied Node-1 and Node-2 back online # Within minutes they ran the transaction and state reflected coherence with Node-0 # Node-3 has still not received the transaction     ></body> </Action>

CDATA In the Security section, the following requirement is unmet:  The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access. * The CurveZMQ (server) keys are in source code.  Recommend to remove CurveZMQ keys from source code and create placeholders in configuration file where keys are to be populated.   ></description> </Issue>

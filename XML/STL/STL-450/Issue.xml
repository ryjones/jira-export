CDATA After a transaction is executed, additional “substate” information should be stored about the transaction execution including: * Return Value from the EVM (see below). * Any logs that were produced (see below). * The address of the contract that was created, if applicable. * Any other information that can be stored from:  https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionreceipt   This task should determine what information needs to be stored in the transaction receipts and define how the receipts will be stored so they can be searched and indexed inefficiently.  ></description> </Issue>

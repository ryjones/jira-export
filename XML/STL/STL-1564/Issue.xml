CDATA We could supply some no-op macros if not wasm, so as not to repeat  cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))  statement before every log message. This will also simplify updating smart contracts in the future once we have a logging backend for sabre smart contracts because we will not need to remove the cfg statements.  This will cause a bump to the major version of Sabre TP and Sabre SDK  ></description> </Issue>

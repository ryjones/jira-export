CDATA In preparation for a Sawtooth community transition from JIRA to Github issues, we are reviewing all issues within JIRA. This issue appears to cover features moved to Hyperledger Grid and appears longer applicable due to architectural changes in Hyperledger Grid, and so we are updating its status to invalid. If you believe this is in error, please help our migration efforts and re-open this issue in Github Issues at https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/issues.   ></body> </Action>

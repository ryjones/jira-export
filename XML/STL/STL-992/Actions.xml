CDATA The code from libpoet_bridge can be added to the poet_enclave_sgx, all of the function in libpoet_bridge/poet.cpp can be merged into to their call sites with in the  poet_enclave_sgx nmodule.  * poet.cpp * signup_data.cpp * signup_info.cpp * wait_certificate.cpp * wait_timer.cpp  The goal is to remove the interface function entirely and place their logic at the call sites. In effect removing the libpoet_bridge so layer from the call stack. In addition. the (misplaced) header libpoet_shared/poet.h  should be renamed ( to poet_types.h) and only the data definitions needed to be shared between the poet_enclave_sgx and the enclave should remain in it.   The other modules in libpoet_bridge * base64.cpp base64.h enclave.cpp enclave.h log.cpp log.h ocall.cpp platform_support.h sealed_data.cpp sealed_data.h utils.h  should be integrated into the poet_enclave_sgx directory and build. The windows/linux platform abstraction can safely be removed at this time also.     ></body> </Action>

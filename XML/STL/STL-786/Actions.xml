CDATA The LMDB docs describe the PageFullError as an internal error ( https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/#lmdb.PageFullError)|https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/#lmdb.PageFullError). , so it probably cannot be triggered by any specific Sawtooth actions. Further, LMDB has an overflow mechanism to handle large values (https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/#storage-efficiency-limits). There have been sporadic reports of this error cropping up around database deletes, but current Sawtooth workloads don't do deletes.  In any case, there's isn't enough information here to act on. At a minimum, error logs should be provided, and ideally a copy of the affected database.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA First level analysis: context_manager calls merkle_db_update, internally update() method in MerkleDatabase with both updates and deletions to be done. However if a node is newly getting added because of transaction processor and the node to be deleted is trying to delete the parent which is common to newly getting added node, then crash occurs.   https://github.com/arsulegai/sawtooth-core/tree/jira-1478-validator-crash   Has proposed solution for this issue.

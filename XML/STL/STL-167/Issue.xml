CDATA Building and installing this from source for every provision is inefficient. This dependency should be packaged as a deb like the other dependencies and published to the internal package repo: repo.sawtooth.me/ubuntu/ci  Alternatively, if the version included in the ubuntu distribution we are using can be made to work with this, or an external provider of the package can be identified, one of those options would be preferable.  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/start.en.html  ></description> </Issue>

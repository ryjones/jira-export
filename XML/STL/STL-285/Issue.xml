CDATA I am figuring out the ways how side chains and off chain concepts can be implemented in Sawtooth Lake. Many other blockchain communities have these features. I think implementing this would create a great edge for Sawtooth Lake over the other communities.  I have been going through various articles and papers about these concepts. I have now got a high level understanding on these topics.  I have listed below some of the most interesting links I used for understanding.  1.  https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf   2.  http://lightning.network/docs/   3.  https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf   4.  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791/   5.  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-creating-the-network-1465326903/   6.  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-completing-the-puzzle-and-closing-the-channel-1466178980/   I wish to make further progresses on the same.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~justatad  There was a known error that causes this, but I believe it was fixed. It is working for me, as of yesterday.  Please get the latest code and try again. Make sure that you re-run "build_all"  Hit me up on our Rocket Chat channel if you would like. -Todd   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Todd - Thanks for getting back to me!  I've just grabbed the latest code, rerun "build_all" and am still getting the same ZeroMQ error. Any ideas?  Edit: I'm building within the Vagrant test environment, not directly in OS X.  ></body> </Action>

Are you still having this issue? Please try this if so: Run "vagrant provision" from the tools directory. If that doesn't work, try "vagrant halt" and then "vagrant up". If that doesn't work, destroy the vagrant machine and create a new one (vagrant destroy, then vagrant up).  Sawtooth Lake seems to be working OK for us, so I am thinking it is an environment issue. Best, Todd  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In preparation for a Sawtooth community transition from JIRA to Github issues, we are reviewing all issues within JIRA. This issue appears to be no longer applicable due to architectural changes in the current stable version of Sawtooth (v1.2), and so we are updating its status to invalid. If you believe this is in error, please help our migration efforts and re-open this issue in Github Issues at https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues.   ></body> </Action>

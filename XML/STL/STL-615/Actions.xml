CDATA The counter is held in State object. It should be bound to the SignupData object. Both are passed into the enclave as sealed items.  The validator in turn manages a list of signupdata which must be consistent with forks. That is, it must handle being signed up differently on different forks.  Investigating implications of changing those two classes for the enclave and impacts to the validator's internal state management.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Updated PR to remove state mechanism in enclave code.  Instead create wait timer and wait certificate require the signup data as a parameter.  State is now effectively the signup data passed into the enclave. You can also think of the sealed signup data as an authentication mechanism to get a wait timer and certificate from the enclave.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, if a transaction fails, the REST API reports that the transaction is PENDING.  This is misleading to the end-user.    This should return a response with more information: {code} { "data": { "<batch_id>": { "status": "PENDING|COMMITED|REJECTED", "detail": "<Error message from TP>" | null } } } {code}  The detail is on optional value which, for REJECTED would contain the failure messages returned by the transaction processor.   ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="70904" issue="46370" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="This error suggests that some of the proposal responses received from peers either had different read/write sets or returned different transaction response payloads. This might be because the ledger state accessed by the transaction was different on different peers, or the transaction function implementation might be non-deterministic. TheÂ {{ContractException}} returned should have all the proposal responses attached so you can dig through those to figure out how they are different." created="2020-12-04 10:15:30.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-12-04 10:15:30.0"/>

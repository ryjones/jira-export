CDATA I think that's not possible while downloading the artifacts jenkins use the metadata.xml file for the directory, which should be independent for the projects fabric, gateway-java, cc-java.     This project doesn't have the 1.4 branch but why the version is 1.4.0  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi,  I'm not sure what you are saying is not possible? If it's really not possible to publish several jars with different artifact IDs from different projects using the same group ID (which sounds pretty odd to me), it would be better to use subgroups than completely different group IDs, i.e. * org.hyperledger.fabric.chaincode:fabric-chaincode-java * org.hyperledger.fabric.gateway:fabric-gateway-java * org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk:fabric-sdk-java  ></body> </Action>

CDATA you are suggesting to keep these folders https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/  inside `org/hyperledger/fabric` right. Then the nexus link will be like the below may i know particular reason for this suggestion to keep common groupID  https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric   https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-gateway-java    https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-chaincode-java|https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-gateway-java   There are multiple scripts have to be changed in CI for this change while getting artifacts.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA We would prefer something like sawtooth, which has the following...  !image-2019-07-30-13-03-59-946.png!  i.e. several artifacts under the same group ID. I notice that they don't appear to be using the nexus repository, so perhaps it's just that that's introducing the restriction on one artifact per group ID? The sdk currently uses oss.sonatype.org for snapshots anyway, so perhaps it would be better to move everything there instead. Do you know who has access to that repository?     ></body> </Action>

CDATA For implementation, I suggest the following overload of the identity() method in Gateway.Builder (implemented in GatewayImpl.Builder): {code:java} public Builder identity(Identity identity); {code} Since currently only X509Identity is supported, I think this should be sufficient to allow the Gateway to be connected without the use of a wallet. If/when types are added that require configuration of an accompanying IdentityProvider (such as HsmX509Identity), an additional overload that allows both an Identity and an IdentityProvider to be specified will be required but no need to worry about this now.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi  ~bestbeforetoday , I am planning to implement this as follows: # Override the identity() method in the builder with the instance of Identity as the only parameter # Check for null and return appropriate message in the exception if it is null # Check if the provider for the identity type and return appropriate message in the exception if it is not an X509Identity # Initialize the identity for the builder and return the builder # Write respective tests in GatewayImpl     Please let me know if this approach sounds right. I will assign the ticket and start working accordingly.  ></body> </Action>

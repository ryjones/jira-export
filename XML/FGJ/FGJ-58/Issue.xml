CDATA As an organization that manages its own identities, the ability to create a gateway (using the gateway builder) and to add a user identity (whether as an Identity or as a User) to the builder without the overhead of creating a Wallet is desirable.  The current #identity method requires said wallet.  Something that allows the Identity to be passed directly would be of use.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thanks  ~lesleyannj  and  ~denyeart  , however I don't see a new version of fabric-sdk-java on Maven yet containing an updated level that we could pick up for MQ. The last level I see is  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.2.5  dated Jan 2021, which only has the older netty-codec-http2 version of   4.1.52.Final|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.netty/netty-codec-http2/4.1.52.Final  (or is a new version of fabric-sdk-java due to be released to Maven soon?)  I also have another new Open Source security vulnerability I need to add, is it possible to reopen this Jira issue and add the one below, or would you prefer me to raise a new Jira issue? ie   CVE-2021-29425 - found in commons-io:jar:2.6  Description:  In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like "//../foo", or "\\..\foo", the result would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory, but not further above (thus "limited" path traversal), if the calling code would use the result to construct a path value.  Resolution:  Upgrade to version commons-io:commons-io:2.7 URL: https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-29425 CVE Base Score: 5.3 MEDIUM  FYI  ~ibmmqmet   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We typically close a Jira when a fix is merged, not when the fix is released, but I see your point  ~RaewynM  .  Please open a separate Jira for the new issue.   ~bestbeforetoday    ~andrew-coleman  sounds like we need a fabric-sdk-java v2.2.6 release published once the commons-io is updated.  ></body> </Action>

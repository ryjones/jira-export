CDATA Fabric v2.1.0 is due mid-April, potentially earlier. So before Easter let's have done the following list. We're going to release from master, essentially making it like a release-2.x branch, until we're due an LTS branch, at which point we'd fork a master branch again. * -Ensure we're testing against Fabric v2.1 (should be pulling *2.1*, not *2.1.0*)- * -Update docs, references to v2.0.0 etc- * -Release, usual stuff: release notes, version number change etc-  -*Above covered by Pr #45*- * -Release via maven (?) and tag the commit in github-  * -update fabric-samples to use our 2.1.0 version --  -https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/166-  * -Finally: version bump to 2.1.1-snapshots - PR #47-  ></description> </Issue>

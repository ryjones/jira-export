CDATA  ~RaewynM  It was actually happened as part of a fix for a chaincode-related build failure to satisfy the vulnerability checks currently running in the _main_ branch builds: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/pull/143  So not specifically to address this issue but, since it does solve this, I'll close it out. Thanks for the spot!  ></body> </Action>

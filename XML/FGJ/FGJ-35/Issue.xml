CDATA *As a* client application developer *I want* the default query and commit handlers to work if there are no peers in my client identity's organisation *So that* the initial development experience is as simple as possible and works for all client scenarios  The MSPID_SCOPE_ALL_FOR_TX commit handler and MSPID_SCOPE_SINGLE query handlers fail if the client identity's organisation does not have any peers. Propose adding new default handlers that: * If the client's organisation has peers, behave as the existing defaults; * Otherwise, use all network peers (e.g. NETWORK_SCOPE_ALL_FOR_TX).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA SDKs can pass collection names to the Service Discovery endorsement service, so that service discovery considers peer collection membership and collection level endorsement policy (if set).  The SD endorsement flag "NoPrivateReads" can also be passed to indicate to SD that peers that are not members of the collection can also be considered, e.g. in the case of blind writes which is sometimes used to transfer an asset from one org's collection to another org's collection.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I think there may be similar requirements related to state-based endorsement, where the client may want to specify certain organisations (or a number of peers within those organisations) to endorse a given proposal.  I was thinking of allowing the endorsing peers to be specified on the Transaction object prior to calling submit(). No magic but it at least provides the tools for the client application code to dictate how endorsement is done. What do you think?  ></body> </Action>

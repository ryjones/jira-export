CDATA v2 lifecycle allows a definition to include the {{init-required}} flag, which means that the first transaction to be submitted must pass the {{isInit}} flag.  Can't see a way to do this with the SDKs at the moment, so I think you'd need to turn to the CLIs to get a committed contract started if you'd set the {{init-required}} flag. (Transactions without the flag will fail until one _with_ the flag has been completed). Should we add the ability to do this to the SDKs?  ></description> </Issue>

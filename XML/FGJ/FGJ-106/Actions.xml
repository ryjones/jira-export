CDATA I am not sure what conflict you are seeing. _fabric-gateway-java_ does not reference any netty code directly. Only _fabric-sdk-java_ makes use of netty. So whatever netty version is depended on by the version of _fabric-sdk-java_ that is resolved by Maven should work.  Is it possible that you have a netty dependency in your own project? That would affect the versions of dependencies resolved. It may also be worth clearing your local Maven repository to ensure up-to-date dependencies are being downloaded.  Regardless, please try using the latest version of _fabric-gateway-java_ to see if that works OK for you. If you still encounter issues, could you include a stacktrace for the error so I can see where in the code the problem is occurring?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Based on your error description, I think the linked Jira is reporting the same issue. The other Jira contains much more information to allow the problem to be identified and a fix attempted so I'll close this one as the duplicate so we can track it in the place with the most useful information.  If they turn out to be different issues, feel free to reopen this Jira when you have more information to help diagnose the problem.  ></body> </Action>

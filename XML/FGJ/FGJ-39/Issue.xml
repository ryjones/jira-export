CDATA In the following code {code} 		/** 		 * Get the user's private key 		 * 		 * @return private key. 		 */ 		PrivateKey getPrivateKey();  		/** 		 * Creates an identity suitable for storing in a Wallet. 		 * @param mspId The MSPID associated with the identity 		 * @param certificate The public certificate PEM 		 * @param privateKey The private key 		 * @return the identity 		 */ 		static Identity createIdentity(String mspId, String certificate, PrivateKey privateKey) { 			return new WalletIdentity(mspId, certificate, privateKey); 		} {code} The createIdentity method seems odd to have a String for a cert and an object for a private key. Given Fabric interaction using pem formats for both when importing/exporting and also storing in the MSP structure, I don't think this method makes sense.  This may also apply to the getPrivateKey method as well but not sure but thought I would mention it.  ></description> </Issue>

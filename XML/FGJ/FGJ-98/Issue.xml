CDATA In Hyperledger Fabric, does Java SDK support finding query peers for private data collection (PDC) by utilizing service discovery.  In a channel consisting of 2 orgs (org1 and org2), if I create a PDC for org1 only, only the peers in org1 hold the private data. If in PDC collection profile I specify memberReadOnly=false, it allows org2 users to query org1 peer to read the private data. But this requires the support of service discovery in peers and Fabric Java SDK.  The objective we'd like to accomplish is in client side as org2 user, via Java SDK, when calling chaincode to read the private data, the SDK will automatically connect to org1 peer.  Is there a plan to implement this functionality.  Thank you.  ></description> </Issue>

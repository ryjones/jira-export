CDATA Delivered most of the required changes in this PR:Â  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/pull/27|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/pull/27   Only outstanding piece of work is to remove deprecated use of ChaincodeID in TransactionImpl. This requires a release of fabric-sdk-java that includes FABJ-509, and changing the dependency to use that new version, since the currently released version of fabric-sdk-java does not allow send of transaction proposals when using discovery without ChaincodeID being specified.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Arguably this could be attributed to IBP2 - so may be vendor specific and OOS.  The gateway builder requires network configuration json. It then creates an HFClient and gets the network doing the Network#loadFromConfig...   One can start then pulling networks (channels) and from there Contracts - which give you a view to the chaincode.  At least one implementation of the network configuration json is channel oriented - you get a different configuration per channel - rather than network oriented.  This means that one needs a Gateway per Channel rather than per Network. That's not particularly scalable since the Gateway is already implemented by User and User may be a party to many channels.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA It looks like a dependency resolution issue. Perhaps a difference between Maven (used to build fabric-sdk-java) and Gradle (which you are using). fabric-sdk-java has an explicit dependency on io.netty:netty-codec-http2:4.1.60.Final and that is what I am seeing resolved as a dependency of a Maven project I have built that depends on org.hyperledger.fabric:fabric-gateway-java:2.2.2. Your dependency tree shows io.netty:netty-codec-http2:4.1.51.Final resolved, I guess since that is the version specified by io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.35.0.  The failure actually occurs accessing classes in io.netty:netty-buffer, which is a dependency of io.netty:netty-codec-http2. In my environment I see that resolved as io.netty:netty-buffer:4.1.60.Final whereas yours is io.netty:netty-buffer:4.1.51.Final.  Maven uses the version of the closest dependency to your project in the tree of dependencies, so I expect the fabric-sdk-java dependency version to win, which is what I am seeing using Maven. Gradle seems to be doing something different.  As a short-term fix, you might be able to workaround the issue by adding some explicit dependencies in your project. Longer term I'm going to see if I can either remove some explicit dependencies from fabric-sdk-java, or at least better align the fabric-sdk-java dependencies with the transitive dependencies used by gRPC.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This was helpful, thank you. I just explicitly added a dependency on the latest version of `netty-buffer` and set my mavenBom to use a GRPC version of 1.43.2  {code:groovy} extra "grpcVersion"  = "1.43.2" dependencyManagement { 	imports { 		///... other deps 		mavenBom("io.grpc:grpc-bom:${property("grpcVersion")}") 	} } dependencies { implementation("io.netty:netty-buffer:4.1.76.Final") } {code}   ></body> </Action>

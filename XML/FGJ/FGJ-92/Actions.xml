CDATA The wallet structure you have in a v1.4 format wallet. You are using the v2 SDK which uses a different (simplified) wallet format.  There is a JavaScript utility that can be used to translate old format file system wallets to the new format:  https://github.com/bestbeforetoday/fabric-wallet-migration   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Everyone,  I'm experiencing the exact same problem, could you please bring me more detailed information on how to solve it? Either with the wallet migration or via Java SDK please?.

<Action id="70939" issue="45925" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body=" ~ehuarotop  If you can build/run a simple Node.js script, you can use the sample code in the README for the  fabric-wallet-migration| https://github.com/bestbeforetoday/fabric-wallet-migration   project to create a v2 file-system wallet directory from your existing v1.4 file-system wallet directory. You would need to write a bit of JavaScript that includes the example {{migrateWallet()}} function and also some code that calls {{migrateWallet()}} with the existing (v1.4) and target (v2) wallet directories as arguments." created="2020-12-08 14:24:26.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-12-08 14:24:26.0"/>

CDATA Hi  ~bestbeforetoday , actually yesterday I've managed to use the wallet from java with fabric-gateway-java (version 1.4.5) . Now, I'm trying to reproduce the same code inside spring framework environment, and even I'm using the same code that in the java code, I'm getting the following error:  *java.lang.IllegalStateException: The gateway identity must be set*  As I said, running an standalone java application with the example code runs correctly, and I can submit and evaluate transactions on the blockchain network, but when I'm trying to use it from spring framework the mentioned error appears. Do you any clue about what is possibly happening?  I'll be looking to your reply.  Thank you.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="70943" issue="45925" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body=" ~ehuarotop  it sounds like your standalone environment is using the fabric-gateway-java v1.4 while your Spring framework environment is using fabric-gateway-java v2.x. The on-disk wallet format changed between these versions. It would be possible to write an adapter in Java similar to the Node.js adapter in fabric-wallet-migration, or you can just use fabric-wallet-migration to create a v2.x format copy of an existing v1.4 file-system wallet." created="2020-12-08 15:46:32.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2020-12-08 15:46:32.0"/>

Please check it once again." created="2019-09-19 14:45:38.0" updateauthor="yuriiuhlanov" updated="2019-09-19 14:45:38.0"/>
<Action id="63888" issue="42125" author="bestbeforetoday" type="comment" body="Since the channel shutdown should only be happening when the client application is being shut down, a 3 second delay to allow connections to clean themselves up neatly doesn&apos;t seem like a show stopper to me. We could change the channel shutdown to be a forced shutdown but this doesn&apos;t seem clearly preferable." created="2019-09-19 16:19:23.0" updateauthor="bestbeforetoday" updated="2019-09-19 16:19:23.0"/>

Do you suggest to always keep channels open for each identity that signs transactions in an app?" created="2019-09-24 07:15:26.0" updateauthor="yuriiuhlanov" updated="2019-09-24 07:15:26.0"/>

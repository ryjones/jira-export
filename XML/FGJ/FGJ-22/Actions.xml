CDATA I am not sure why to modify the CI script.. I don't see any information in the description or in the summary.  Observed errors while CI job is trying to publish fabric-gateway-java aritifacts to nexus snapshot url. After debugging the issue, it came to know that the credentials were configured in nexus3 but the CI script is trying to publish jar's to nexus2. With Tim Jhonson help, created credentials in nexus2 and updated the script to publish.  ></body> </Action>

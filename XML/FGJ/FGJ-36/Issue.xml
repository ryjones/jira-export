CDATA In the Node SDK to ensure that unexpected disconnection doesn't occur you would set the following grpc properties (reasonable values also provided) {noformat} "grpcOptions": { "grpc.keepalive_time_ms": 120000, "grpc.http2.min_time_between_pings_ms": 120000, "grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms": 20000, "grpc.http2.max_pings_without_data": 0, "grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls": 1 }, {noformat}  for fabric-gateway java, similar grpc options may be required to ensure connection isn't lost as described here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/#firewalls-load-balancers-network-proxies these properties may need to be set for discovered peers/orderers as well somehow as it won't be enough just to set it on the peer used for channel discovery.  ></description> </Issue>

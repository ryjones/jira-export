CDATA Pasting from chat  ~bestbeforetoday     The Node SDK is implemented differently and only tries to pull events from a single peer at a time. It may be a bit ambitious to try to make such a big change to the Java SDK.   The pool of peers selected for eventing by the Node SDK is limited to the peers in the client's org (unless there are no peers in their org, in which case all network peers are considered). An approach similar to this might be more practical for the Java SDK.   So only peers in the client's org are marked as having the {{PeerRole.EVENT_SOURCEÂ }}role, and that role is not included for peers in other orgs.  So the SDK would still be actively receiving events from multiple peers, but only peers in the client's org.  Just need to consider the case where the client's org does not have any peers, and how to deal with that. A simple option might be to have a configuration flag, but this makes it much easier for clients to get it wrong and be confused why eventing isn't working. Better would be to be able to detect that condition automatically and react appropriatel  ></body> </Action>

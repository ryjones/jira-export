CDATA We have recently pulled in  +fabric-gateway-java+/2.1.1|file:///C:/Users/RaewynMackenzie/AppData/Local/Temp/notes97E53A/%3C!--%20https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric/fabric-gateway-java%20--%3E  into our in development IBM MQ LTS release (due out next month), which has a dependency on the open source packages in  fabric-sdk-java/2.1.1|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0 .  However, we are now getting some new security vulnerability hits in our ASOC Open Source scan.  There is one new issue in the *fabric-gateway-java 2.1.1* package: * *commons-codec 1.6* this is a dependency of *cloudant-client:jar:2.19.0* - however it appears there are no later versions of cloudant-client available ?  There are three new issues in the *fabric-sdk-java 2.1.1* package: * *Log4j 1.2.17* CVE-2019-17571 (score 9.8). ASOC recommends to update to log4j-core:2.0-alpha1  * *log4j-core 1.2.17* CVE-2020-9488 (score 3.7) ASOC recommends to update to log4j-core:2.13.2 * *bcprov-jdk15on.jar* - ASOC scan report says that 1.63 is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17359 (score 7.5) ASOC recommends to upgrade to version org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.64 - however I believe fabric-sdk-java only still uses 1.62 (as you had problems upgrading to 1.64), or can you update to 1.65?  See attached ASOC report with details - look for the open source packages with the following directory path: *mqm/mqbc/prereqs/*  * ^MQv9x (OpenSource)_20200609_17_20_28.pdf *  Note these fixes are required urgently as our final code fix cut off date is next Friday 19th June, thanks  FYI  ~andrew-coleman   ~ibmmqmet   ~mcastle      ></description> </Issue>

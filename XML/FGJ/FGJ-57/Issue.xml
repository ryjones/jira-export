CDATA *As a* client application *I want* to access proposal responses on failure to submit a transaction *So that* I can more effectively diagnose and report failures  Several scenarios should be considered: # *Discovery disabled:* currently bad proposal response messages are logged and, if no successful responses are received, the response messages are included in the exception string returned. # *Discovery enabled:* currently a generic endorsement failure message is returned. The discovery option *inspectResult* should be set to *true* so that response messages are returned from the call to *sendTransactionProposalToEndorsers()*. # *Commit failure:* It would be useful to include proposal responses in the exception thrown as a result of the commit handler receiving an invalid commit event.  ></description> </Issue>

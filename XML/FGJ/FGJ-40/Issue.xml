CDATA I had a connection.json with some missing components. When trying to access the server, there was a failure. It was only by turning on info level logging that I found the problem:  2019-08-14 01:52:15.016 PDT  INFO  NetworkConfig.reconstructChannel: Processing peer peer0.org2.example.com 2019-08-14 01:52:15.017 PDT  INFO  Unable to load channel configuration from connection profile: Error constructing channel mychannel. Peer peer0.org2.example.com not defined in configuration  Â   That message, from GatewayImpl ought to be at least a warning level so I can report it without needing to always have INFO level enabled.  ></description> </Issue>

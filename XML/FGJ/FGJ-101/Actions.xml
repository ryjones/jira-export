CDATA Hi  ~lesleyannj  I meant to say above "Could you please update to the *latest version of grpc-netty to pick up the latest version of guava version 30 or higher"* however I notice that the latest versions of grpc-netty (eg 1.34) do not appear to use guava version 30 or higher. Is there a way you can code to ensure the latest version of guava is used?  This is the current dependency list we pull in: ^fabric-gateway dep tree file.txt   FYI  ~ibmmqmet   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ibmmqmet   ~RaewynM   We don’t want to add a dependency on an unreleased version.    It is suspected that if we add an explicit dependency in our project on guava v30.0 then it will conflict with the grpc-java dependency.   As it is a transitive dependency and not an explicit dependency in our project, any consumer of fabric-sdk-java (or fabric-gateway-java) could do the same in their own project  ></body> </Action>

I see that  https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2020-8908  has a CVSS score of 3.3 so I will see if we need a PSIRT raised to track this issue. In the meantime, we need to keep an eye on when  *grpc-netty* is next updated to use guava 30.0-android (or is there anyway you could ask them to update their dependency?)" created="2021-01-06 15:32:25.0" updateauthor="JIRAUSER20128" updated="2021-01-06 15:32:25.0"/>

CDATA Thanks  ~lesleyannj  . However when I look in  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.2.4  on Maven, it doesn't show those updated dependency versions yet - or are they just not showing in Maven yet for some reason?  And will  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric/fabric-gateway-java/2.2.1  dynamically pick up the new fabric-sdk-java 2.2.4?  Also can you let me know whether you made any other dependency updates other than those listed above? (as I will need to request OSSC legal clearance for these new levels).   ~ibmmqmet  could you please review and pick up the new dependencies with the latest fabric-gateway-java, for our current release, thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA h3. Description Real world environments can have strict limits on connection liveness time. If such limitation exists, usually it is smaller than block creation time. In this case, we can immediately return transaction simulation response, listen to block events and see if our transaction was indeed successfully committed to the ledger.  h3. Problem To achieve behaviour described above, we would like to get easy access to TxID. Because TxID is generated on the client side, it should be easy to access. There is an extremely dirty solution, where we add TxID in response of the chaincode execution.  h3. Deliverables - Provide possibility to client which submits transaction to get access to generated TxID.  h3. Solution Idea Add to Transaction interface {code} String getTxID(); {code}   ></description> </Issue>

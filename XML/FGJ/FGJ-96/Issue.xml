CDATA We are currently using  +fabric-gateway-java+/2.2.0|file:///C:/Users/RaewynMackenzie/AppData/Local/Temp/notes97E53A/%3C!--%20https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric/fabric-gateway-java%20--%3E  in IBM MQ CD release (due out next month), which has a dependency on the open source packages in  fabric-sdk-java/2.2.1|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0 .  However, we have this week had a new security vulnerability hit in our ASOC Open Source scan.  There is one new issues in the *fabric-sdk-java 2.1.1* package: * *httpclient.jar*  4.5.12** CVE:  https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2020-13956 (*score 6.5)*|https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2020-13956   ASOC recommends to upgrade to version org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient:*4.5.13*  In addition there is still this issue: * *bcprov-jdk15on.jar* - ASOC scan report says that 1.63 is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17359 (score 7.5) . ASOC recommends to upgrade to version org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.66 . However fabric-sdk-java still uses 1.62 (which I believe is not vulnerable), due to issues upgrading . Do you have any plans to try upgrading to the latest level 1.66?  See attached ASOC report with details - look for the open source packages with the following directory path: *mqm/mqbc/prereqs/*  * ^MQv9x (OpenSource)_20200609_17_20_28.pdf   ^MQv9x (OpenSource)_20201030_14_43_29.pdf *  Note these fixes are required urgently as our code fix cut off date is today, but we have a couple of weeks where we could pull in stop ship fixes if necessary, thanks.

CDATA Add the following function to the Transaction class: h4. setEndorsingOrganizations(orgs) Set the organizations that should be used for endorsement when this transaction is submitted to the ledger. Peers that are in the organizations will be used for the endorsement. This will override the setEndorsingPeers if previously called. Setting the endorsing organizations will not override discovery, however it will filter the peers provided by discovery to be those in these organizatons. Just as was implemented in the Node.js SDK inÂ https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-1425. It would be very helpful to have in the Java Gateway too when using private data and SBE.  ></description> </Issue>

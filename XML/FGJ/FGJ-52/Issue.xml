CDATA Following from the recent build troubles that have been impacting us recently, we have had an initial session where we have tried to encapsulate current issues and outline possible solutions. Further sessions will involve conversations on everything below, and breaking down larger identified issues.   *As-is Status* Builds - Unreliable (timeouts) - Difficult to determine point of failure (logging issue) - Too long to complete - Zero confidence in build result - Fabric build pulls and runs all sdk tests     SDK (node/java) - e2e test failures obfuscated      *Desired Status* Build - Reliable fast builds     SDK - Common isolated testing - Focused and fast (to complete) tests  ></description> </Issue>

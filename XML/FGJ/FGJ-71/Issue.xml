CDATA We hit an issue with the node-sdk under FABN-1403 where the certificates returned by service discovery didn't contain a new line character and therefore our parsing of them wasn't good enough. This required us to do a release with a new fix out.  We need to confirm whether we're expecting service discovery to return certificates in this format.Â   1) If not, migrate this issue to a fabric one and discuss with appropriate channels -2) If yes, ensure our parsing across sdks is sufficient-  ></description> </Issue>

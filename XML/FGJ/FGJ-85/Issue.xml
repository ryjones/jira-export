CDATA {quote}I see your team have recently created   fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0  on 21st April and  +fabric-gateway-java+/2.1.0|file:///C:/Users/RaewynMackenzie/AppData/Local/Temp/notes97E53A/%3C!--%20https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric/fabric-gateway-java%20--%3E  on 22nd April.  We were planning on pulling in  +fabric-gateway-java+/2.1.0|file:///C:/Users/RaewynMackenzie/AppData/Local/Temp/notes97E53A/%3C!--%20https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric/fabric-gateway-java%20--%3E  to our next MQ LTS release, which has a dependency on the open source packages in  fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0 .  However, I noticed yesterday that the fabric-sdk-java and fabric-gateway-java 2.1.0 levels still have dependencies on some back level open source packages and compile dependencies, some of which we are getting security vulnerability hits on our ASOC scan of the 1.48 versions.  In   fabric-sdk-java|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java/fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0  the two issues I know of so far are:  *  +netty-codec-http2+ 4.1.41.Final|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.netty/netty-codec-http2/4.1.41.Final  - needs to be upgraded to (at least)  +{color:#0000ff}netty-codec-http2{color}+|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.netty/netty-codec-http2  4.1.4.6 or 4.1.49, due to a high CVE score of 9.8 (this may solve the netty-handler dependency vulnerability too) *  snakeyaml 1.25|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/1.25  - needs to be updated to  snakeyaml 1.26|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.yaml/snakeyaml/1.26   There may also be other vulnerabilities in dependencies of fabric-sdk-java & fabric-gateway-java, as we have not been able to scan your latest versions of these yet. If possible could you please security scan and upgrade any other open source pacakages that have security vulnerabilities? {quote} {quote} ** We will need new versions of fabric-sdk-java & fabric-gateway-java by the end of May at the latest, in order to meet our code cut of date for our upcoming MQ LTS release, thanks. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

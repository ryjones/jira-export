CDATA  ~andrew-coleman   ~lesleyannj  - I believe you are taking over coordinating updates to the fabric-gateway and fabric-sdk java packages when  ~heatherp  leaves?  Please note that in addition to the two security vulnerabilities I put in the description, today we ran ASOC Open Source scan against the version of our code containing the latest fabric-sdk-java, and it also had security vulnerability hits on these two pre-reqs: * bcprov-jdk15on.jar - Upgrade to version 1.64 (CVE-2019-17359 - score 7.5) * commons-codec.jar - Upgrade to version commons-codec:commons-codec:1.13  (Note I see commons-codec is no longer used in fabric-sdk-java/2.1.0, but is it still a pre-req for cloudant-client in fabric-gateway-java 2.1.0. So could you please update cloudant-client from 2.18 to 2.19 (which appears to have removed the commons-codec pre-req).  Also there are a number of other open source packages that are not at their latest levels, could you please scan and update some of these as well (at least some of the minor level upgrades).  ></body> </Action>

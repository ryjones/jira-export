CDATA *As a* client developer *I want* to use identities managed by a Hardware Security Module to connect to Fabric *So that* private keys are only held in a Hardware Security Module for security  A prototype of integrating the Gateway with an HSM is found at: * https://github.com/ldesrosi/java-marbles-client  Note that this uses the v1.4 fabric-gateway-java API, which had an old wallet framework. This story should integrate with the new (v2.0) wallet framework, which should make things easier.  HSM support is already present in the Node SDK, and the implementation here should broadly follow the same pattern. An overview of the wallet architecture (including HSM-managed identities) can be found attached to this Jira: * https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABN-1353  User guide for using HSM-managed identities in the Node SDK can be found at: * https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/master/tutorial-wallet.html  So the following are required: * Add an *HsmX509Identity* type and associated *HsmX509IdentityProvider* to manage serialization and connection configuration. * Expose an *IdentityProviderRegistry* on the wallet to allow a configured *HsmX509IdentityProvider* to be added. * Change the GatewayImpl code to use the wallet provider registry to obtain an appropriate identity provider for the selected identity. * Add a scenario test that uses an HSM-managed identity where the private key is stored in SoftHSM.  ></description> </Issue>

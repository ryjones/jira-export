CDATA Hi  ~bestbeforetoday   Two questions here: # In the implementation of IdentityProvider, we’ve got a method for setting the user context which is utilized when we create Gateway. In this method, we first create an enrollment (X509) and use this enrollment for creating an instance of the gateway user. And for creating an enrollment we need the certificate and the private key for the identity. How do we access the private key here considering HSMIdentity will consist of mspId and Certificate? # For exposing an identity registry over the Wallet, I’m planning to use an inner class which will help in accessing and updating the provider registry. Will this be a good approach?  ></body> </Action>

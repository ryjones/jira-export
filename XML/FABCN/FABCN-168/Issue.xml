CDATA This is due to the following issue https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8103  The shim code is told there is more data, but when it requests it not only does it not get any more data, in fact it gets a blank response, not even a zero length array.   This should be fixed in the peer. Defensive code could be placed into the shim to detect this and if the peer response is not fixed, this would have to be implemented.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This occurred with the new Gulp 4.0 version update, and solution is below.  https://codeburst.io/switching-to-gulp-4-0-271ae63530c0 Update gulp tasks to follow newly implemented gulp task definition method  Examples shown above, more tutorials available. Currently with the new update of Gulp 4.0, the old method of defining gulp tasks e.g  gulp.task('test', gulp.series('pretest', () => {}) causes stack traces to be titled <anonymous> rather than <test>. There are some easier done solutions to this, such as taking the function out of gulp.task(), setting values for its displayName, and simply doing gulp.task(functionName). However, this makes the file less coherent. Through exporting as the tutorial at the top shows, it follows the new guidelines for setting gulp.tasks, and simplifies code.   Boilerplate code example here which is linked in the tutorial: https://github.com/jh3y/gulp-boilerplate  ></description> </Issue>

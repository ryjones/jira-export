CDATA Hello; thanks for the suggestion - I can certainly see how it could be beneficial. Initial thoughts are that it might be only applicable in languages where you can pass a function pointer. However not to say it can't be used within node.  Where you seeing this as an alternative to the before/after... i.e. it's before/after XOR around?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello  ~mbwhite Â and thanks for looking into this. {quote}Where you seeing this as an alternative to the before/after... i.e. it's before/after XOR around? {quote} Yes before/after and around should not be combined to achieve the same thing, but they most likely will both used in the same project.  before/after are much easier and more immediate to use, however there are some things that are simply impossible to implement with before/after hooks.  Developer should pick the best one for the job depending on what they need to do, but I wouldn't remove before/after in favour of around, they should all be available for different use-cases. {quote}Initial thoughts are that it might be only applicable in languages where you can pass a function pointer {quote} That is correct, and node is an easy and elegant one. I didn't work with Java in recent years but I'd be surprised if something like this wouldn't be possible. No idea about GO to be honest, but if it really is similar to C++ as I heard, it should definitely be possible.  ></body> </Action>

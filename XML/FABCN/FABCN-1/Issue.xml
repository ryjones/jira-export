CDATA AIM:  To have a Chaincode Container for Node.js chaincode that has production useability characteristics     OBJECTIVES: * To not require internet access to instantiate, npm install is considered non-deterministic for production use. * Should an .npmrc file be required, then this should not form part of the chaincode signature - such that different companies may be permitted their own npm proxy servers. * Chaincode should be able to be written without having to reference the shim code/library     MORE INFORMATION:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11555     ></description> </Issue>

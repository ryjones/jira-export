CDATA Hi Guys,  Recently, I am looking on rich query for ledger db.   Want I am wanted as a chaincode developer or feature implementer of business is like    {code:java} select value from table where key = 'xxx'{code}    I had studied rich query sample with nodejs below:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02/node/marbles_chaincode.js#L343    I had noticed that the query returns me an  iterator  and I have to invoke function {code:java} getAllResults {code} to filter out values from the iterator.  I am able to understand when we do rich query, it is possible to have a value set as returning.   However, I hope when we do rich query, we are able to have a function with behavior below    {code:java} function rich_query(query_string){  return array_data/iterator_data  } {code}  Otherwise, every developer who is going to implements a business scenario on rich query need to copy and paste  getAllResults  in to chaincode by themself.  Ex:  Alice for her company having   getAllResults  in her chaincode A Bob for his company having   getAllResults  in his chaincode B ... Instead of above, why not we have the enhancement for rich query in SDK?  I am beginner to fabric, if anything wrong with this ticket tags, or types please help with a  correct.  Thanks and Regards Sam  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hey  ~awattez  I think this has been resolved - can you confirm you agree? Clicking on your first link in the description shows a package.json with no node version specified. The apis/packages in the master branch of chaincode-node support node 12: *"node": "^12.13.0",*  And the release-1.4 branch supports node 8:  *"node": "^8.9.0",*  So neither have a hardcoded version of node 10. Let me know if you're still stuck  ></body> </Action>

On release-2.0 branch the node 10 version is hardcoded.   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/release-2.0/package.json   { "engines": \{ "node": "10.15.2"}}  fabric-shim 2.0 is not compatible based on node version with 1.4.5 of fabric-client if we have chaincode and client in the same repository.     Is it possible to create a 2.0.1 version with this fix ?  { "engines": \{ "node": "^10.15.2"}}     Regards,     ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've this in the release-2.0 branch, here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/commit/2e8e698fa9579563abe46e8a933689756e34120d  I'm working on updating the 2.0 branch to be *release-2.x* and releasing a v2.1.0 from it very soon, in line with the upcoming fabric v2.1.0 release. Work tracked here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCN-391 So I'm going to close this off, you should be able to get a fix in 2.1.0  ></body> </Action>

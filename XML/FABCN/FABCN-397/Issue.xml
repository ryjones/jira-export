CDATA Chaincodes written using `fabric-shim` 2.0^ cannot query more than 100 assets.   *Reason:* The CommonIterator class is checking the response from the peer for a `has_more` property. However, the property has been renamed to `hasMore`. The result of this is that a `handleQueryStateNext` call is never happening.   The impact of this is that all query results are limited to 100 no matter the actual amount on the State DB.  Have attached screenshots of the problem.  ></description> </Issue>

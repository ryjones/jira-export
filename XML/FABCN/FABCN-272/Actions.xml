The test in JSDK and I bet NSDK have not changed.  Also the JSDK code for installing, instantiating and invoking Node chaincode is identical to Java CC and GO CC  and they're not failing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This looks like an environmental issue. A problem with attempting to perform an npm install on the node chaincode package. It isn't an issue with the chaincode-node package itself. Some of the issues that might cause this are 1. left over failed npm installs in the environment 2. corrupted npm cache 3. a package-lock.json exists Things like the above should not happen in a clean build image container, therefore it will be down to interaction with the npm registry.  There are ways that the build environment can mitigate problems with interacting with an external registry. For example a npm proxy can be setup which caches npm packages but pulls down the required npm package from the official npm registry if it's not in the cache. You then use the local proxy as an npm registry and can guarantee a better QOS through it. Products like JFrog Artifactory can do this and probably nexus too.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Whenever a release is planned, it should be decided whether an upgrade to the node.js runtime for node chaincode containers should be performed. For example the current release planned for the 1.1 preview is Node 8.4 but Node 8.9.1 is available (Which has now gone LTS) and could be a better more secure implementation. For example Composer have found better backward compatibility wrt to using it within our development environment.  ></description> </Issue>

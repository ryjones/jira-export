CDATA  ~rameshthoomu   ~Clayton Sims  (Editting original post as I have seen that 8.9.1 was chosen) I think there needs to be a regular update of the version of node in the container to ensure that the builds get to run against newer versions of node to evaluate against these builds. On Composer our builds are always run against the latest level of node LTS available. Now that this Jira has been marked as done, what's going to drive ensuring the node system is kept upto date or is it always going to have to require someone to raise a jira at an appropriate time ? This jira originally was a request to define a process to ensure keeping node.js current.  ></body> </Action>

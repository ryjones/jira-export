CDATA I am getting the above written error from a smart contract in Node JS I wrote. I did not find any legitimate help elsewhere so I am posting it here. I was wondering whether chaincodes have a problem in async execution inside a function that is called. If this cannot be done inside a function, how to workaround it?   The problem is inside the pullState function that uses other libraries and their Promises to form a final asset to be written to the ledger. The chaincode fails in this line:  {color:#9cdcfe}stub{color}{color:#d4d4d4}.{color}{color:#dcdcaa}putState{color}{color:#d4d4d4}({color}{color:#9cdcfe}status{color}{color:#d4d4d4}.{color}{color:#9cdcfe}key{color}{color:#d4d4d4}, {color}{color:#4ec9b0}Buffer{color}{color:#d4d4d4}.{color}{color:#dcdcaa}from{color}{color:#d4d4d4}({color}{color:#4ec9b0}JSON{color}{color:#d4d4d4}.{color}{color:#dcdcaa}stringify{color}{color:#d4d4d4}({color}{color:#9cdcfe}status{color}{color:#d4d4d4}))){color}  with the error.   I have added the code and package.json file in a .zip archive. Thanks for the help!  ></description> </Issue>

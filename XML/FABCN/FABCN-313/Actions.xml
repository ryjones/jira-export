CDATA Hi Jim, here are the list of shim methods Composer currently calls as promised.  The basic lifecycle type calls {code:java} shim.Start shim.Success shim.Error stub.GetFunctionAndParameters{code} Logging stuff, but not required for functionality {code:java} shim.NewLogger shim.LogLevel {code} Key and State Calls (fundamental to Composer) {code:java} GetStateByPartialCompositeKey CreateCompositeKey GetState PutState DelState {code} Other calls {code:java} GetCreator - Fundamental for our access control GetQueryResult - Required for us to support complex queries SetEvent - Required for us to support emitting events {code}  The last 2 can be bottom of the list for implementing stuff, the Logging isn't important to get up and running but I think all the others are required to do basic Composer  ></body> </Action>

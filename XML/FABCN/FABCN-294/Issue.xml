CDATA Hello,     We are trying to mimic the setup from Ethereum where a contract instantiates another contract and calls other contract instances.  Right now I modeled this by using different structs inside a single chaincode and linking them together via code.  Is this the proper way to approach this? Should we use chaincode to chaincode calling instead and model each entity as a chaincode instance?     Thank you  ></description> </Issue>

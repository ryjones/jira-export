CDATA Although release notes exist, the only way people can find them is to know where in the source code they are. Users of the node chaincode are not likely to try to inspect the source code to find published documentation and they should be easier to find than they currently are. Ideally would be good if these were included in the main fabric release notes well.  This is especially important if breaking changes are to be done in fix releases where users may be using a package reference of "^1.4.0" and inadvertently get broken due to the breaking changes.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In chaincode-node ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/tree/release-2.0 )      in package.json,  |"engines": \{"node": "10.15.2","npm": "^6.4.1"},|     The nodejs version is too restrictive, can it be changed to something like "node": ">10"?, or better remove engineStrict? Does it support nodejs v12?     This is because I am using monorepo nodejs approach. The chaincode development and node-sdk related development are in the same project. If this is too restrictive, the node-sdk is impacted to align to the same/single version "10.15.2". And, "10.15.2" is not LTS.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hey  ~tangross , this has been fixed in the latest commit to release-2.0, here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/commit/78f8cf8c2d51c60c0effdbe82c5ee254c2a1b4e5  I'm in the process of releasing v2.1.0 from the release-2.0 branch (work will be attached to FABCN-391) so you should be able to pick this up when it's out.  We're seeing an issue with builds against node v12.16: FABCN-392, so I'm reluctant to change this branch to an unrestricted node 12 version, as users may run into this issue more.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA AIM:  To have metadata associated with the transaction functions.  OBJECTIVES: * Metadata should support the creation of correctly typed REST APis * To permit more accurate type checking if required * Permit tooling support to have a better view of the contracts  *This epic is to define the specification of the metadata, sub-stories of this should provide the implementation of this in the relevant SDKs, and provide the implementation details of how the Contract specify this. (different languages have different mechanisms for this)*      The GoogleDoc linked above has detailed design and sets this in context      ></description> </Issue>

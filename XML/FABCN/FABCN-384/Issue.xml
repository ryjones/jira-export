CDATA npm is confusing in how shrinkwrap files are handled both on creation and installation.  Whilst the shinkwrap file will include the devDependencies, it will mark them as such.   However, though a npm install --production will not install the devDependencies of the module it is run in, it won't do the same down the tree.  Whether this is correct or not - the CI build can easily prune the devDepenendcies before the npm shrinkwrap... in that case there is no possibility of confusion     ></description> </Issue>

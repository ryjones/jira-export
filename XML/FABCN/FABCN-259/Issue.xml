CDATA I am using high level fabric-contract-api for writing chaincode. I defined Init method with some predefined key values to include in Ledger while instantiating. However this Init method is executing with invoke command      To instantiate the chaincode, I use the following command: ```   peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n blue-coin -l "$CC_RUNTIME_LANGUAGE" -v 1.0 -c '  {"Args": "init" }  ' -P "OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"  {{```}} The {{Args}} property needs to specify the name of the method (i.e., which is {{init}}) so that it will be called during instantiation.  I initially thought that the {{init}} method can be called only during instantiation since the {{init}} method may contain code that will initialize some values in the world state (e.g., set values to zero).  However, I realized that the same {{init}} method can be called beyond initialization by calling the invoke command: ```   {{peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n blue-coin -c '\{"function":"init","Args":  }'}}  ``` If a user can execute the {{init}} command beyond initialization, there is a risk that the values in the world state will be reinitialized to its initial value.  ></description> </Issue>

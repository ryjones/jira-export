CDATA The master branch is missing several tutorials that are in the 1.4 branch however this could also mean that the master branch doesn't have other changes such as code fixes or doc changes so would recommend a check to see what has been missed that needs to be copied from the 1.4 branch to the master branch in preparation for another 2.0.0 release (be it official or another alpha/beta).    ></description> </Issue>

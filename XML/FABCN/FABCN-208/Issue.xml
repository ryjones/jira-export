CDATA The docs for testing chaincode have some errors. We need to update the following docs: - fabric-chaincode-node/README.md - fabric-chaincode-node/docs/tutorials/using-chaincodeinterface.md  1. Peer command location The path of peer command is wrong. “./build/bin/peer” should be “.build/bin/peer”  2. Environment variable and options for peer command Environment variable “FABRIC_CFG_PATH” is required to run peer command. Endorsement policy and channel name are not correct.  3. Test steps when using docker The doc misses 2 steps: - `npm install` is required before running the command `gulp channel-init` to install related packages. - `make peer` is required to use peer command.  4. Typo in the sample of package.json The version of "fabric-shim" is wrong. "unastable" should be “unstable”.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This is for us to provide confidence that our ledger-api typescript definitions are correct. Will probably include an integration test to ensure a javascript smart contract can call the ledger-api successfully  *Note: this is dependent on when the majority of major ledger-api stories (i.e. FABCN-359 to 364) are closed out, when no major changes to the typescript definitions are outstanding.*  ></description> </Issue>

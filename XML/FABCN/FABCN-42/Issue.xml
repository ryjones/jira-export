CDATA From RocketChat #fabric-chaincode-dev channel:  "In the fabric-samples/commercial-paper, the smart contract uses the classes “State” and “Statelist” to handle put/get states - they also build composite keys, serialize/deserialize state, and call the Chaincode Shim. These classes seem useful for many use cases because developers can focus on the business logic. I found some projects using the same classes in Github.   Is there any plan to add these classes as a common library to fabric-contract-api?  ></description> </Issue>

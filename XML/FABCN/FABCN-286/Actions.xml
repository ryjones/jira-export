CDATA In your function did you call  {code} shim.success(...) {code} or {code} shim.error(...) {code} where  {code} const shim = require('fabric-shim'); {code} I think you are getting this error because you didn't call either of these shim methods. Could you add the appropriate call to your function and see if that solves the problem.  ></body> </Action>

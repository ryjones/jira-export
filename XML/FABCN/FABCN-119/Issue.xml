CDATA Currently the typescript definitions are handcrafted which includes the definitions from the fabric protobuf declarations.  This generation of these entries should be automated such that they can pick up any changes to the relevant protobufs (or maybe at least fail the build if they differ, as I don't know how we could automate updating the repo with a new set of typedefs if the protos change).  Couple of thoughts then # fail the build of the entries do not match # gulp protos will provide manual automation to create update the typedefs but will require manual CR creation.      ></description> </Issue>

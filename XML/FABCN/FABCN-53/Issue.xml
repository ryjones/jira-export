CDATA The fabric-shim logs to console. That is pretty much all it does. To do this requires 207 npm packages to be pulled in via log4js most of which will never be used eg `redis`.  Composer has received lots of reports of request timeouts due to the time it takes to build the chaincode container taking longer than the default 5 minutes.  replacing log4js would certainly improve this time on slow network connections as well as address the following warnings  {code:java} npm WARN deprecated nodemailer@2.7.2: All versions below 4.0.1 of Nodemailer are deprecated. See https://nodemailer.com/status/ npm WARN deprecated node-uuid@1.4.8: Use uuid module instead {code}    ></description> </Issue>

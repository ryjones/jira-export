CDATA What's the format of the chaincode source? - chaincode should be written as CommonJS modules and be launch-able with the node.js engine  How does the chaincode get discovered and loaded into the node.js app? - a package.json must accompany is chaincode sources, in the root folder of the "chaincodePath" parameter during chaincode install. The package.json is critically important for two purposes: ## specifies any dependencies, including the fabric-shim package itself which is needed by all JS chaincodes, and any other external dependencies ## using the "scripts" section to specify how the chaincode should be launched: {code} "scripts": { "start": "node mychaincode.js" },{code}  Do we allow JS chaincodes to have other source dependencies? in other words can a JS chaincode by broken up into multiple modules? - yes definitely  How do we ensure multiple install operations produce the same binary from npm install? - use best practices with shrinkwrap.json  ></description> </Issue>

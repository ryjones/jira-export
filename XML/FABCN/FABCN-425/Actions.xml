CDATA As the doc suggests, this is a Protobuf. You either need to use the *google.protobuf.Timestamp* package to convert it to a timestamp object (this is the correct way) or you can do something like: {code:java} const newTimestamp = new Date(timestamp.seconds.low * 1000); {code} Using the second method however frowned upon as it is possible to lose data in the calculation (like timezone adjsuted information) which the protobuf package will account for based on system time.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~btl5037  I found a workaround for this bug myself, I'm using {code:java} (ctx.stub.getTxTimestamp().getSeconds() as unknown as Long).toNumber() {code} which is super ugly.  And what you suggest won't work because you don't have access to seconds from the timestamp object as demonstrated below:  !Screenshot from 2020-07-24 13-19-46-1.png|thumbnail!  The correct way would be to return Timestamp object directly as documentation implies  ></body> </Action>

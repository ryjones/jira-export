CDATA I've tried to recreate the problem but I haven't been able to on builds later than the preview release. However is this is a problem then as indicated by the reporter, the issue could like inside the peer itself rather than the fabric-chaincode-node part.  The fabric-chaincode-node would only return to the caller once it has a response from the peer and it replicates what the go shim would do as well so if this problem occurs in the fabric-chaincode-node then the likelyhood is that it also occurs in go chaincode as well.   ~daanporon  are you able to test against the alpha release to see if the problem still occurs ? if it does then it may be worth tagging it to a different component given that I don't believe the problem lies in the node shim implementation as indicated by your comment.  ></body> </Action>

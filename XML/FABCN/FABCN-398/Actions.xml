CDATA So the ByteBuffer that is coming back is direct from the protobufjs library. It's a protobufjs/bytebuffer  rather than a regular buffer.     I believe that you should be able to use this as it is without issue?     V2.1 - has moved to use UInt8Arrays for everything.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~yuriiuhlanov   have you observed any problems with this difference?  Problems that stop compilation or otherwise.  If this is just a warning/observation of a mismatch but functional things work, we'd prefer to leave this as-is... As in 2.1 the interface is different anyway  ></body> </Action>

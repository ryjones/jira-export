CDATA As getPrivateData and getPrivateDataByRange are invoked something like "�{�Ǎ�����"q�ڵ��ϴ��{�ǈ�鬶+ez�j���ܷ��q����Z� y�)�'j.��u�.��&z��r��zw2Q" is returned when converting the output buffer to a string. This occurs when the data is committed as a string to the ledger instead of a byte buffer. But according to the documentation committing data as a string should be possible.   Three days ago it worked properly and returned the correct value as readable string. Therefore it is my guess that this originates from the most recent update of fabric-shim node library and the current build failure.     Moreover, these methods are currently not documented anymore on  https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeStub.html|https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeStub.html.      ></description> </Issue>

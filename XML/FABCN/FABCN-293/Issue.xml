CDATA Failure to call wither shim.success or shim.error should result in a shim.error being done on behalf of the chaincode with an error to state that neither success or error were called. However the code fails as the shim doesn't get resolved properly when required. This is likely due to circular requires as shim requires chaincode, then chaincode requires shim.  The code to require shim should be removed and the logic for shim.error just copied in.  ></description> </Issue>

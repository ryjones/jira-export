CDATA The Fabric documentation does not include Go SDK details.  The Go Fabric SDK documentation link from the Fabric docs points to https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go under which is where Manish points to.  I can't think of a place to add this other than where it currently resides, but welcome suggestions. Otherwise, I think this can be closed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yep, I've moved it to be under the chaincode project so it's on my radar and I'll take a look with the maintainers next week.  Exact link to function referenced is here:  https://fabric-shim.github.io/release-1.4/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#getStateByPartialCompositeKey__anchor   The comment here doesn't match chaincode-go's that Manish posted earlier, so it's probably worth making sure they match   ~icarrascol - what version of fabric-shim were you using?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Ok, spoke to the chaincode-node maintainers and it sounds like you want the api docs to match what it says in the relevant comment in chaincode-go, i.e. "For a full composite key, an iter with empty response would be returned." I'll update the title to reflect this, please change it if I've got that wrong.   We need to move the location of the api docs before doing this one, so I'll block this Jira behind that change (FABCN-378)  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="66806" issue="43988" author="heatherp" type="comment" body="It&apos;s probably also worth me mentioning that we&apos;re working on a new set of apis under a &quot;ledger-api&quot;, which would help you out in this case.

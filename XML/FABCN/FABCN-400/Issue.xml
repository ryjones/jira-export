CDATA I'm using fabric-contract-api with Typescript and when I put the decorator @Property on properties differents than string or number the smart contract can't instantiate and got this error : "failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: container exited with 1". I have tried with "string  " and "Date" but apparently doesn't work on other types too except string or number.  ></description> </Issue>

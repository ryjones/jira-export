CDATA There are currently multiple separate chaincodes required for testing which are all started individually causing long delays and timeouts during chaincode node fv testing.  These are currently {{fabric-chaincode-node/test/chaincodes}}... invoked from the {{test/fv/*.js}}... each file in the {{fv}}directory is a separate test invoked via {{mocha *.js}}.  as part of the {{@beforeAll}} it installs the required contract  Combining them all into a single chaincode should help  ></description> </Issue>

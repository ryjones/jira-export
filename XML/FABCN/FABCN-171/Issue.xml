CDATA If the write process is frequently performed in a short time, only the final request does not reach the peer.      Fact   For example, when writing 10000 transactions, the chaincode is executed 10000 times in two threads from the client.  Only the last request does not reach the peer.  (This event does not occur when executed in one thread.)     After that, when chaincode is executed by another transaction, the staying data and the current transaction data are broadcast together and taken into Peer.      Expectation   All transactions are successfully logged to the peer.  ></description> </Issue>

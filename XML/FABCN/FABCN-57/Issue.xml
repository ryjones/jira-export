CDATA The {{fabric-sdk-node}} module has TypeScript declarations that make it easy for TypeScript developers to build applications using the Fabric SDK - it provides code completion and validation. This information can also be used by certain editors, such as Visual Studio Code, to provide code completion for JavaScript developers as well.  The {{fabric-chaincode-node}} module does not have TypeScript declarations, which means that whilst TypeScript developers can still write JavaScript chaincode, they cannot benefit from code completion and validation.  We should add a TypeScript declaration file to this module that defines all of the classes and functions exported by the module, to aid TypeScript developers.  I had a first stab at this - here's the steps:  The following line needs to be added into {{package.json}} to register the "typings" file:  {code}"typings": "index.d.ts"{code}  A file named {{index.d.ts}} needs to be created with the TypeScript declarations, here's what I had so far:  {code}/// <reference types="node" />  export interface ChaincodeInterface { Init(stub: Stub): Promise<any>; Invoke(stub: Stub): Promise<any>; }  declare class FunctionAndParameters { fcn: string params: string   }  export class Stub { getArgs(): string  ; getStringArgs(): string  ; getFunctionAndParameters(): FunctionAndParameters; }  export class Shim { static start(chaincode: ChaincodeInterface): any; static success(payload?: Buffer): any; static error(msg?: Buffer): any; }{code}  There's a lot of classes and functions missing from this file, so plenty to do yet ;-)  This file also only works with these changes: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10863 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/23639/  ></description> </Issue>

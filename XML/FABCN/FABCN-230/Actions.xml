CDATA FYI  https://github.com/Southern/node-x509/pull/75   We repushed a community PR71 to get node10 support;  this was merged (Pr74 and published as 0.3.4), but then discovered that the certificates as used in Fabric weren't compatible with the original PR - the error above is seen.     Pull 75 is a correction that both enables Node10 and also fixes the parsing of the certificates - but is yet to be merged..  Until such time, 0.3.3 is the level of x509 that has to be used.      What would be good to get is the command that creates a certificate originally for the that has issue     ></body> </Action>

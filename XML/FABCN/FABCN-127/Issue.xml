CDATA Currently properties of components are not listed as required meaning the validation by AJV does not pick up when the value passed in as a param is missing fields.  E.g. {} is a valid value for any component taken in.  Possible fix: Amend @Property to mark as required by default and include option to mark the property as optional.  Complete implementation of fix for https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15190 prior to implementation of this as would mean having to pass additional properties that aren't really required bu appear to be due to the merging of sibling classes  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently metadata regarding submit/evaluate tags is different in all 4 tested languages.  There are 2 types of differences: # The name of the tag array: in some cases is *tag* (singular) in other is *tags* (plural). # The tag names  I am raising this against the node chaincode because there are 2 languages that need modifying here. Other chaincode languages will also have to be updated but I'll let the teams decide how to track this rather than copy/pasting this defect everywhere.   What does the submit/evaluate metadata look like for contracts written in: * JS: transactions have *tags* array **  'submitTx'  --> submit - this is the only option   * TS: transactions have *tag* array **  'submitTx'  --> submit **    --> evaluate (empty array!!)   * Go: transactions have *tag* array **  'submit'  --> submit **  'evaluate'  --> evaluate   * Java: transactions have *tags* array **  'INVOKE'  --> submit **  'DEFAULT'  --> submit **  'QUERY'  --> evaluate  ></description> </Issue>

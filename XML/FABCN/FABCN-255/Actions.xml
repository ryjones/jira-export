CDATA  ~denyeart  It's an interesting one. The documentation actually states it should be a string, however the example passes in an Error object and I think that is valid. So what appears to be valid are 1. String (need to check to see if there are any limitations on what a string could contain) 2. Buffer 3. Any object that has a toString method which does something sensible, rather than use the default prototype implementation (such as an Error object)  The reason I think Buffer is specified on success but string is on error is that in a success scenario you may want to return binary data whereas in an error message it will always be a string. If I get time today I will just do some quick checks, but in Composer we always did this approach and have had no problems so I am pretty sure the above describes valid scenarios.  ></body> </Action>

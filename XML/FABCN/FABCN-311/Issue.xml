CDATA As the SVT system evolves, tests for the new programming model should be added into the regression test bucket, to investigate system topology change impacts on the new code features.  The fabric network commands remain client side, so the ability to flex these relies upon the manner in which tests are to be run within the SVT system.  The chaincode changes are immediately testable for node chaincode and are anticipated to be made available for goLang chaincode in the future. These can *and should* be invoked within an SVT system to ensure consistent operation irrespective of the base Fabric topology.  Documentation of this feature is available at: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Gateway.html  ></description> </Issue>

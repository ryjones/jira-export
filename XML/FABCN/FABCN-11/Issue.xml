CDATA At the moment if developers want to unit test their node chaincode then they end up having to create their own mocks of the stub and iterator classes.  We should expose the stub and iterator implementations when the fabric-shim is required so that developers can use capabilities such as sinon to generate mock instances of the stub and iterator classes.  ></description> </Issue>

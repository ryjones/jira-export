CDATA Current status is the x509 library has been updated to a forked version that compile with Node 10.  Version 2.0 can drop Node 10 support,  and for v1.4.1, the SDK can certainly be used with Node 10.     Chaincode in v1.4.x with node 10, however, will require changes to the base Docker image to add in Node 10 (in addition to Node 8)  Updates to the platform creation go code in the peer to permit checks to see what the engine setting in package.json is and adjust the node version.  *Such a change appears too complex for a x.x.1 release... therefore* *unless strong reasons why not, or if there's an easier approach. Propose that for v1.4.1 Node 10 is closed.*     /cc  ~simonstone1  for comment  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mbwhite  I guess I don't understand why we would have Node.js 8 and Node.js 10 in the base Docker image - why not just replace 8 with 10? Is there something that's been removed in Node.js 10 that is likely to break a lot of chaincode developers when they instantiate/upgrade chaincode? They won't get automatically moved to Node.js 10 just by upgrading to Fabric 1.4.1. Have we tried the upgrade with various existing chaincode samples?  Node.js 8 goes end of service (currently in maintenance mode) at the end of this year on December 31st, and Fabric 1.4 is LTS until January 10th 2019. Anyone looking to set up a new Node.js environment will automatically be sent to the Node.js 10 downloads, so forcing them to set up Node.js 8 for local development is a bit of a pain. Can Node.js 10 be used to run the shim outside of Docker - have we enabled that now?   My vote would be that we bite the bullet now for Fabric 1.4.1, and hope that the impact on existing Fabric 1.4.0 users is small. Unless you know of something in particular, the release notes for Node.js 10 don't suggest that they've removed anything major, so I'd expect the set of affected users to be pretty small, if not zero.  However since Fabric 2.0 is coming in a few months, and this change is definitely going into Fabric 2.0 - I'm not going to grumble too much if someone else says no.   ~mastersingh24   ~denyeart  on that note - any comments?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA contracts can have pluggable serializers and all returns go via the serializer however if no metadata is present then parameters are converted to strings but not by the serializer.  I would like to suggest that the serializer handles the conversion to strings when no metadata is present and make the handling of parameters go via the serializer. This would allow contracts to implement their own serializer and not have to use metadata.    ></description> </Issue>

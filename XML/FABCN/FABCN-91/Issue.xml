The node.js container could exceed the default memory limit of node (which is about 1.7Gb). It should be possible to specify node options which among other things allows the ability to define the memory configuration of the node.js process running in the chaincode container" priority="2" resolution="10200" status="6" created="2018-10-31 07:29:35.0" updated="2019-11-30 21:14:13.0" resolutiondate="2019-10-09 12:44:52.0" votes="1" watches="2" workflowId="56909"/>

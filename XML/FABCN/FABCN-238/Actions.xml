CDATA To quote from:  As odd as it seems; this is working correctly.  1) The contract is written in JavaScript and there is no additional metadata to describe the types. Therefore contract api needs to make an assumption about return types  2) This assumption is therefore to JSON.stringify(..) what the contract transactional functional returns, before converting it to a buffer to return  3) The contract though itself is returning a string - this is then being double stringified as a consequence.  Fix is to the contract sample     https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14170  ></body> </Action>

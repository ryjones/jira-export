CDATA *As a* smart contract developer *I want* to use the fabcar and commercial paper fabric samples and the ledger-api *So that* I can learn how to use the ledger-api in my smart contract, by example  *Note: this is dependent on when the majority of major ledger-api stories (i.e. FABCN-359 to 364) are closed out.*  We may decide to use a working fabcar sample as a milestone for a beta-release. However, both commercial paper and fabcar should be updated to include using the ledger-api before a proper release.

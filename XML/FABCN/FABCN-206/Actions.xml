CDATA The deprecated warnings are coming from the x509 library that is being used, pulled in as a dependent library - as used to provide APIs for chaincode to get information about a users' certificate.  The java.security.Certificate API has been deprecated since 1.2 and has been superseded by java.security.cert.Certificate and related classes since 1.2. It is no longer necessary.  Please check this ASAP, as all our daily builds have deprecated warnings. {code:java} /22:45:39 In file included from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:26:0, 22:45:39                  from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/node.h:63, 22:45:39                  from ../include/addon.h:4, 22:45:39                  from ../src/addon.cc:4: 22:45:39 /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:3502:36: note: declared here 22:45:39                  MaybeLocal<Object> CloneElementAt(Local<Context> context, 22:45:39                                     ^ 22:45:39 /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8config.h:318:3: note: in definition of macro ‘V8_DEPRECATED’ 22:45:39    declarator __attribute__((deprecated(message))) 22:45:39    ^ 22:45:39 In file included from ../node_modules/nan/nan_new.h:189:0, 22:45:39                  from ../node_modules/nan/nan.h:200, 22:45:39                  from ../include/x509.h:7, 22:45:39                  from ../src/addon.cc:5: 22:45:39 ../node_modules/nan/nan_implementation_12_inl.h: In static member function ‘static Nan::imp::FactoryBase<v8::BooleanObject>::return_t Nan::imp::Factory<v8::BooleanObject>::New(bool)’: 22:45:39 ../node_modules/nan/nan_implementation_12_inl.h:40:38: warning: ‘static v8::Local<v8::Value> v8::BooleanObject::New(bool)’ is deprecated: Pass an isolate  -Wdeprecated-declarations  22:45:39    return v8::BooleanObject::New(value).As<v8::BooleanObject>(); 22:45:39                                       ^ 22:45:39 In file included from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:26:0, 22:45:39                  from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/node.h:63, 22:45:39                  from ../include/addon.h:4, 22:45:39                  from ../src/addon.cc:4: 22:45:39 /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:4793:56: note: declared here 22:45:39    V8_DEPRECATED("Pass an isolate", static Local<Value> New(bool value)); 22:45:39                                                         ^ 22:45:39 /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8config.h:318:3: note: in definition of macro ‘V8_DEPRECATED’ 22:45:39    declarator __attribute__((deprecated(message))) 22:45:39    ^ 22:45:39 In file included from ../include/x509.h:7:0, 22:45:39                  from ../src/addon.cc:5: 22:45:39 ../node_modules/nan/nan.h: In function ‘bool Nan::SetAccessor(v8::Local<v8::Object>, v8::Local<v8::String>, Nan::GetterCallback, Nan::SetterCallback, v8::Local<v8::Value>, v8::AccessControl, v8::PropertyAttribute)’: 22:45:39 ../node_modules/nan/nan.h:1969:16: warning: ‘bool v8::Object::SetAccessor(v8::Local<v8::Name>, v8::AccessorNameGetterCallback, v8::AccessorNameSetterCallback, v8::Local<v8::Value>, v8::AccessControl, v8::PropertyAttribute)’ is deprecated: Use maybe version  -Wdeprecated-declarations  22:45:39      , attribute); 22:45:39                 ^ 22:45:39 In file included from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:26:0, 22:45:39                  from /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/node.h:63, 22:45:39                  from ../include/addon.h:4, 22:45:39                  from ../src/addon.cc:4: 22:45:39 /home/jenkins/.node-gyp/8.9.4/include/node/v8.h:3172:22: note: declared here 22:45:39                  bool SetAccessor(Local<Name> name,/ code placeholder {code} Build log:   https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric-chaincode-node/job/fabric-chaincode-node-verify-x86_64/88/consoleFull  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This issue is dependent on either removing the x509 library and replacing it with another one (that is v2.0 issue due to breaking external changes on format of x509 certificate), or the x509 library being updated.   That is a library we don't have control over.  https://github.com/Southern/node-x509    FYI   The java.security.Certificate API has been deprecated since 1.2 and has been superseded by java.security.cert.Certificate and related classes since 1.2.

CDATA We can't resolve this without either an update to x509 library, (that does not appear to be forthcoming from the moderators of the repo).  Or removing it entirely.  Won't happen for 1.4 sadly.    'Fixed-in-next-release' therefore  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The scenario is where I want to use typescript for compile time checking to define a model which is shared between both the node.js chaincode and the node.js client.  So I have a model.ts file shared between the chaincode and client builds. However to annotate the model.ts file I need to import the contract api, but that pulls in fabric-shim and contract-spi which is ok when building the chaincode side but not appropriate for building the client side.  It should be possible to share typescript model files and have annotations generated chaincode side, but able to ignore client side without having to pull in irrelevant npm models.    ></description> </Issue>

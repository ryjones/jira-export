CDATA For golang chaincode support two container images are involved: - *fabric-ccenv* performs the docker build that does go build and produces the chaincode executable - the resulting executable from above is put into *fabric-baseos* and produces the chaincode docker image  For node.js chaincode support, we re-use the docker build step by performing the "npm install" in fabric-ccenv, to produce the "chaincode executable" which is the folder containing "chaincode.js, package.json and node_modules".  Then for the base of the runtime docker image, we need the equivalent of the fabric-baseos. It should essentially be fabric-baseos + node 8.4 (or later)  For justifications on using node 8, and other discussions, see FAB-5823  Currently the runtime image is built from fabric-baseimage, which has the pre-reqs, but has a lot of extraneous content we don't need  ></description> </Issue>

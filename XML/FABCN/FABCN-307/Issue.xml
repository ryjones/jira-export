CDATA The new programming model provides two new routes to invoke chaincode:   1) Through the `network` command (client side)   2) Through the specification of a function to invoke (chaincode side)  These routes should be performance tested to ensure optimal operation, the removal/alleviation of any bottlenecks attributable to the code flow, and changes in achievable TPS     Network Command (Node-SDK)  The network command requires profiling to investigate potential performance increases and a comparison to the existing (required) code flow for a 'standard' network connection/transaction invocation. At the same time a 'required lines of code' compare will be made to provide insight into the benefits for developers to use the new API to invoke a transaction.     Chaincode (Node)  The changes in the chaincode-node package permit users to directly specify a function within the deployed chaincode to invoke. This modifies the manner in which chaincode is itself invoked and consequently requires performance testing on a 'TPS' level.  A comparison on the maximum TPS for pre and post change should be investigated, through the deployment of a smart contract and invocation of a chaincode function for both levels of chaincode-node on the same level of Fabric images (1.3)         ></description> </Issue>

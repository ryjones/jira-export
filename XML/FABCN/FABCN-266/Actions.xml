CDATA These tests are failing because the tests use the hyperledger/fabric-tools image for running the chaincode in development mode (why, I have no idea). This image has been modified for 2.0.0 to be based upon Alpine and no longer contains Node.js + npm, which is as it should be.  These tests should either use the new hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv image, or they should just run outside of Docker altogether - I think I'd prefer the latter because a developer running their chaincode outside of Docker is a much more realistic development mode use case.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The CLI was container was used as a convenience for executing the commands; it was off the main test execution path especially as the dev mode tests are inherently more synchronous.  Options * Add another slim docker container to the tests with node to represent the developers environment * Run the dev mode chaincode in-line but in a background process.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The Node.js shim (fabric-shim) includes a bunch of interface definitions for the stub that the contract API (fabric-contract-api) depend upon. This is not ideal, as it means that anyone trying to use just the contract API ends up pulling in the shim and all of its native dependencies.  The new programming model was designed such that a contract can be written using just the API, and the shim can be provided at runtime. This will also enable that scenario.  ></description> </Issue>

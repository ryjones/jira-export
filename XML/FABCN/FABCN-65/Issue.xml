CDATA Only so much metadata can be inferred from the code; As a developer I should be able to provide a sidecar file that can be filled out with additional information. (Plain typescript means a typescript developer that hasn't used any annotations or though the files are .ts and compiled, they are in effect Javascript)  For a first implementation, at runtime this information should be *the* version that overrides anything determined by the code.  More sophisticated checking is outside the scope of this story, should the contract go through, say the vsCode package or other validation then the code should be validated against the supplied metadata - errors flagged as appropriate.      *Location*: CouchDB Indexes are within the META-INF directory - so this should be stored in a similar location.   *Format*: The format of this metadata file should match the established Schema.  *Implementation*:  Internal representation of the schema can be different - should that be more efficient.  *Notes on testing:*  Valid invalid formats, check different SDKs to ensure that the file is packaged by all of them  Data is returned correctly and not modified  This is a read on start; so the major performance issue would be any runtime checking of the internal data structures.      ></description> </Issue>

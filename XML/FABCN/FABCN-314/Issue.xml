CDATA node.js chaincode platform should be responsible for the following "build" steps that result in a custom-built image during chaincode instantiation: - using fabric-ccenv, build the chaincode package by running {code}npm install{code} within the user-supplied chaincode source folder, which must contain a package.json along with the chaincode source itself - create a package that contains the entire app folder including the package.json (use-supplied), chaincode JS source files and any other source files (one or more, use-supplied), node_modules folder resulted from the "npm install" step above  The runtime image should be based on fabric-baseimage, which already contains node engine (and npm, but we won't be using that since all dependencies will have been resolved in the build steps and contained in the chaincode package).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I was trying to pass options for the shim via env variables, especially the peer address. What I used to do is passing the argument directly via argv, like {{node ./my-chaincode.js --peer.address grpc://...:7052}}. Setting the {{CORE_PEER_ADDRESS}} has no effect because {{yargs-parser}} parses the environment variable with the key {{peerAddress}}, and not the key {{peer.address}}, used in the code here :  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/master/libraries/fabric-shim/lib/chaincode.js#L105   I didn't went into a full investigation, but looks like that line 105 should read the key {{peer-address}} instead, while keeping {{peer.address}} for compatibility.  ></description> </Issue>

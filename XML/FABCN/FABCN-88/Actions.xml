CDATA Well, I also feel uncomfortable that it looks Southern/node-x509 implicitly depends on node-gyp. It is always a source of build problem for machine with Python3 installed. It could be better if we can have a pure JS alternative one. encharm/x509.js might be one of them but it lacks of maintain  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Agreed; we have been able to change the x509 previously but there is a serviceability issue.   Quote from the dev who looked at it: (which implies it's a 2.0 issue)  >> One of the functions (can’t remember which) returns the cert in the format that module generates, other modules were different formats so changing it out would be a breaking change (also others missed certain fields it returned but had others it missed)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Some thoughts on what we might want to achieve for this # Remove the dependency of core fabric invoking npm install --production inside the builder container. It should invoke some sort of generic command (as defined by the container) and that generic command will handle the requirements to build a chaincode container image. For example it can decide whether to run npm install or not and can also handle taking a .npmrc file stored outside of the chaincode package as this file is organisation dependent. # The image can be preloaded with npm modules as to support inversion of control and reduce the npm install download time as well as avoid common native modules such as grpc/x509 issues.  This could assist with resolving FAB-9530, FAB-9287. FAB-5886 is a duplicate and will be closed.

<Action id="50999" issue="32762" author="davidkel" type="comment" body="As a further requirement, node chaincode containers need to have a deployment way of determining the grpc options to use when communicating with a peer. This isn&apos;t something that should have to be specified by the chaincode package themselves. It is a system setup requirement not the responsibility of chaincode to determine." created="2018-09-23 10:12:27.0" updateauthor="davidkel" updated="2018-09-23 10:12:27.0"/>

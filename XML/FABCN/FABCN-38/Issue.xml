CDATA X509 is a native module so has to be compiled which extends the time taken for a chaincode container image to be built. fabric-shim also includes `jsrsasign` which does a lot of the same function as x509 so one would hope that it should be possible to replace most if not all the required x509 functionality with the native js jsrsasign.  There is one benefit side effect however to including x509 which is that it tests whether native modules compile on the chaincode container without problem (for example of the base image didn't have or changed the version of python for example). So with the removal of x509, e2e tests should be put in place to test the inclusion of a native module  ></description> </Issue>

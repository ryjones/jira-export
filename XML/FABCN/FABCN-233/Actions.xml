CDATA  ~caroline-church   Today, if nothing is given, then the no actual function is run *per se* ... the code just retruns and says 'ok';  no ctual function called *init* is run.      But we can change to say 'if nothing is specified, and there is an 'instantiate' function call it.   If it's not there then do nothing.      Does that seem valuable?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We gave this some more consideration; we would prefer to not implement this feature.  * All the transaction functions are peers of each other; there are not rules that a funciton should have a given name.  * The developer has the flexability as well to split their implementation into different classes ; previously called namespace, but know referred to as contact name.  We can't know ahead of time really what to call * If there's no supplied function on the instantiate call then there is no error.  ></body> </Action>

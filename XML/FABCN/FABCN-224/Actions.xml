CDATA The good news is that "clientidentity should create an instance of the client identity class" genuinely seems to be a timeout. It passes with a longer wait.  Unfortunately there seems to be something odd going on with the crosschaincode tests. They seem to be failing because chaincode2 isn't starting on org2. Kicking it into life with a direct query in the before block looks like it makes the tests pass but that doesn't seem like it should be necessary.     ></body> </Action>

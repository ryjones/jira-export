CDATA Incorrectly created an annotation as follows  {noformat} @Info({ license: 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0', }) {noformat} Which actually isn't valid as the metadata.json it creates is as follows  {noformat} "info": { "license": "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "name": "MyContract", "version": "" } {noformat} Which if placed into metadata.json will be rejected by the validator  So is there a way to validate annotations at compile time as it seems the code assumes that the metadata generated from the annotations is valid.  ></description> </Issue>

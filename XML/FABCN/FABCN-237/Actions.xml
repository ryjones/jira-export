CDATA Possible solutions:  Once would be to implement some more checking within the annotations themselves; the other would be to do a validation of the schema as a whole after the data from the annotations had been processed.  Currently would favor the former; as fail as early as possible, but also it means that if the annotations package was taken by itself; then it contains the schema as well.  Each annotation (see fabric-contract-api/annotations) therefore when processing the data would need to validate against the specific part of the schema. As elements of JSON schema are themselves schemas this is perfectly reasonable to do. A lot of the annotations use a utility function to form up the data.

CDATA For reference the JSDocs are published for the node chaincode as follows:    * docs are built using gulp/JSDoc - and are generated as static html files  (docs/gen directory) * for publishing (on the merge builds) the fabric-shim.github.io repo is cloned * locally all the contents are deleted * html code copied over * changes are added and then committed, and pushed     Looking at the main docs a format of   <rooturl>/<language>/master/....  <rooturl>/<language>/latest/....  <rooturl>/<language>/release1.2/....  <rooturl>/<language>/release1.3/....  Assuming that JSDoc would be not translated, the language could be dropped but worth keeping the other syntax.  A key factor is needing to be able to know what the current build version is, and is this the latest or not.    Important to note that if the same repo is going to be used for all versions - any version that might currently run a build and would delete the REPO should be modified first.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA Migration of existing links is the hardest part;   A solution based off the idea of SPA routing could be workable here (see https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages and the discussion in  https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/408)    This could be used to make it possible to have easy redirect of any existing URL.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Also note there is a link from the fabric docs to https://fabric-shim.github.io/ChaincodeInterface.html. This is in 1.1, 1.2, latest and master which is going to be a right pain. We will have to go back and fix the previous docs.  Currently this link is broken.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've submitted   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/26222   * Each release will push it's into a subdirectory called after the GERRIT_BRANCH variable, eg master, release-1.2 etc. * Only the MASTER branch build will have control over the files in the root of the docs repo ** this will be the index.html and 404.html files * Within the package.json there is a property that defines the version that is the *latest version* ** The root index.html will redirect to that version.  ** If the 404 page is triggered, the following logic applies *** If the page is in a predefined list (i.e. the page names in previous versions) a redirect to the latest documentation with the `fabric-shim` prefix..  will take place.   *** Otherwise a general redirect is triggered to the index page of the latest docs.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The build has completed ok;  This is currently set that all the master branch will build and only the DOCS for the master branch will be available. When 1.3 is cut; then 1.3 set of the docs will be created. At that point  1) we will need to update the latest tag in the package.json  2) Create a new Jira to investigate how the API docs can be updated to provide a drop down style of choice like the read-the-docs.  ></body> </Action>

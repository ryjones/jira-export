CDATA Whenever a merge of master is done, the docs published at   https://fabric-shim.github.io/   are published. This is a problem as it will include information about unreleased capabilities. Ideally a user of this site should be able to get release specific information ie 1.1, 1.2 and as well as master, but it should default to the latest released level of fabric.     Will be removing the fabric contract apis as well.   ></description> </Issue>

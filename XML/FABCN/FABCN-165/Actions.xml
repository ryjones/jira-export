CDATA I would prefer that the type of an object is not checked to see if it matches the name defined in the metadata. To do so properly would require checking the inheritance model that might exist. I would much prefer to work with an object type of my choosing that conforms to the specification of what is returned. It would be good to have 2 types of check however 1. strict where the properties exist and no extra properties exist 2. non-strict where the properties exist but other properties can also exist. This would allow to handle objects that my be subclasses of the type but can still be passed or returned from the function.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA If I as a user define an object in my metadata of Asset using the @Object notation I would expect data passed in to a transaction function which takes this type as a parameter to be of this type and not just an object with its properties as fields.  Â   Possible resolutions: * Store the target of the component tag and call its constructor when handling parameters. Downside those who manually specify metadata would still not have correct type sent. * Create a components array like we have contracts array called on startup which takes the components to be used. Can then call constructor on these when needed. * Combination of the above where user can specify the array but if they use @Object annotation those are used in place of the array. May confuse as no @Contract to replace the contract array.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA With the unit test coverage hitting 100%, we have opened the ability to remove e2e tests without dropping code coverage. This needs to be addressed as we need to be able to safeguard against the accidental disabling of tests with an errant `.only` being left in and missed by a reviewer.  The most effective way to do this would be to run the unit and e2e tests separately within the build, with their own code coverage limits.  ></description> </Issue>

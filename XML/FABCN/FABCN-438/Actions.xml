CDATA Shebang problems in fabric-node-chaincode were caused not by rewire but by importing a node file which has a Shebang declaration not in the beginning of a file (e.g.  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/653c61589a08e8ddc2a22b7a8705dac721849025/libraries/fabric-shim/test/unit/cli.js#L50).|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/blob/653c61589a08e8ddc2a22b7a8705dac721849025/libraries/fabric-shim/test/unit/cli.js#L50)   This issue has been solved by removing the shebang when code is being tested and adding it back after that.  ></body> </Action>

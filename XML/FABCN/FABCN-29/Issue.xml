CDATA Based on the information available within a pure Javascript Smart Contract, fill out the metadata structure as established as much as possible.   This will be limited to names of functions, and contract names; but will represent the basic-fallback data. That should be handled gracefully.      If developer has written in Typescript; but without using any annotations, just types, the basic information that is now available should be filled in.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a Contract(s) are deployed in a chaincode container, the metadata can be extracted from the src by introspection. This can be retrieved by issuing a transaction.  The metadata can be supplemented by giving the metadata in the form of a file.   To make it easier to write this file, it would be helpful to have a command to export the metadata, without starting the chaincode.   The command `fabric-chaincode-node` with argument `start` starts the chaincode today.   This story is to add * command metadata that can be used to create this metadata * `fabric-chaincode-node metadata` should take arguments for creating metadata from the contract * With options to send it to a file or if not set to stdout  Tasks:  Create a new yargs command module, and set the options for ```–generate``` and ```–file <filename>```  Invoke the meta data generation, as per the code today, but not start the chaincode (do not read from any file in this case).     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Sets an instance of a logger used by the consuming application. This is useful because an application would likely want to use a common logger for all parts of the code. And typically an IT organization would have log scraping set up for monitoring and analytics purposes, such that a “standard” log format is desirable. The SDK should have a built-in logger so that developers get logging by default. But it MUST allow an external logger to be set with a standard set of logging APIs  :param logger: an external logging utility that implements a standard interface.  :return: None  ></description> </Issue>

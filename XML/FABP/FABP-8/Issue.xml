CDATA According to the spec, the user context in Client class should be a user instance, but not a crypto instance. So this is may be a typo which will be a bug. This is fixed.  And again according to the spec, client should set the KeyValue store and this will be a property of client class. So two methods are added to client class.  ></description> </Issue>

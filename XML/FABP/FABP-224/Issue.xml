CDATA There was a script (verify-commit.sh) that performed some basic validation of the last commit message and searched for 'trailing white space'. This script has been failing for a number of months but due to bugs in the script the errors were ignored by the build. The initial idea was to fix the script but 'tox' & 'coala' provide a much more sophisticated solution and it is the standard approach approved/supported by LF. The reason this bug is against FABP is that the vast majority of the changes are in the fabric-sdk-py repo. I will enhance the tox.ini config file (fabric-sdk-py is already utilizing /tox' for pylint) to enable coala.  I will be adding a config file for coala (.coala). I will be enabling four checks: GitCommit, YAML, ShellCheck & JSON. Enabling these checks will require minor changes to existing scripts. The vast majority of changes are limited to whitespace. I tuned to coala config to minimize the number of files that need to be fixed. The fabric-sdk-py team can decide if they want further tune the coala configuration.  One of the big wins for tox is that it can be run from the desktop on a fabric-sdk-py repo.  ></description> </Issue>

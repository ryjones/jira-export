CDATA These notifications exists already and are better managed via Gerrit.   Under Settings->Watched Projects-> (Add project "fabric-sdk-py").      Gerrit notifications are better to avoid spam to all users. Anyone wanting to track these notifications can add the wanted projects into their own settings.   Gerrit also offers an "Only if" value that can narrow the notifications to just certain cases.   ></body> </Action>

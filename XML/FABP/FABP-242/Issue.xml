CDATA There is currently an issue when creating the tar.gz archive for the chaincode with same data. The hash of two archives created with same data will be different due to the gzip protocol and its implementation in the python library:  http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/formats/gzip.html   https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/tarfile.py#L420   Unfortunately it will trigger chaincode fingerprint data mismatch when querying from peers with not the same chaincode. This issue can be solved by directly using the `packaged_cc` in the `chaincode_install` method but this is not ideal.  Furthermore, some info need to be reset on the compressed files as described here:   https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7065?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel&showAll=true  And in the code:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.4/core/container/util/writer.go#L208      We should update the python code for fixing this issue.     ></description> </Issue>

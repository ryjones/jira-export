CDATA Coverage testing tmporary files when failed need be removed in "make clean";  Existing testing process can be refined further, eg, no need to show the combined coverage testing result to developers, no need to erase previous coverage result file ".coverage" manually because pytest-cov will do it, and Makefile can be refined too.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Throughout the SDK there is inconsistent formatting of docstrings and ambiguous type requirements and formatting of input functions and output objects. This task has been created to implement  Google Docstring Styles| http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html   and  PEP 484|  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/   type hinting notations.  These documentation gaps require end users to perform additional "testing" of typing due to ambiguous specifications within both the code and documentation. This task will lower the learning curve required for new end users of the SDK and expand its usability to Python developers.  ></description> </Issue>

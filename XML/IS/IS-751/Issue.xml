CDATA Periodically we receive error 304 when running tests against libindy and libnullpay (using version 129b813d6b247a14b869759bdfe56ad15b2fabbc).  It happens for random transactions and we're not sure what causes it.  This only happens 10% of the time.  I'm attaching a log file that captures the error.  In our test we create a pool, wallet, set fees and mint some tokens, then we proceed to write a schema to the ledger.  This is using a docker instance created from the "ci" directory in indy-sdk.  Please let me know if we are doing something incorrect in our usage of libindy and libnullpay.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-cli                   1.6.6~769 indy-node                  1.6.623  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Create Docker pool with 4 nodes 2. Connect to pool and rotate default Trustee key many times 3. run traffic_shaper.sh with default latencies 4. try to rotate key few times 5. try to send NYM  *Expected results:* CLI guarantees consistency between keys in ledger and in local storage  *Actual results:* Pool successfully ordered rotate-key txn when 2 from 4 nodes have network delays, but CLI resolves "timeout" and isn't applies change  *Additional Tests to Validate:* 1) run "rotate" without fees 2) set fees 3) run "rotate" without fees (wrong payment source) 4) run "rotate" without fees (insufficient funds) 5) run "rotate" without fees (too much funds) 6) run "rotate" with fees (correct case)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To solve this we need to implement "resume" mode for rotate-key command. Corresponded ticket is here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1036  We can close this bug in favor of story https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1036  ></body> </Action>

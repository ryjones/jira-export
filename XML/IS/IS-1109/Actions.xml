CDATA I tried to reproduce it locally without any success. Seems it some platform specific issue related to dll unloading that isn't used in production environment. We can't get any valuable traces on CI and can't use debugger.  Possible workarounds: * Remove these 2 tests from windows CI (already done) * Check during acceptance (already done) * Make test as dedicated executable and avoid unloading  For the moment i suggest to mark it as low. May be we will get new information.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Story* As a network administrator using indy-cli to automate administration, I will call Indy CLI in "batch mode" and perform potentially dangerous actions that will prompt a warning requiring user acknowledgement. I want to be able to use a flag that tells indy-cli to always accept a "yes" when acknowledgement is required in this mode.  *Acceptance Criteria* * A flag exists that similar to "-y" * When the flag is provided at the time indy-cli is called, any operation which would normally require user acknowledgement of "yes or no" proceeds as if the user entered "yes". * A message is printed to the logs and console that is similar to "Proceeding with response of 'yes' because of '-y' flag."  *Note* * As an example, see the Apt tool for Debian.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA * Libindy-1.8.1 * Python 3.6  ></environment> <description><! CDATA Hey Guys,  We're working on a custom Python SDK (based on the python wrapper inside the Indy SDK repository) for Indy. While working on Ledger and Anoncreds implementation, we discovered that it is possible to create schemas, credential definitions and revocation registries using DIDs that are not stored inside the creator's wallet. It was even possible to use forged DIDs (e.g. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA") that have not been generated by libindyÂ at all. We could publish them as well, as long as the transaction signing key was stored in the wallet.  Is this a bug/oversight or was the DID validity check left out on purpose?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~esplinr  - This issue isn't a high priority (probably medium). However, without access to the sdkMessage (private data member), Indy SDK users must use a visual debugger to get access to it when performing root-cause analysis, which likely means that Technical Enablement / Operations will have to escalate to Engineering. The getMessage result "A value being processed is not valid" is not sufficient to reveal root cause, but the getSdkMessage result "Error: Invalid Structure\n Caused by: Invalid combination of params: 'text' and 'version' should be passed or skipped together" would be sufficient.  ></body> </Action>

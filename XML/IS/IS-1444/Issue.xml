CDATA For users of Indy SDK, private data member sdkMessage is needed in order to log sufficient details about the exception. The message returned by Throwable.getMessage is too generic.  !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!   There is no public member function provided to get the sdkMessage. The closest is private member function setSdkMessage, which is returning sdkMessage instead of setting it as the function name would suggest.  !image-2019-12-09-14-45-25-451.png|thumbnail!   I recommend changing setSdkMessage to getSdkMessage and making it public.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I would be nice libindy provided a sufficiently complete mock network that can easily be used in tests downstream from indy SDK.  Ideally, it should be able to: * Should initializable in a consistent manner to how a network is connected to now. * Should be complete enough to allow the full API to work when using it. * Should have similar functionality (without the complexity of consensus of the node), for example, it should be able to add and get standard TXN.  * Should be useable for all wrappers     ></description> </Issue>

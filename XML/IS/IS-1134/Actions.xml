CDATA Thanks for the suggestion  ~ignisvulpis .  We agree that this could make it easier to understand the Rust code, but most of the value will be hidden by the C-callable API and wrappers.  We will keep this architectural suggestion in mind as we evolve the architecture, and we would accept a series of pull requests to make this change if someone wanted to do the work.  ></body> </Action>

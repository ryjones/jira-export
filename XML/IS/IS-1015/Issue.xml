I&apos;m concerned since the managed environment doesn&apos;t track the allocated resources there is a risk that under some circumstances, if the free() callback is not called (e.g. if the type was disposed by the managed environment before the callback) then some unmanaged resources may never be freed." priority="3" status="10405" created="2017-07-27 11:08:00.0" updated="2019-03-29 21:04:18.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="50569"/>

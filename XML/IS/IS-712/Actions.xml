In last discussion the author of PR  ~MikeLodder  claims that all libindy tests are passed in his environment, but we got failed tests both on Jenkins and on our local machines.  ~Artemkaaas  find potential reason for some tests, but I highly recommend to wait one more confirmation from Mike and got clear vision why behavior in his env vs our (and Jenkins) is different." created="2018-06-06 13:16:28.0" updateauthor="sergey.minaev" updated="2018-06-06 14:16:56.0"/>

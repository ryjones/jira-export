CDATA We need to make a couple of changes in libindy's Proof Request JSON: 1) Rename UUIDs to 'referents' 2) Rename GE to something more human readable 3) Support multiple Issuer DIDs for each requested proof 4) Support multiple Schemas for each requested proof.  All these items will lead to changes in proof request JSON (items 1) and 2) are just some renaming; items 3) and 4) change the structure of the JSON). We need to be careful to not break the API for someone who already uses it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Also need to be careful about closing wallets - if you open a wallet, then someone else tries to open it (and gets the handle), and then closes it, then it will invalidate the handle of the original opener.   ></body> </Action>

Im feeling that should be on the caller.  They should get an indy error "wallet not open" if its been closed.  Good to keep in mind and make sure.  An alternative is when wallets are cached a count is maintained and close reduces the cached count.  The wallet is only actually closed when the count is 0.  I feel this is over kill and the above will be sufficient.    ></body> </Action>

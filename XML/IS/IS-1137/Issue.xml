CDATA Need to investigate cause.    While writing unit test 'request_handler_process_reply_event_from_consensus_state_works_for_consensus_reached_with_mixed_msgs' (services/pool/request_handler.rs), we found that changing the f parameter to 0 from 1 had no change in outcome of the test.  This was unexpected.  See also:  request_handler_process_reply_event_from_consensus_state_works_for_consensus_reached_with_0_concensus.  This method should behave differently.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the payment api, actually in order to make a payment an input source list with the payment source must be specified.  After a payment, for the subsequent payment operation, the source list changes.  This is a limitation in case of multiple concurrent request since it's mandatory to wait the result of the previous payment before start a new one.  It could be useful on the payment api to provide the source address without the load to calculate the source and the amount of utxo.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I believe that it is a perfectly valid scenario to have multiple agencies pointing at the same Postgres server. For example, I'd like to run a test version, a scaling version and a stable version of our agency at the same time, all pointing to the same postgres cloud server.  To this end, I'd like to be able to specify the database name that will be used by the postgres wallet when it is running as MultiWalletSingleTable. Currently the default name is 'wallet'. I believe that it would make sense for this to be specified on the PostgresConfig object.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As we implement full DID Doc support, a feature I'd like to add is pre-emptive key expiration policiesâ€“basically, inform the other party that keys in the DID Doc should be considered expired unless a rotation occurs before a certain date.  This has security benefits, because if an attacker is struggling for control of a sovereign domain with the owner, and neither can fully take over, the attacker is eventually locked out.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As a steward of an Indy network, I want transaction authors to agree that the information they submit to the ledger meets the requirements outlined by ledger governance for the current transaction to minimize the liability that stewards accept when storing the data on an immutable ledger.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Before submitting a write to the public ledger, transaction authors must accept the author agreement. * The author agreement is found on the destination ledger and is the most recent one for the current transaction type. * A digital signature indicating the acceptance of the author agreement is included as part of the transaction signature. * The transaction also records the time and date when the agreement was accepted. * The transaction records an indication of how it was accepted pulled from a list of valid mechanisms that is stored on the ledger. * API calls exist for pulling the list of valid mechanisms from the ledger. * API calls exist for downstream applications to expose the agreement in an acceptable way to users receive their consent. * An API call  exists for pulling the hash of the agreement so that downstream applications can detect when the agreement changes.  ></description> </Issue>

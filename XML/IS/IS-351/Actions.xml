CDATA I checked https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/commit/679a61d1a858aff2f8c1d4a6468ce3690abb518b and looks like this commit contains only changes to .Net wrapper and can't cause any changes in libindy.   Can it be related to some changes in your environment? CI performs builds for each commit on all supported platforms and these tests are green.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It is not related to the commit 679a61d as such, but the 80 of 88 anoncreds tests have failed going back for a couple of weeks, at least on Ubuntu 16.04.  I will hose everything down and rebuild from scratch, first thing tomorrow. If the CI tests pass, that surely points to some problem with my environment.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sklump   I analyzed the logs and was able to reproduce the problem on my side. The problem is caused by a timeout that tests used to waiting for anoncreds calls. Could you change the file tests/utils/anoncreds.rs by replacing all strings "TimeoutUtils::short_timeout()" with "TimeoutUtils::medium_timeout()" and check that it fixes tests for you?      ></body> </Action>

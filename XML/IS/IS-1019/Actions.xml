CDATA  ~ignisvulpis   ~esplinr    When we write 0.10.12 it means that major.minor version should be fixed and patch version can be increased with cargo update.   We use lock file that locks exact versions, but consider cargo update to be regular procedure to get all available patches.  Allowing minor versions to be updated looks much more dangerous procedure and requires analysis of each crate. A lot of crates don't have strong release process. can avoid some SemVer rules and introduce security issues.  In my vision such updates are better to perform manually. We discussed this inside of core team and suggest to keep current process with fixing minor version.   ></body> </Action>

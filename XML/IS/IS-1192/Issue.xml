CDATA *Story* Aries is producing a protocol test suite that will be used to verify compatibility across all agents. LibVCX needs to pass this test suite for the core messages we want to support at this time (connecting, holding, proving). This will give us confidence that a message family will work work appropriately on all the platforms that are supported.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Review the current Aries protocol test suite. * Plan improvements required in the test suite. * Review the plan with an architect. * Create the necessary tickets.  *Notes* * Previous analysis in IS-946. * In the future, we will evaluate whether we need automated testing of protocols included in LibVCX.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA From  Aries RFC 0008: Message ID and Threading|https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/64e5e55c123b2efaf38f4b0911a71a1c40a7f29d/concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading#thread-id-thid : {quote}The Thread ID is the Message ID (@id) of the first message in the thread. The first message may or may not declare the ~thread attribute block; it does not, but carries an implicit thid of its own @id. {quote} LibVCX seems to pull the Thread ID from the Message ID even when the `~thread` decorator block is present.  *Notes* * The Aries Interop Test Suite should also be extended with a test for this behavior.  ></description> </Issue>

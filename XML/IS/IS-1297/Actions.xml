CDATA This issue tracker is used by contributing teams to organize development, and so is not the right place for support requests. Stack Overflow (with tag #hyperledger-indy) is a better place. Alternatively, you can hire an Indy expert to help you find an answer.  If the documentation is not adequate, you can open an issue asking for it to be improved. Once you learn the answer to your question, we encourage you to submit a pull request improving the documentation.  Regarding your question, it is not intended for one to be able to undo a revocation. If an issuer is not happy that a credential has been revoked, it can always be reissued. There might be a way to reverse a revocation by republishing the previous tales file and updating the accumulator to an earlier value, but the feature was not designed with this in mind.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello,  ~ignisvulpis   What do you mean by `Indy support is an optional feature of the app`?  You can get a runtime exception only after calling any Indy function. Otherwise, your app should work. I wrote a sample to confirm it.Â  So, if indy is an optional library there are should not be problems.  We can't force calling `init()` function because it is a breaking change and anyway runtime exception still must be handled.  I think we can delete catching of UnsatisfiedLinkError from the static block if it will be clearer.  ></body> </Action>

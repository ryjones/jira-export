CDATA *Story* As a developer using indy-sdk, I need to be able to track the history of libvcx including before it was contributed to Hyperledger by Evernym so that I understand how decisions were made and what additional work is needed.  *Acceptance Criteria* Migrate from the internal Evernym EN project to the Hyperledger JIRA Indy SDK project the following types of issues: * Open issues * Key historical issues containing important information project architecture. * Key historical issues containing reasons why actions were not taken.  *Notes* * We can apply a "ToIndy" label to issues that we identify for migration, and then bulk export them as a CSV. * We are concerned about exporting the entire project without reviewing each issue and history for public consumption. * We are concerned about the difficulty of moving issues between Jira instances with different configurations. * Issues that have a specific label can be bulk exported from Jira as a CSV and imported into a different instance. See:  https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/importing-data-from-csv-776636762.html  * Many of the issues are low value to migrate due to minimal information being included.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In the node.js libindy wrapper, parseGetCredDefResponse (getCredDefResponse ) isn't adequately documented. For example what do the values n, s, r, rctxt and z represent? Also what do the digits for each attribute represent - e.g age:“641...’?  Goal:  To get the necessary credential definition data from the ledger that would be needed to verify a proof relating to the credential definition.  Concerns: * Single letter variable names, with no comment explaining their purpose * No link to more information  Notes: * The variable names come from this paper:  https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf  * Validation is documented in this HIPE:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/c761c583b1e01c1e9d3ceda2b03b35336fdc8cc1/text/anoncreds-protocol/README.md   Action items: * A comment should be added that links to the HIPE and paper. * A comment should be added to briefly describe each variable that does not have a descriptive names. * If a higher level function is recommended for most purposes, there should be a comment that explains that. * Issues are created to add further documentation if necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

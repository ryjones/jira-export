CDATA We will add to the code a comment similar to this:  {quote} The code below implements the algorithm in this paper: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf And is documented in this HIPE: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/c761c583b1e01c1e9d3ceda2b03b35336fdc8cc1/text/anoncreds-protocol/README.md  In this version of the protocol, the following parameters are used to generate the public key. It is likely to change in future versions.  s: a random quadric residio n: the dimension of the key space (p times q) r:Â each item in a mapping of schema attribute names to random numbers z: an intermediate result of calculation rctxt: "r context" was used in the old version of the paper, but maps to the second item in the map of R (the first item is for the master, the second is for the context)  The output from these functions should not be parsed. {quote}  We'll add comments to the code, but we don't think further documentation about the mathematical primitives are necessary.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I misunderstood where the code that uses these parameters lives. These parameters are not manipulated in Indy, but instead are implemented in Indy-Crypto / Ursa. Further, only the JavaScript wrapper documents these functions in a top-level README.  We will update the API section of the README for the JavaScript wrapper to say:  {quote} These functions wrap the Ursa algorithm as documented in this paper: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/docs/AnonCred.pdf And is documented in this HIPE: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/c761c583b1e01c1e9d3ceda2b03b35336fdc8cc1/text/anoncreds-protocol/README.md  Parameters such as value:primary are complex opaque types that contain data structures internal to Ursa. They should not be parsed and are likely to change in future versions. {quote}  ></body> </Action>

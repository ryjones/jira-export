CDATA When a node in the pool is having trouble responding, users of the network report intermittent delays. We recognize this is due to the timeout from sending the initial request. It is already configurable in libindy.  The default timeout is currently 20 seconds. It should be 5 seconds.  The timeout is defined here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/pool.rs#L71   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA A Rich Schema may use contexts (as namespaces) and reference and/or extend other schemas.  A Mapping object needs to define the order for all the attributes including parent and referenced ones.  So, it makes sense to create a helper method that can resolve a Schema by adding all parent and referenced attributes. Context substitution is not required, but may be convenient as well.  *Acceptance criteria:* - indy-vdr needs to have a helper method to resolve a Rich Schema - it takes a Rich Schema as an input and outputs a resolved Schema containing all the attributes from all parent and referenced Schemas  Note: this helper method looks quite generic, so it may belong to the aries shared library.   ></description> </Issue>

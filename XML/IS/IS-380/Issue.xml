CDATA As Indy SDK user I want to have node CLI as a part of Indy SDK.  This story is a about approach definition. I see 2 main options that we need to consider:  1. Implementation of CLI from scratch as native application. Advantages of this approach is simplified packaging on all platforms, less dependencies, simplified CI pipline and possibility to get good-looking code.  2. Re-use current python based CLI code base (may be with significant refactoring). This approach can be faster and re-use old interfaces, but but we will need more complex packaging and some fight with current CLI code (2 big flat python files in different repos). Also some ideas of SDK can't be mapped directly to current CLI interfaces.  Also important questions to solve on design phase is migration of wallets created by ol CLI and system testing approach.  ></description> </Issue>

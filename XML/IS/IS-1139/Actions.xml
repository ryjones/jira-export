CDATA Dependencies of packages: {code:java} $ apt-cache show libsovtoken | grep -E '^Depends|^Version' | head -n 2 Version: 0.9.6 Depends: libindy(=1.6.8) {code} {code:java} $ apt-cache show libindy | grep -E '^Depends|^Version' | head -n 2 Version: 1.7.0 Depends: libssl1.0.0, libsqlite0, libzmq5 {code} {code:java} $ apt-cache show indy-cli | grep -E '^Depends|^Version' | head -n 2 Version: 1.7.0 Depends: libindy {code} The crux if the issue is that {{apt}} always wants to install whatever is the latest version in the repository. So when it sees that {{libsovtoken}} required the specific version {{1.6.8}} of {{libindy}} but the latest is {{1.7.0}} apt will complain... thus forcing you to specify the explicit version {{1.6.8}} with {{libindy=1.6.8}} as the package name to install.  However... doing that then lets indy-cli 1.7.0 to with libindy 1.6.8 installed.  My recommendation is to not release components to {{stable}} until _*all*_ packages that depend on them have been updated accordingly, and work together. Following this, then {{libsovtoken}} should have been updated to support the new {{1.7.0}} version of {{libindy}} at the same time as {{indy-cli}} and {{libindy}}.  The only way to get it to install with the correct dependencies is an ugly manual installation of packages: {code} apt-get install libindy=1.6.8 indy-cli=1.6.8 libsovtoken {code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We currently require a strict dependency between all components of the system.  We will ensure  this is updated before the next release of the SDK that is intended to be suitable for working with the ledger plugins.  This issue needs to be reported in the issue tracker for the Sovrin Token. https://sovrin.atlassian.net/browse/ST  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-cli 1.8.2~64 rc  Steps to Validate: 1. Install indy-cli on machine with no libindy package or  libindy with inconsistent to indy-cli version. 2. Remove libindy on machine with indy-cli installed.  Actual Results: 1. Indy-cli installation also installs depending libindy version. 2. Libindy removal also removes depending indy-cli version.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Current Indy CLI logging have the following problems: - It allows put logs to stdout/stderr only, but QA much more wants logging to file - It use it's own logger without piping logs from libindy. It just looks as the same logger because logs are written in the same format to stdout/stderr  We need the following: - Indy CLI should use libindy logging API to pipe logs from libindy into logger configured by Indy CLI - Indy CLI should use more flexible logger (log4rs?) that will allow writing logs to rotated file and to stdout/stderr - Indy CLI should provide the way to change logger configuration    Acceptance criteria: - Integration is implemented in TDD approach - Documentation is provided - Manual testing is performed - Dependent teams (Indy Node, QA, Customer) are notified about expected changes  ></description> </Issue>

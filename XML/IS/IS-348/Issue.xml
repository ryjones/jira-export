CDATA When Java-wrapper is currently used in a project we have to specify the location of the binary of indy-sdk  As the path of the binary gets checked in the code, this is causing the problem when a team is developing on different development environments like OSX, Linux and Windows as the extensions of the binary changes accordingly like libindy.dll, libindy.so and libindy.dylib. This should be the responsibility of the wrapper to pick the appropriate binary based on the platform. One way could be binaries are in the jar of wrapper add appropriate one is picked when the java wrapper is initialized  ></description> </Issue>

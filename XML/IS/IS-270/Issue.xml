CDATA As Indy SDK user i should be able to easy create and send Update transaction to config ledger.   RocketChat thread: mgbailey16:57 I need a python script that 1) retrieves the verkeys of the nodes in the validator pool, and 2) posts a transaction in the config ledger to upgrade the software version on the pool. Is this possible with the sdk? Are there example scripts around that I can learn basics from?    {quote}2) posts a transaction in the config ledger to upgrade the software version on the pool.{quote} There is no builder helper for Upgrade transaction in indy sdk now, but it should be possible to create json message for this transaction manually and send it with indy_sign_and_submit_request call. We don't have an exact example of this transaction sending, but you can check how to send transactions to ledger with python here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/tests/demo/test_ledger.py   ></description> </Issue>

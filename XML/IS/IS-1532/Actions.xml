CDATA The BBS+ signatures as currently implemented in Ursa are not defined according to the roles of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, but the API is at a rather lower level.     To do this correctly, the first step should be to introduce that framing, and then a demo that uses that framing would actually be beneficial.   I will work with Mike Lodder to implement the framing around BBS+ signatures and then write the demo code.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Story* As a developer extending LibIndy, I want to be able to insert my own helper API functions for a new protocol message family by using an existing protocol message family definition, modifying the implementation, and recompiling LibIndy. This will make it easy for me to make my protocol message family definition available to other users of the Indy ecosystem regardless of the language their agent is written in (through the C-callable API).  *Acceptance Criteria* A MarkDown document exists in the SDK design doc folder that describes the architecture LibIndy will need to support for message protocols (message families and state machines). The document must contain the pros / cons of this approach, and other approaches we considered.  *Notes* * It is expected that the protocol message family will consist of a set of APIs exposed through the C-callable interface. The API implementation will encode the messages in the family, and the transitions between them. * Business logic is expected to exist in the agent, and not in LibIndy.  ></description> </Issue>

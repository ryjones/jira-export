CDATA I haven't managed to reproduce the issue on the local pool.  ~lbendixsen  Could you try to use fresh versions of CLI/Indy-Pool? And share Indy-SDK logs, please.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is working great now with CLI version 1.11.0 and Sovrin version 1.1.52(indy-node 1.9.1) on BuilderNet. What was done to fix this?  In case you are also still curious about the original issue, I will attach CLI logs which start on the date I entered this ticket (not sure if thats what you meant by sdk logs...).  ></body> </Action>

The following happened on the pool: * NodeA received a request with keys rotation, sent Propagate messages * The primary node sent Pre-prepare and all nodes changed their uncommitted state. * All nodes received the request, but could not validate it, since it was signed with old keys, which are not correct for the uncommitted state anymore. Therefore, with static validation, all nodes answered the REQNACK message.  This problem did not reproduce on the latest versions, as it was fixed in the scope of the task https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-2164  ></body> </Action>

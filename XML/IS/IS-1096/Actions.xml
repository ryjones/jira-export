The issue uses a workspace which isn&apos;t checked into the repo.  So I cannot create the problem using the command above.  It sounds like  ~MichaelWang  created a new project consuming Indy-sdk.

CDATA This has turned into more work than we expected. We are seeing multiple problems with this wrapper, but we aren't able to reproduce what  ~MichaelWang  is seeing.  We are going to need to put this task aside for a month and work on completing the agent compatibility work for the Sovrin connect-all-the-agents-a-thon. We plan to pick this back up in late February 2019.  If someone identifies the problem and submits a pull request, we will make evaluating that fix a high priority.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Changes: - Added `vcx_connection_send_discovery_features` function to send discovery features message to the specified connection to discover which features it supports, and to what extent. - Updated connection state machine to respond on `Query` and `Disclose` messages after connection is established. - Added new Vcx setting: `actors`. This setting specifies the set of protocols which application supports. The following actors are implemented by default:  inviter, invitee, issuer, holder, prover, verifier, sender, receiver .  You need to edit this list in case application supports the less number of actors.

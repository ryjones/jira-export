CDATA We got the following feedback from community:  Generating tails files takes a *LOOOONG* time. I average about 0.25 sec per maximum credential limit (for issue on demand -- by default is slower) on an Ubuntu 16 VM with 4GB RAM. For example, suppose a medium-sized province may need up to 4 million drivers licences. That's eleven days of compute time, however we want to split it up (more, smaller tails files mean shorter, more frequent delays in credential generation). A developer innocently using the default value of 100000 can effectively hang his box for 7 hours. Surely that can't be the design intent, but I don't see what else I should have done.  Is it expected that indy-sdk will only run on big iron? I don't know what we've specified on the server side for production, but this single operation is MANY ORDERS of magnitude more expensive than anything else in the toolkit, so supporting revocation might bring the house down, yet this is definitely a feature we need.  Does it work appreciably faster for anyone out there, and if so what parameters work well for you? Or else, what is a good tactic to pre-compute tails files before an existing revocation registry is full? Again I come back to needing a way to query how many credentials are issued against an existing revocation registry _(although that might degrade non-correlation? My grasp of the information theory here is sketchy)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We are testing the Indy wallet at scale and finding a that the auto-creation of tags for all claims can in some cases be a detriment. We'd like to see if there can be an option to request that claim tags not be created.  We agree with the choice to make it the default for the more common cases of consumer-type Agents w/wallets, but in our case (TheOrgBook) the very large number of credentials make the tags problematic.  Here are the stats after we loaded about 1M credentials into an instance of TheOrgBook using a test instance of the production source system we'll be using: * table items = 3.8 GB (these are the credentials) * indexes on items = ~100 MB * table tags_encrypted = 3.2 GB * indexes on tags_encrypted = ~ 6.2 GB  In the case of TheOrgBook, about 60% of the data is tags, and we don't need them - we're querying using CredentialID (which is working very well!).  We think this will reduce storage requirements and improve processing speed.  We are planning to have a number of "mass update" events as we bring on additional services, so speed matters, and we'll have many, many Credentials in the database, making size important.  Would it be reasonable to have an optional parameter on the "store credential" call that allows us to provide a (potentially empty) list of claims names to be added as tags?              ></description> </Issue>

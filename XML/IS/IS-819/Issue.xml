CDATA Current Payment API in libindy forces UTXO based payments approach and it is hard to use with non-UTXO based payments. We need to make the API more generalized to support non-UTXO based crypto payments and traditional payments like VISA.  Â   The following changes are suggested: - Instead of "TXO/UTXO" abstraction used as payment inputs use "Source" abstraction.  - Instead of "TXO/UTXO" abstraction used as payment outputs use "Receipt" abstraction.  - Rename get_utxo endpoint to get_sources endpoint  - Add build_verify_payment_req(receipt) and parse_verify_payment_resp(resp) endpoints  - Add OperationNotSupported error code as some operations like minting can't be supported by new payment methods  ></description> </Issue>

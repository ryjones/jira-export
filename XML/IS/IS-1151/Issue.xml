CDATA There have been found several issues: # windows artifacts for *rc* branch don't include indy crypto library itself  https://repo.sovrin.org/windows/libindy_crypto/rc/0.5.0-27/libindy_crypto_0.5.0.zip |https://repo.sovrin.org/windows/libindy_crypto/rc/0.5.0-27/libindy_crypto_0.5.0.zip  # latest *master* build fails during testing:  https://ci.evernym.com/job/Indy%20Crypto%20CD/job/master/73/execution/node/45/log/  I guess that it might cause problems for CI on *master* as well. Seems it might be fixed by switching to newer version of rust instead of 1.25.0. # also I've encountered incorrect syntax of specifying multiple expressions for stash statement in cd file in *master*:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/blob/9d1ffdd0699341e5fd5026756c78ea9aeb17ef66/Jenkinsfile.cd#L159  (comma should be used instead of semicolon)  ></description> </Issue>

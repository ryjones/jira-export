IndySDK 2.0 Goals * Threading model * Language specific wrappers vs tiny bindings in various languages * Re-thinking modularization of the SDK ** Support HW secure enclaves * Support Agent2Agent flows?  h3. Aries Goals * Agent-oriented API * Pluggable resolver (instead of Indy network specific IndySDK 1.0) * Avoid “wallet” term in the meaning of IndySDK glossary  h2. Overview Combining goals of Indy SDK and Aries the next list may be considered as a target * Main part of libindy codebase will be moved to the aries-sdk as libAries * Some codebase may be moved from libvcx to libAries * Language wrappers will be replaced by: ** Various aries language-specific libraries. They may provide more high-level API and be idiomatic with the language. ** Tiny bindings. Tier 1 binding (e.g. rust, python, java) will be part of the main aries-sdk repo and they may be based on current “wrappers” of libindy. It’s nice to have bindings auto generated. * Indy-sdk repository will be devoted to pluggable resolver for Aries to operate with Indy networks * Common pattern from language libraries may be built-in to the libAires in the future.  h2. Open questions * Indy CLI vs Aries CLI * How much libVCX codebase should be built-in into libAries * Pluggable mechanism for network resolver ** Language of API ** Compile or run-time * HW secure enclave seems like easy to implement for simple signatures but problematic for ZKP  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Steps to reproduce: * Create a credential that is 400K * Prepare it for sending on the wire using the new pack/unpack in Indy SDK.  Expected behavior: * Credential should be significantly less than .5 MB  Observed behavior: * Credential is 15 MB with the old LibVCX and 50 MB with in-progress agent to agent protocols.  Notes: * The new HIPE process suggest repeated rounds of embedding the credential in a JSON, encrypting it, base64 encoding it, and embedding it in a new JSON.  Acceptance Criteria: * Identify the cause of the problem * Submit a PR to amend the HIPE * Raise tickets to address the problem  ></description> </Issue>

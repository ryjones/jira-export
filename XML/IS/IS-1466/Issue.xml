CDATA LibIndy functions need to be available to Aries Shared Libraries as C-Callable APIs. Some functions don't have a clear mapping to a current Aries Shared Library (KMS, VDRI). These should live in aries-shared-util.  Examples: * pack / unpack * DID Doc parsing  *Acceptance Criteria* * C-Callable APIs exist in an Aries Utility library that meets the same use cases as are currently met by LibIndy * The API design can be improved during this migration. Client applications will need to adjust their API when they migrate from LibIndy.  ></description> </Issue>

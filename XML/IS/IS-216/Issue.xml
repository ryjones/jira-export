CDATA Usage of JSONParameters in methods signature conflicts with the idea to be as close as possible to the original Indy sdk API. Also in some cases this json's can be extended by user. For example, user can register custom wallet type and configuration params will be managed by user's code.  It is better to use the same types as Indy sdk, but we can leave JSONParameters as dedicated request builders. So instead of   someCall(SomeJSONParameter("a", "b"))  user will just use  someCall(SomeJSONPArameter("a", "b")::toJson())  ></description> </Issue>

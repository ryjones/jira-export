CDATA  ~tylerq   ~nage  We still have no agreement with Linux Foundation about publishing to Maven Central repo from Hyperledger.   Maven Central has packages verification process that can require significant time.  As a workaround for this release, we created our private maven repo on evernym.com and will publish artifacts to this repo if there will be no progress with Maven Central account.  As soon as we will get credentials we can republish Artifacts to Maven central.  From consumer and enterprise teams point of view, it will be a just additional line in pom.xml for some time.  ></body> </Action>

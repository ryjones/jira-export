CDATA Java wrapper artifacts are required for our first release. We need the following:  1. Get credentials to publish to maven central 2. Create script that will perform this piblishing 3. Integrate this script to CI  This will require a few things (some of which we may not be able to do right away): 1) A maven pom that builds the indy wraper such that it can depoly it to a maven repo in a way that handles the c callable libary 2) Setup and permision to pusblish to the Open Source Software Repository Hosting (OSSRH) (http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) 3) Setup and permission to publish to the Maven Central repo  There are likely other steps that I don't know. I know that fabric is publishing a sdk to maven. (See https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java%7Cfabric-sdk-java%7C1.0.1%7Cjar)  ></description> </Issue>

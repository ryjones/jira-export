CDATA Thank you for reporting this problem.  We have an integration test for this behavior, so if this is real then we have a bug in the test as well as in the code.  Because the impact of this issue is limited and there are clear workarounds and a manual remediation, we will postpone fixing this issue until after we have addressed some higher priority projects. In the mean time, this would be a good issue for others to look into.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~smithbk  could you please add 'steps to reproduce' to this issue?  I added a test to libindy/tests/wallet.rs and it does not show this issue.  Maybe the new test is wrong.  Please have look here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1781  Thanks, Axel  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA There is already the  test|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/tests/wallet.rs#L135  test which covers this case.  And it always is run as a part of our CI testing.    ></body> </Action>

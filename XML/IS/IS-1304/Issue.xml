CDATA The delete_wallet call doesn't remove the entire directory The default sqlite impl creates 3 files: sqlite.db, sqlite.db-shm, and sqlite.db-wal. When I call delete_wallet, it doesn't delete sqlite.db though it deletes the others. So when I create, delete, and recreate a wallet with the same name, the recreate fails with a WalletAlreadyExistsError error.  ></description> </Issue>

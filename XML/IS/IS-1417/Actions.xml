CDATA Hello,  ~aaronr  What do you mean under `allows a verifier to see that a prover holds a credential without divulging any information`? Can you share a test? If you pass empty `proof_request` you pass emptyÂ `requested_credentials` on a proof building. In this case the result `proof` will look like: {code:java} {"proof":{"proofs":  ,"aggregated_proof":{"c_hash":"random generated number","c_list":  }},"requested_proof":{"revealed_attrs":{},"self_attested_attrs":{},"unrevealed_attrs":{},"predicates":{}},"identifiers":  } {code} It will pass verification but it will not prove anything. It is totally useless for a verifier.  We can remove the check that proof request isn't empty but this case is useless from our point of view.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Artem,  Sorry that it took me so long to get back to you. This is the proof request that we are using in our tests: {noformat} {'name': 'Nothing', 'properties': {}, 'requested_attributes': {}, 'requested_predicates': {}, 'nonce': '958544744559', 'version': '1.0'}{noformat} I believe it was just a way for a verifier to prompt the user for something. Anything. And the verifier can show that it can respond. Perhaps a tool for problem determination? If you don't feel that this should be a supported scenario, then I can't say that it would cause us any kind of hardship. It was just a test of ours that used to succeed and now doesn't.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi, Aaron, We are moving forward to  Aries|https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs  support as a standard of agent-to-agent communication.  It introduces messages like `trust_ping`, `basicmessage` and `problem_report`. They can be used to share any information.  Thank you for raising the issue but I think it is better to forbid empty ProofRequests and Proofs to eliminate false evidence.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="66674" issue="43068" author="smithbk" type="comment" body="Artem  ~Artemkaaas , the intent here is something different than trust_ping, basicmessage, and problem_report.  How can a prover prove that they possess a specific credential without revealing any additional information (i.e. no attributes or predicates).  For example, suppose that I need to prove that I have a valid passport issued by a particular country, but I don&apos;t want to reveal any additional information in the proof.  How would I do this?" created="2020-01-14 14:51:07.0" updateauthor="smithbk" updated="2020-01-14 14:51:55.0"/>

CDATA  ~smithbk  empty ProofRequest doesn't help you in this case.  There is no opportunity to prove credential possession only. Verifier has to append at least `requested_attribute` and set `cred_def_id` restriction on it (if he want a specific credential).  Prover can set `revealed: false` for this attribute (if he don't want reveal this value). By this Prover proves that possess requested credential but don't reveale any personal information.  ></body> </Action>

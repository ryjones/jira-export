CDATA For proof generation under Section 6 for the Validity Proof:  Part 2b says Let ∆←_mj_− _zj_ and find (possibly by exhaustive search) u1,u2,u3,u4 such that ∆ = (u1)^2+ (u2)^2+ (u3)^2+ (u4)^2;  The code doesn't compute properly for some cases and it should always sum to ∆  Example of ∆ which fails: 107, 112, 115, 119, 253, 1000, 3000 Find the correct implementation attached.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Task Overview* For the moment sdk choose which node to send catchup req to randomly. It would be better to reorder node list according to pong time and does not send catchup req at all if pong is absent. Probably reorder logic could be applied to the nodes who send consistency proof as well - those who send it ordered higher.  Without ordering according to pongs some tests in indy-plenum project could failed randomly and must be rerun.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Corresponded code is written * Integration tests are written and passed * Code is merged and master build with the changes is issued  Note:  It can be efficient to implement together with IS-570  ></description> </Issue>

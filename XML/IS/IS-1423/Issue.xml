CDATA People building on top of Indy are encouraged to start with the Aries agents and language libraries instead of the Indy SDK wrappers. Most of the development has shifted there, and some Aries language libraries are already mature enough to use in favor of the Indy wrappers. As a result, the Indy wrappers will not keep pace with the evolution of the Aries protocols. We need to communicate this information to users of the Indy SDK.  *Wrappers in Round 1* * DotNet  *Acceptance Criteria* * User documentation is updated. * Release notes include a note. * API documentation is marked. * Jira issues related to these wrappers are closed. * A task exists in Jira to remove these wrappers from a future version.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Stephen Klump added a comment - 31/Jan/20 7:59 AM - edited I was timing the two approaches, plus a third ( 1: update state since last timestamp, 2: create state from timestamp=0 3: merge deltas since last timestamp, then create state ).  Imagine my surprise when consistently, the 2nd approach (create state from timestamp=0) came out consistently fastest (the idea is to time the actions after parsing the revocation registry delta response - so it's not too surprising that #3 comes in slowest, since it repeats two calls: merge deltas, then create state).  This is certainly no longer urgent, but when someone has the time and inclination, feel free to look over the sample at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g_EhrTtB0NAvAM8F5dsMovPl30Ctmlgs for wonder and speculation.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Is the discussion regarding synchronous vs thread-safe somewhere documented?  I would advise against a synchronous get_error method because I believe that leads to more trouble for developers.  Why not return a serialized error json in the callbacks? Yes, this changes the API and probably merits a (major?) version number change but doing synchronous programming is soo last century. :)  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="55190" issue="26686" author="gudkov" type="comment" body=" ~ignisvulpis  get_error should be called inside of asynchronous callback in the same place you check error code now. As a result there will be no any significant difference with adding additional error information to callbacks, but it will be 100% backward compatibility and 100% asynchronous code. Also it matters only for C code consumers, all wrappers will have error information in exception or error classes.

CDATA I am certain that some developers will call get_error from outside callbacks thus getting the wrong error message. Anyway, I agree that get_errorÂ  is the most non-intrusive way to add error messages.  What do you think about new API methods, new APIs or changing APIs would you then add an error_json parameter to the callback?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In my vision get_error will be able to return good error message if it will be called in a wrong context as it will require command handle param. Anyway it will affect only C API users as wrappers will not provide get_error. Wrappers will call get_error automatically and convert to native way for corresponded language.   In my vision new API calls should use the current approach. Mixing of different approaches in my vision will just cause more questions and mistakes.   ></body> </Action>

This can lead to a malicious prover to &quot;forge a proof&quot; such that the cryptographic proof is over a different data than the non-cryptographic part. The failing tests can be seen  here| https://github.com/lovesh/indy-sdk/commit/c1e7b5458ebbd9f8d67c18a940fca4e94b8285ec  . There should be a check in `_get_revealed_attributes_for_credential` to ensure that `encoded` is correctly computed from `raw` andÂ `encoded` matches the corresponding value in `primary_proof. eq_proof.revealed_attrs`." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2019-07-18 08:40:47.0" updated="2019-08-28 07:41:47.0" resolutiondate="2019-08-27 13:04:17.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="54297"/>

<Issue id="32032" key="IS-831" number="831" project="10401" reporter="gudkov" creator="gudkov" type="10006" summary="Long API calls should support cancellation" priority="3" status="10405" created="2018-07-18 15:03:52.0" updated="2019-03-29 21:04:23.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="50660"> <description><! CDATA We have some API calls that can be executed significant time. For example: * Wallet export/import * RevReg generation  We need have ability to cancel these calls. I suggest the following: * Keep C API as is without additional cbs or params * Add indy_cancel(cmd_handle) endpoint * For each wrapper analyze ability of cancellation through asyncio API (Future.cancel()). If it is impossible for some wrappers than we can add similar "ext" method for each important endpoint that exposesÂ cmd_handle.  ></description> </Issue>

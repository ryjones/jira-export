CDATA After recent re-factorings, the timeouts for Replies were decreased to 5/10 (ACK/Reply) from 10/50.  This is not enough for IndyNode tests and on production during high load (especially if view change happens in between).  We need to revert the timeouts as a minimum. IS-601 could also be very helpful.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As a result of investigation we found out that hex serialization and deserialization was working incorrect.  If we serialize some data on 64-bit platform and then try to deserialize and serialize it on 32-bit the source and the result won't be equal. The reason is that we serializing not the byte-representation of big number primitives but inner representation of AMCL (which is platform dependent). We made a decision to change the (de)serialization to byte-representation instead of inner representation.  ></body> </Action>

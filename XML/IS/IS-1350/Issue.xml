CDATA https://github.com/swisscom-blockchain/indy-sdk  This project is a custom python wrapper for Hyperledger's Libindy library that aims to optimize and remove redundant code of the existing wrapper.  We don't expect that our wrapper will replace the current one. But we hope that you guys can maybe take some points and merge/implement them into the current one.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.  ></description> </Issue>

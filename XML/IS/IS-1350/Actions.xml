CDATA I think this architecture is fantastic. Especially as we find ourselves at an interesting place in the Indy/Aries lifecycle, I think we are unlikely to see this make it into the Indy SDK today; however, I think we should use this for the Aries SDK python wrapper.  Truly awesome work. Thanks for being willing to contribute it back to the community!  ></body> </Action>

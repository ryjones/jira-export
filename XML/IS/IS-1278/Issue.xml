CDATA *Story*  As a contributor to the Indy CLI who speaks languages in addition to English, I want the strings in the Indy CLI to be in a separate file so that it is easy to localize those strings.     *Notes* * This story is not about providing end-to-end localization, but rather about establishing a minimum pattern for string management that allows future localization. * External strings should be consumable by GNU Gettext in order to be consumable by a wide range of translation tools. * This looks useful:  https://projectfluent.org/   ></description> </Issue>

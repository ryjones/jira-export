CDATA The Indy SDK by default logs messages at the INFO level. This, along with other log settings, should be user-configurable, without requiring developer-level techniques. If this is already provided, it should be documented.  In addition, information that is useful only to RUST developers is logged at the INFO level.Â  Most of this should be logged at DEBUG or TRACE.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA _The fix for this should be made in Ursa first but Indy-sdk will also be affected and the ledger will probably be as the structure of some elements will change._  Currently, the accumulator and witness are created in group G2 but if these were chosen to be in group G1, updating the accumulator as well the witness will be much faster and the accumulator and witness will be shorter (by 50%) in size. This will require swapping of groups at a few places in the revocation scheme. This is only applicable for anoncreds 1.0.  ></description> </Issue>

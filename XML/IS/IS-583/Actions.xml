The math is valid only if you use correct (gp, verkey, signkey) tuple. At least i see that Generator Point contains garbage. . If any of (gp, verkey, signkey) values contain garbade the result is unpredictable. If multiply something by zero it will be always zero." created="2018-03-12 16:40:31.0" updateauthor="gudkov" updated="2018-03-12 17:25:03.0"/>

CDATA > @gudkov @tobowers Yeah, I just looked at your trace. You're using zero for the generator element, which will give you all kinds of bad results. Since it seems like you've already fixed this, I wouldn't worry too much about it. However, note that an adversary can control the bytes for the (message, signature) pair, it cannot control the public or secret keys (or the group generator) and we can generally assume those will be correct (assuming no hardware attacks). Â  > This isn't a bug in indy-crypt, but if it's easy to stop people from using clearly flawed choices (i.e. zero or the point at infinity) as parameters in a side-channel resilient manner (or warn them when they do), it might be worth the time to do it in the long run.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~tobowers  I suggest to close this as there are no bugs in proper use. Not sure that we need to add some additional validation. indy-crypto perform basic validation of values formatting, but seems there was memory breaking case.  Please validate and if you satisfied with the answer move this ticket to Done status.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Reviewing this and I think that such an indy-sdk based feature would be very valuable.  The proposed step one part seems to be trivial - we do that regularly in Indy/Aries apps, so I don't think that's contributing a lot.    The second part of actually defining a viable feature that can be implemented in a presentation would be significant and would go a long way to preventing the "proxied presentations" fraud that is frequently discussed in relation to ZKPs.   In a context where you need to disclose something significant (e.g. making a payment), being able to confirm that other required information (e.g. age greater than) is correlated-but-not-disclosed to the significant credential (e.g. name) without revealing the correlated data is powerful.  Even when there is no significant data, partial disclosure tied with a correlated-but-not-disclosed linkage would be useful. For example, disclosing your first name and that the rest of your full name is the same on different credentials would be non-correlating, but could be used to detect trivial fraudulent uses - e.g. a service selling the use of real credentials for use in scamming ZKP solutions.  If there was an unusual spike in the use of a one name presented by users to a service would lead to investigating if there was abuse occuring.  Is this something that needs to be researched/solved in Ursa and then used in Indy?  Any thoughts on how difficult it might be?  ></body> </Action>

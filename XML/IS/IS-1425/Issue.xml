CDATA Most new developers building on Indy should start with Aries Agents and Aries language libraries. As a result, the documentation for Aries will be more helpful than the legacy documentation in Indy SDK.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Review the documentation to decide what is directly applicable to users of LibIndy, versus what is superseded by the Aries documentation. * Mark the appropriate documentation as deprecated, pointing people to the Aries documentation. * An issue exists to delete the deprecatedÂ  documentation in a future version.  ></description> </Issue>

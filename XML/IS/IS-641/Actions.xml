CDATA  ~esplinr  "their_vk" and "my_vk" are *relative* names so in single test case "my_vk" can be used as sender verkey in one place as well as recipient verkey in another place (and I saw several errors in post-install automation tests like "we put _my_vk_ variable into function because it requires sender verkey and we used _my_vk_ as sender verkey previously but *in this step* _my_vk_ is *recipient* verkey because now I *receive* message in this step) so I think it will be reasonable to use *absolute* naming ("sender_vk" and "recipient_vk") in functions' signatures. Also we have the wrong returned type in signatures now (item 2).  > Can it be done in a backwards compatible way? All this changes should be done in variables names and types that functions take and return only so I think all this changes will be backward compatible because they will cause *no functional changes* in indy-sdk.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indy CLI allows to open and list only wallets created through CLI wallet create command, but it is impossible to access wallet created by 3d party application.   As there is no way to lookup external wallets with libindy we need to help CLI in wallets lookup. I suggest to introduce wallet attach/detach concept and corresponded CLI commands. User can call wallet attach and provide wallet configuration that CLI will store the same way as wallet configuration created with wallet create command.  *Acceptance criteria* * wallet attach command implemented and tested * wallet detach command implemented and tested * CLI doc updated  ></description> </Issue>

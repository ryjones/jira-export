CDATA - As of now, indy-crypto is published to the same deb repo as indy-node - Since we use a specific version of indy-crypto in indy-node, and apt can use the latest version only for dependencies, indy-node build will fail once a new indy-crypto is published  As a solution, we can use a separate repo for indy-crypto (both libindy-crypto and python3-indy-crypto).  ></description> </Issue>

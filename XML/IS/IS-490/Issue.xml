CDATA Indy-sdk pipelines fail to cleanup workspace on Jenkins agents because produce root:root files and dirs inside it. The possible reason: root diles are created from within docker containers that are run as root (uid 0).  It leads to 100% disk usage in Jenkins agents and (I'm sure for about 90%) system not-responding state.  Dirs inside workspace directory with root as owner: * Indy-SDK ** ./cli/target ** ./libindy/debs ** ./libindy/sovrin-packaging/__pycache__ * Indy Crypto ** ./libindy-crypto/debs  ></description> </Issue>

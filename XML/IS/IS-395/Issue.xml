CDATA Recently we intorduced generic keys management functionality, but there are no crypto methods that will work with keys. Only DID-based crypto methods are present.  We need to implement crypto methods that will work with keys and deprecate DID based crypto methods as the same result can be achived by receiving of keys for some DID with indy_key_for_did call.  The list of methods to implement:  - indy_crypto_sign - indy_crypto_verify - indy_crypto_box - indy_crypto_box_open - indy_crypto_box_seal - indy_crypto_box_seal_open  ></description> </Issue>

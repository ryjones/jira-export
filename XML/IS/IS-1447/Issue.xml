CDATA {color:#444444}When trying to verify a proof built with two different credentials from the same institution and with the same credential schema and same credential definition (so the only difference between the two credentials is the time and serial number), then verification fails.{color}  {color:#444444}I've created a modified version of the getting_started Python code at:{color}  {color:#444444} https://github.com/fabienpe/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started_2.py {color}  In this code, at line 312 you can choose issuing 1 or more Transcripts from Faber. If one is issued, then all goes well. If two are issued, then proof with Acme fails. The trace says:  {{{color:#444444}{\{TRACE:indy.libindy.native.ursa.cl.verifier: xxxx\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\ursa-0.2.0\src\cl\verifier.rs:317 | ProofVerifier::verify: <<< valid: false}}{color}}}  The issue only occurs when revocation is enabled.  {color:#444444}Related discussion here:{color}   https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=HPkYohCHdMzo9y3cx   ></description> </Issue>

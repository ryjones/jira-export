CDATA *Story* As a developer building on top of Indy, I need to be able to use fully qualified DIDs in my code so that I can work with peer DIDs or DIDs from other ledgers.  *Goal* * Minimize changes required to Indy Node * A configuration parameter exists for the fully qualified DID prefix that is not required when communicating with an Indy ledger. * If DIDs returned from the ledger do not contain the DID prefix, it should be added when communicating with applications through the APIs  *Acceptance Criteria* * An architecture proposal is prepared * The architecture proposal includes a plan for managing DIDs from multiple ledgers in the wallet * Issues exist for the remaining work  *Notes* * At some point in the future, Aries wallets will contain DIDs from different ledgers. Our current work should move us toward that goal. ** Options *** Convert legacy DIDs in the wallet to include the prefix *** Detect DIDs that do not start "did:" and treat these as legacy DIDs that need the prefix *** Other?  ></description> </Issue>

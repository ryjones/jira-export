CDATA When we have Jenkins build a docker image and start a container in a docker network, there should be no need for it to be a bridged 10.0.0.0/8 network which would have over 16million addresses.      In these scenarios the bridged interface on the OS makes it so that nothing on the docker host can talk to any other external host in the 10/8 network.     The recommendation would be to use a network range like 172.18.0.0/24 etc.. instead.     References to files that need to be changed and tweaked:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/132375a8a779d0d998d923d4a177f97a1b7d32d8/Jenkinsfile.cd#L107   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/165a4d63239675771e528a011b75a7e26de0ff36/Jenkinsfile.ci#L283   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~sergey.minaev   ~gudkov   During work on IS-598 I made some review of mentioned jenkinsfiles (aslo jenkinsfiles for ci should be taken into account) and I think we do not need there custom subnet at all. As of now indy-sdk team uses it to make indy-pool docker container  having|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/e5e13f5cf59469d68e23590736a063c7e2d8c4cc/Jenkinsfile.ci#L358  fixed IP address to  reference|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/e5e13f5cf59469d68e23590736a063c7e2d8c4cc/Jenkinsfile.ci#L235  it from another client-side container.  I suggest the following options: * use user-defined bridge network without specifying any subnet. It will give an ability to reference container to each other by hostnames (could be specified as "–name' during docker run) More details:  https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge|https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/  * use default bridge network. sub-options: ** use '–link' in "docker run" command to have the same ability to reference to other container ( https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/configure-dns/)  ** do not use any hostname (alias) related arguments and resolve pool-network container's IP on-the-fly after it has been started (e.g. using docker inspect command, but it'stricky a bit and seems not stable:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157721/how-to-get-a-docker-containers-ip-address-from-the-host)   In case one of hostname / alias related options IP can be resolved using getent tool (which is available without any additional packages installation) from within any container inthe same network like that: *getent hosts <indy-pool-container-name> | awk '\{print $1}'*     ></body> </Action>

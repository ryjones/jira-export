CDATA  ~ozheregelya    We discussed this internally and it seems that this request doesn't correspond to our domain.   The main problem here is that libindy supports plugged wallet, but "encrypted/non-encrypted" is a quality of default wallet only.   There is no internal API to understand is this wallet "encrypted" or not. It can be achieved only through breaking API changes.  So, i suggest to skip this feature.  ></body> </Action>

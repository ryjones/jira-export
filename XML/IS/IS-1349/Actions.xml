This appears to be in the libindy API.  The Java wrapper has started moving to Aries. We will investigate whether this is something we should fix in Indy or if it should be addressed in the Aries wrapper.   https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-sdk-java   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hello,  ~MinjiHan   Is the problem still actual for the latest indy versions? The description doesn't contain enough information to understand what happened. Have you tried to enable core dump file writing? It should give more details. What OS do you use?  I tried to reproduce the issue on my local machine (Uubntu 16.04) and inside docker (Ubuntu 18.04). I used libindy and java wrapper of 1.11.0 version.  But I had to use java 11 because java 12 version isn't supported anymore.  `proverDeleteCredential` worked fine for me.  ></body> </Action>

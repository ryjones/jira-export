CDATA For the current moment Indy Crypto is linked with simple logger that outputs logs to stdout/stderr, but best practice for libraries is to use logger that will be provided by application to re-use application logging facilities.  We suggest the following: - Â Indy Crypto should provide set_logger call that will allow application to register logging callbacks - or development purposes Indy Crypto should also provide set_default_logger call that will allow to register simple logger bundled with Indy Crypto. We can keep the same logger behavior as we have for now. I only suggest to disable logging by default. - Also we need to make Rust interface logging compatible with libindy. For now they are use different log crate version.  Acceptance criteria: - Follow design in IS-2 - API is implemented with TDD aprroach - Good integration tests coverage is provided - Documentation is provided - Dependent teams (Indy Node) are notified about expected changes  ></description> </Issue>

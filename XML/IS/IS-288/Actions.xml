CDATA  ~mgbailey   We haven't supported 'TRUST_ANCHOR'  role before. I have created a P which will add supporting of this role. ( https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/209 ) But you wrote that you can build and send nym request with this role. It looks strange.  I can not reproduce it on  indy_sdk=0.1.1-119, indy_plenum=1.0.95 and indy_node=1.0.105  ></body> </Action>

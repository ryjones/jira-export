It looks like duplication for https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-511 that is already in our backlog. Could you re-check?" created="2018-12-17 12:44:55.0" updateauthor="gudkov" updated="2018-12-17 12:44:55.0"/>
<Action id="54867" issue="36157" author="xnopre" type="comment" body="Hi  ~gudkov  . There is no description in IS-511 but yes, it seems to be duplication. But IS-511 was created one year ago... This point is very disadvantageous (painful) working all the day with the SDK... Is it possible to fix it soon ? " created="2018-12-17 13:40:14.0" updateauthor="xnopre" updated="2018-12-17 13:40:14.0"/>

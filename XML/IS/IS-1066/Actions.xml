CDATA Build Info: libindy 1.6.8~45 python3-indy 1.6.8.dev45  Steps to Validate: 1. Get existing nym/schema/cred_def from 1 single alive node in the pool to check general state proof availability. 2. Run benchmark test against STN to get existing schemas and cred_defs to check average response time.  Actual Results: We have working state proofs for all txn types (not only for NYMs as before). We have 1.2637479336421864 seconds average schema response time and 0.3993049508309923 seconds average cred_def response time during 130 test runs (they were from 5 to 30 seconds before the fix).  ></body> </Action>

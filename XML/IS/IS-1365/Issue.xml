CDATA The Indy ledger resolver needs to migrate from LibIndy to be used by Aries Frameworks. The end result is that we have libraries like: * aries-shared-vdri that provides the interface that will be followed by specific ledgers * indy-aries-vdr that instantiates that interface for Indy * aries-shared-vdri-peer that instantes that interface for peer DIDs  This issue is only to migrate the LibIndy functions to indy-aries-vdr. The common interface will be designed in other issues, and indy-aries-vdr will be migrated to it.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Create design document for this interface that can be followed by Peer DIDs and the Indy Resolver * Create a plan of attack that can be followed by the various contributors * Create related issues  *Notes* * Prior Art ** Aries RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0124-did-resolution-protocol ** The work from Markus: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16320115 * This work must be coordinated with the in-progress work being done by  ~cywolf  * The work to build a generic Aries Verifiable Data Registry Interface will be tracked separately (probably in the Aries project). * The work to build an Aries Peer VDRI will be tracked separately.  ></description> </Issue>

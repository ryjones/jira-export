For now it&apos;s clear that it caused by usage of specific docker network subnet. I tested with different subnets including one suggested in IS-521 but no luck so far. I will investigate the issue deeper asap." created="2018-03-22 15:20:50.0" updateauthor="andkononykhin" updated="2018-03-22 15:20:50.0"/>

CDATA After some research I found the following things: * all dns issues appeared on only three of jenkins agents: 12, 24 and 25 * after some tries on these machines I got the following error *docker: Error response from daemon: grpc: the connection is unavailable.* According to  https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/31849  it's a kind of issue which for now could only be fixed by docker service restart: *systemctl restart docker*. sudo is not enough for that there (seems configured so by AWS) * from within docker containers on other agents I was able to get dns responses even using user-defined bridge docker network  Thus, I was wrong in my previous comment: custom subnet is not the reason of failures, but seems docker daemon from some time have been working wrong.  How to fix: need to restart agents 12, 24 and 25 to make docker daemon restarted as well.  ~dfarns  Could you restart these agents?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem reason: - indy sdk ci pipelines failed because of hostnames were not resolved  Changes: - restarted docker services on the part of jenkins agents  Risk factors: - Nothing is expected.  Risk: - Low  Recommendations for QA: do the following sequence of steps * review resent PR builds on Jenkins and check that there are no dns problems on any Jenkins agents  ></body> </Action>

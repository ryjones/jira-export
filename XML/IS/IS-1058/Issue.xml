CDATA xcode version: 10.0.1  MacOS: 10.14     ></environment> <description><! CDATA I try to run the iOS demo cases in my Mac. But it seems that sdk does not support xcode 10.0.1. I will give more detailed info as below. And from the iOS readme, the OpenSSL should be installed from Podfile. But there is a issue when pod install with OpenSSL without version specified.  *cp: file.tgz: No such file or directory*  This issue will be fixed when I change podfile  to specify the *OpenSSL-Universal as version 1.0.1.16*. As I found that this is the right version that CoreBitCoin supports. So I changed it.     After pod install. I try to test it with the command:  *xcodebuild* test -workspace Indy.xcworkspace -scheme Indy-demo -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone X,OS=12.1' (For xcode 10.0.1 only got iOS 12.1.)     I got some warning from the start:  _warning: The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 6.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions for this platform is 8.0 to 12.1.

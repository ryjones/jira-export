<Action id="29597" issue="20049" author="danielhardman" type="comment" body="We have had a community member volunteer to write a node.js wrapper, but that was several months ago, and they have not showed any progress. Therefore, there are not currently any firm plans to provide this. Evernym itself does not need a node.js wrapper in the near term. However, I heard last week about someone who needed a node.js wrapper, and this mention on rocket.chat represents a second instance of the question. So we could decide to take it on. In order to prioritize it, i would want to know how much effort it would take to do it, how comfortably it aligns with skills that our current developers already have, and how much ongoing cost there would be to maintain it. Can you provide any of that insight,  ~gudkov ?" created="2017-08-09 13:16:17.0" updateauthor="danielhardman" updated="2017-08-09 13:16:17.0"/>

CDATA Tested the wallet functions, and added buffer support. Fixed race conditions in the c++. Generated API documentation for the readme. Published a sample to npm and improved+documented how the install process works. Whats left: * Adding nodejs wrapper to Jenkinsfile.cd and Jenkinsfile.ci * Testing on osx and windows * Adding tests for the rest of the api (I don't imagine many suprises here since I'm generating the c++ code and already testing various kinds of inputs)  ></body> </Action>

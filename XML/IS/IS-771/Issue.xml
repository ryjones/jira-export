CDATA Do this ticket after IS-770.  Hook up the test written in IS-770 such that it will be run automatically and regularly. The simplest way to do this would be to hook it to continuous integrationâ€“but that may be impractical if the test requires compilers that are not present on some dev machines. Possibly we could make the IS-770 test exercise whatever compilers are present, but not fail on ones that are missing? Or possibly we could make the IS-770 test run automatically but not with every checkin, on a specialized machine?  ></description> </Issue>

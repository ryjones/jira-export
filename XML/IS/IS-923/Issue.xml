CDATA We need to create end-2-end sample or test that will explain VCX usage basics and use cases that VCX covered. I suggest the following:  - Use the same Acme/Fiber scenario that we use for libindy - Adopt this scenario to VCX - Implement this scenario as a code sample with good comments - Put it to indy-sdk repo (check with the team for a good folder)  Acceptance criteria:  - Sample is created inside of indy-sdk repo - There is a reference from README.md to this sample - There is documentation on how to run this sample  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA adding slack comment: In scope IS-923 please do the following: • Examine VCX GSG from Darko (PR 1136, IS-935) (read, try to run, figure out what is missed or can be improved) • compare VCX GSG with Indy GSG • look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx/wrappers/python3/demo as it used as e2e VCX sample multiply times • Figure out is it possible to use VCX GSG as e2e sample? Should this GSG be updated in direction to be more similar with python demo?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The VCX getting started guide is pretty good:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/docs/getting-started/getting-started.md  The Aries community is going to take a different approach, as they will be handling credential exchange in the language libraries instead of the shared libraries. So we won't be doing further LibVCX tutorials.  ></body> </Action>

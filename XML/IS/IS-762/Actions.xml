Run artifact 2. create pool (genesis file is taken from AWS pool with 25 nodes) 3. connect to pool 4. create and open wallet 5. try send NYM 6. read default Trustee NYM  *Actual results:* Artifact isn't compatible with 32-bit version On 64-bit version connection with pool has been established, nym has been read, nym writing has been failed because pool already lost its consensus ("Response hasn't been received")  FYI  ~Artemkaaas   ></body> </Action>

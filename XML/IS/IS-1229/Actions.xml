CDATA Android crashes on attempting to detach thread while still running code. This appears for java tests also but as a warning and passes. Here is  link|https://java-native-access.github.io/jna/4.2.1/com/sun/jna/Native.html#setCallbackThreadInitializer-com.sun.jna.Callback-com.sun.jna.CallbackThreadInitializer-  I found how to avoid detaching of a callback that is called frequently.  I'm not sure that it is a definitely correct solution but it works.   Fixed in PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1733    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Please see this issue that has an explanation of one effort/attempt to validate that this issue is fixed: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1252  I have updated my comments in the ticket https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1252 to show that the logging is now working. I found out the reason our mobile app was crashing this time was due to an incorrectly configured {{RNFirebaseBackgroundMessagingService}} but that is now fixed and the logging works and it does not crash. Thank you.  ></body> </Action>

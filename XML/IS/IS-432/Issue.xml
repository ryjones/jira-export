CDATA There is a Batch operation supported by the Pool. The client needs to have a possibility to send multiple Requests in one Batch:  {code} submit_batch() {code} This will be a batch in the transport level, that is we can send multiple requests by one call to the Node. It may reduce amount of connection and requests to nodes. So, this is different from CLI batching that CLI batching just sends multiple commands one by one (in a common way) while transport batch should sent all of them at once.  ></description> </Issue>

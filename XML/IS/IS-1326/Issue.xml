CDATA *Story* As a user of an application designed for an Indy network, I want the application to be able to talk to the ledger without my having to get special ports opened on the firewall.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Client communication should use a standard port such as 80 or 443 * Client communication should also be standard for the port is uses so that it passes deep packet inspection  *Notes* * Because agent communication is encrypted by default, we might prefer to use port 80.  ></description> </Issue>

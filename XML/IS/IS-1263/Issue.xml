CDATA Build Info: libindy 1.8.3~1097  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get current time timestamp. 2. Write REVOC REG DEF and REVOC REG ENTRY. 3. Try to read REVOC REG using state proof (from 1 alive node) and timestamp from Step 1.  Actual Results: Consensus is impossible error. If we use timestamp that is newer than REVOC REG DEF than we read state proof successfully.  Expected Results: We should make successfull state proof reading in both cases.  ></description> </Issue>

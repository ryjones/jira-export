CDATA *Story* As a developer of an application for an Indy network, if I try to create a credential definition that is already in the wallet, I want the wallet to return the identifier for the cred def instead of giving me an error that it already exists so that it is easy for me to use the cred def.  After making the create call, the developer should be able to use the previously existing cred def the same as if it was newly created.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Suppose I have two processes (for simplicity, on the same host): * process 0 opens the pool * process 1 wants to connect to it.  Process 0 calls pool.create_ledger_config() with pool name and \{{{"genesis_txn": ".../genesis.txn"}}}, then calls pool.open_pool_ledger() on the pool name.  It would be lovely if process 1 could use the pool, getting a handle to it by name, given that it already is open. As it stands, process 1can't create it because it's already created, and can't open it because it's not possible to open a pool twice on its name. It can't use the open pool connection because it's in another process. The way I understand it, the process can use the pool under a different name as long as its ledger configuration is a copy of process 0's pool's ledger configuration.  ></description> </Issue>

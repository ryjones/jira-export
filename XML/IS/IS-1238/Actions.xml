CDATA Both IndySDK and Indy Node are built in Ubuntu 16.04 environment so Indy isn't affected on ubuntu platform as Ubuntu 16.04 provides libzmq 4.1.4.  BTW we use libzmq 4.2 on MacOS, Windows and Android env but it's only client side.   ~MikeLodder Â could you provide your expertise here: is client side affected by this vulnerability? If yes - we have to update our deps in client packages If no - we can close this issue as we are not affected  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="59745" issue="39311" author="mikelodder" type="comment" body="After further investigating, I firmly believe the client side is not affected by this. The issue occurs during the handshake phase when connecting to the server and the server not doing enough checks for the message size which allows the attacker to set it to whatever they want. Only an unauthenticated client can do this and I believe Indy is using CURVE authentication from what I can see." created="2019-05-06 12:36:39.0" updateauthor="mikelodder" updated="2019-05-06 12:36:39.0"/>

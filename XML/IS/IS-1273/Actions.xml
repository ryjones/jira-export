CDATA I think this clippy warning is now renamed   https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#cognitive_complexity   I think there is not much we can do for the `execute` methods in commands like   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/commands/ledger.rs#L291   Readability is not really a problem, I think. The structure of the execute methods is quite simple.  Another topic is LLVM optimization. Not sure how the compiler translates a big 'switch statement' into code and what we can do.  The number of items in the match-statement is the number of methods for one command executor. More executors?     or `# allow(clippy::cognitive_complexity) `        ></body> </Action>

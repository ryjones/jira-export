CDATA The genesis transaction that were created using a tool to allow for custom alias names put quotes around the port numbers.  {code} "client_port":"9702" {code}  When you add a new node or use our test script to generate the genesis files there are no quotes around the port numbers.  {code} "client_port":9702 {code}  The CLI must be checking and converting the port numbers from a string to an int because it has no problems.  *{color:#d04437}Issue{color}* Libindy throws a merkle error if the genesis file has port numbers as strings instead of an int. When we remove the quotes Libindy will connect to the pool, but cannot sync because now the pool ledger does not match.  The live pool was setup this way as well. Now we have a mix in the ledger of the genesis nodes with quotes around port numbers and all nodes added after genesis do not.  I have attached the sandbox file for the Sovrin Test Network. When fixing this issue please test your connection using this genesis file.  *NOTE* We need this fixed as soon as possible because we have customers that need to connect to the STN pool using Libindy.  ></description> </Issue>

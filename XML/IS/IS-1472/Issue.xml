CDATA Original issue from  ~CHempel  of eSatus: {quote}I'm facing some issues with proofing credentials issued on cred defs with revocation support.  When there's only one credential issued for the corresponding revoc reg everything is fine.  But if I issue another credential, every following proof is verified as false.  Thanks, Christopher {quote}  ~sklump  has provided an example of the problem in a relatively small python program found  here|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HY20iVK0Aah2U2dVHUqnN7nM0_jVMSCU/view .  We're getting close to the point where we need to use revocation in production so this is pretty high priority for us and other members of the community.     ></description> </Issue>

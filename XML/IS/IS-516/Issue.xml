CDATA ( ~gudkov : Adding this after reviewing the fix for IS-421. The fix was great, but it raised this issue in my mind...)   Right now we are making the assumption that when we validate a signature, we always want to use the current verkey for a given DID. Hence, indy_key_for_did() just maps a DID to its current key.  When we are dealing with signed stuff, we need to be able to say, "This was signed 9 months ago. I therefore want the verkey for a DID–but I want the value that was current 9 months ago, not the one that's valid today." We could accomplish this by adding an "as_of_timestamp" param to the indy_key_for_did() function, with its default value equal to null or zero, meaning "right now". Perhaps there are other ways to accomplish the same thing...  ></description> </Issue>

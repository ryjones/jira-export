CDATA As far as we can see right now, the most proficient way to expose this functionality through two calls that will allow to use libindy straightforwardly 1. {{vcx_sign_with_payment_address}} allows to sign some info with payment address {code:java} pub extern fn vcx_sign_with_payment_address(command_handle: u32, payment_address: *const c_char, message_raw: *const u8, message_len: u32, cb: Option<extern fn(xcommand_handle: u32, err: u32,  signed_message: *const c_char)>) {code} 2. {{vcx_verify_with_payment_address}} allows to verify some info with payment address {code:java} pub extern fn vcx_sign_with_payment_address(command_handle: u32, payment_address: *const c_char, message_raw: *const u8, message_len: u32, signature_raw: *const u8, signature_len: u32, cb: Option<extern fn(xcommand_handle: u32, err: u32,  result: bool)>) {code}  They will also be implemented in wrappers. If you wish some other experience from libvcx, please contact us.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I think the second example is mislabeled.  Â   I wonder if there is a way to merge these APIs with the already existing "vcx_connection_sign_data()" and "vcx_connection_verify_signature()". Maybe the payment address is optional and if it is present then it will be used rather than the pairwise verkey.  ></body> </Action>

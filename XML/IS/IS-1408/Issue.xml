CDATA As a Verifier I should be able to request optional attributes in Proof Request and it's up to Holder decision to fill those or not  While verification libindy should process this flag appropriately and doesn't affect that part of Verifier App.  *Notes*  * This is about the verifier requesting to know if information exists in a signed credential, but not rejecting the proof if the holder refuses to share that information. Attributes that are empty are handled in IS-1421.  ></description> </Issue>

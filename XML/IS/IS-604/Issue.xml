CDATA We need to support Anoncreds transactions and protocol entities versioning for smooth integration with Indy Node without breaking changes:  - Node supports old versions of SCHEMA and CRED_DEF transactions only and we don't plan to perform breaking changes for few month - But new Anoncreds API uses new versions of SCHEMA and CRED_DEF transactions  We suggest the following:  - all anoncreds calls should support old and new version of Anoncreds transactions. There will be internal calls \{entity}_to_sdk_version() that will be used to update version of Anoncreds entity to the current sdk version. - Transaction builders should also accept any version of anoncreds entity and convert it to version supported by ledger by calling \{entity}_to_ledger_version()  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As a user of an application build on an Indy network, my application should always respond within 2 seconds of my requesting an action so that I have confidence my credentials are available when I need them.  *Background* Sometimes libIndy will make a read request to a ledger node that is slow to respond. LibIndy should employ multiple strategies  to ensure a good user experience even in these situations.  ></description> </Issue>

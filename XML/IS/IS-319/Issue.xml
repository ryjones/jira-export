CDATA As as Indy SDK user, I need to be able to rotate my verky and update it in the ledger  A possible solution: - create a temporary key-pair for a DID (not overriding the current one); - send NYM txn for the new verkey (signing with the old/current one) - apply tmp key-pair for the DID (override the current one with the new one); - remove temporarily key-pair  The operation need to be atomic, that is if we NYM is updated, but applying new verkey failed, we need to re-try to apply it, or revert NYM to the old (current) one sending another NYM txn.  It must be tested and added to all wrappers  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thank you  ~vikpande  for reporting this issue and for submitting a PR to address it.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1407  The Indy project has evolved to centralize all of its documentation at ReadTheDocs. The documentation for the .NET wrapper has not been updated to use the new structure, so it's complicated to accept the PR. We'll keep collaborating on it at GitHub.  A good place for real time collaboration on Indy documentation is #indy-outreach at http://chat.hyperledger.org.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We were thinking we would need to update the accumulator with every issuance. Now I'm second guessing that for the following reasons: 1. there can be a correlation with issuance based on timing 2. there is a timing requirement (and possible race conditions) where the claim could be issued before the accumulator is changed and fully propagated, which means the newly issued claim is not usable for a time. 3. adds load; now only revocations need to be written to the Sovrin Ledger.We can still support issuance for previously revoked claims.  ></description> </Issue>

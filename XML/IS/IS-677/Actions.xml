I have started on it (facing some issuing in getting the manually built library loading, once I get through it, I&apos;ll test if I see improvements on that branch as Slava suggested). Will keep updating this ticket with my progress" created="2018-05-04 06:20:36.0" updateauthor="rajesh.kalaria" updated="2018-05-04 06:20:36.0"/>

CDATA After seeing the details of this issue, we do not think this is the same problem as we were discussing that the wallet struggles with concurrent connections (IS-660).  We suspect that this is caused by the slow performance of opening a wallet: the decryption is rather expensive. We see that the wallet implementation being provided by  ~dkulic 's team has improved performance in this area. The next step would be to try and reproduce this issue on that wallet.  ~rajesh.kalaria  is planning to do that test.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I spent some time creating a similar test using the libvcx SDK and the VCX python wrapper.  I created a script that will simultaneously launch connections (using python multiprocess).  Anything over 10 connections causes exceptions and libvcx stops responding.  I am using libindy_1.3.0 and vcx-0.1.9093651.  I am testing in a virtual environment I created with a vagrant script.  I have a single enterprise that creates multiple unique connections.  All the enterprise connections use the same wallet, on the agency side each connection has it's own wallet.  ></body> </Action>

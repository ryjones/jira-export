CDATA This issue was apparently caused by Python 3 asyncio and not sovrin.  ~mgbailey  suggested that I add "await asyncio.sleep(0)" after all of my await calls to force the asyncio io loop toÂ yield control to the next pending task. Doing so has resolved the problem.  I did not have an option to close -> won't fix or similar, so I set status to "Done". Please advise if doing so isn't appropriate.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I apparently had two clones of the project in my AWS VM and ran my test against a version that was simply checking if the DID exists on the ledger and was not creating the identity with the TRUST_ANCHOR role.  Once I discovered that I ran the test against the wrong clone, I tried the test against the code that has the "await asyncio.sleep(0)" calls and the result was a hang as described in the description on this issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mgbailey  suggested adding an `asyncio.sleep(3)` instead of `asyncio.sleep(0)`. Adding `asyncio.sleep(3)` after ledger.sign_and_submit_request seems to be working. {code:java} await ledger.sign_and_submit_request(pool_handle, steward_wallet_handle, steward_did, nym_txn_req) await asyncio.sleep(3){code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hangs of Indy SDK is fixed in IS-123 But in this case the issue on Node side is present, check INDY-1069 In this particular log consensus isn't reached  ></body> </Action>

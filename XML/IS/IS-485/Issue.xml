CDATA *background*  As a Verifier I want to be able to send a very simple proof request that essentially says "Please give me your First Name, Last Name, Membership Number, etc" and I just list attribute names, _without_ specifying a schema reference number OR a list of issuers, *so that a prover can easily fulfill a proof using whichever issuer or schema reference number they want*.   *AC*  # Given I'm creating a proof request, I want to be able to list some attributes I want the prover to send back to me like:  # Address 1 # Address 2 # First Name # Last Name  And so on.   Additional requirements:   # I should be able to send this type of proof request WITHOUT specifying a schema reference number or issuer.   ></description> </Issue>

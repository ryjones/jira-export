CDATA *Story* As a developer of an application using LibVCX for credential exchange, I want to be able to fulfill a proof request without first creating a connection so that I can complete the VC-Authn-OIDC flow implemented in ACA-Py and get access to services provided by BC.gov to citizens.  *Notes* * The VC-Authn-OIDC flow implemented in ACA-Py needs to be supported in LibVCX so that users of Evernym's Connect.Me can fulfill proof requests without making connections (the ephemeral credential flow). * See: https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/DemoInstructions.md  ></description> </Issue>

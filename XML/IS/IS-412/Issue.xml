CDATA The basic idea here is that the crypto code belongs in Indy-crypto and not Indy-sdk; meaning, details of serialization and protocol belong in the sdk but anything that leverages pairings or encrypt/decrypt our signature checking should go into the lower level library.  This should allow the crypto to be audited and shared with other projects.   This story is about design of this migration. We need to:  1. Define the new consistent API for indy crypto 2. Check do we need python wrapper for this API 3. Check  that there is no Sovrin only parts 4. Design integration approach with Indy SDK  I expect that PoA will be created as result of this ticket.  ></description> </Issue>

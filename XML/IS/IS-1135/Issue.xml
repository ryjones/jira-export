CDATA libindy tests should be able  to be run in parallel in separate threads in Rust and this makes `cargo test` for libindy. New contributors do not know the need to run the tests in a single thread and might turn away because of the failing test.  The reason is that the tests use the same names for wallets, pools etc  Also e.g. the wallet tests use the same (default) directory to store the wallet and the test tear-down methods delete data of tests running in parallel. Tests for the inmem wallet do their clean-up by throwing away all inmem-wallet handles.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

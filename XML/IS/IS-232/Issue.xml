CDATA * Rename libindy package name from indy-sdk to indy * Rename corresponded cargo artifacts    {quote} 6:58   Normally I see the crate name used with ```extern``` statement is same as the name of crate on  https://crates.io|https://crates.io/ . Would it not be easier and more intuitive for us to do the same. Remember I am a noob in Rust so if what I feel is not right correct me. I do feel the sdk will be probably be used by several people outside of our organisation and it should be as intuitive as possible. How about we rename this to indysdk instead of indy-sdk and then we wont need this kind of difference. @daniel.hardman would you like to comment on this.  daniel.hardman   7:11 PM   Since the library is "libindy", I believe "indy" is the correct crate name--not "indysdk" or even "indy-sdk".  farooq.khan  7:25 PM   @daniel.hardman do you mean that on  https://crates.io|https://crates.io/  also it should be named as “indy” or is it okay for it to be named as “indy-sdk” on crates.io (edited)  daniel.hardman  10:46 PM   I think it should be named "indy"; it's not the whole sdk, but rather just one library asdasd {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

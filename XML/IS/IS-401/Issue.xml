CDATA For the current moment wallet service only provides generic set/get methods and definition of entities types and entities persistence code is present in different code parts.  It makes hard to understand what entities we have and complicates persistence logic.  I suggest to move all entities definition to one package and move all persistence helpers to one package. It will provide the good vision of persistence model and simplify wallet versioning and migrations.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA VCX Java wrapper already pipes logs from libvcx and libindy on library loading (use slf4j logging facade).  It has been done in the scope of IS-952.  As I know Android AAR artifacts builds based on Java wrapper. So, logs should be available on the last master build. The building of android artifact isn't part of our CD process. So, AAR should be built manually.  ></body> </Action>

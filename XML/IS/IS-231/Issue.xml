CDATA I was the one who proposed the name "signus" for the portion of the code that worries about signing, as opposed to the portion that worries about storage of secrets. It was a brainstorm, and it was the best idea I could come up with at the time. But I have never loved it.  I think this needs to be renamed.  I do not know what the right name would be; I think we are still in flux a little bit about how to organize our mental model around wallets. "Gatekeeper"? "Signer"? Perhaps our new crypto engineers,  ~brentzundel  and Mike Lodder, will have an idea. Maybe  ~gudkov  or  ~ashcherbakov  will.  We can let this ticket sit for a while while we think about it, but I recommend we do something about it before the first official refresh of the SDK.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When a credential is added in a prover's wallet the following function is called:  {code:python} async def prover_store_credential(wallet_handle: int, cred_id: Optional str , cred_req_metadata_json: str, cred_json: str, cred_def_json: str, rev_reg_def_json: Optional str )  {code}  The fourth argument (i.e., cred_json) is provided by the issuer and it is used when constructing proofs (i.e., in prover_create_proof). However, it seems that it is impossible to extract if from the wallet. In all provided examples and tests cred_json is stored as a public variable. However this is cumbersome for real deployments.       ></description> </Issue>

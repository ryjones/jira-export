CDATA Problem reason: - Nonce has been parsed without any validation of its value, so the results were unpredictable  Changes: - Added validation of nonce using Ursa serialization  PR: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2010  Version: - master #1420  Risk factors: - No risk factors, just validation enforcement  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2010/files#diff-0f30a584fc3ba7a8cee1d1d1efb54a01R339  Recommendations for QA - try to use invalid nonces (like hex nonces, random strings)  ></body> </Action>

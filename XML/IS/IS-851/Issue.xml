CDATA *Story* As a developer building solutions on an Indy network, I want to be able to easily consume LibVCX in my development environment in advance of a LibVCX build pipeline being created.  *Acceptance Criteria* * A contained environment exists where libVCX can be reproducibly built.  *Notes* * BC.gov would prefer a dockerized environment published to Docker Hub. * This is intended to be an interim deliverable. If a full CI / CD pipline can be quickly provided, that would be preferable to delivering this story. * We should verify whether the current Evernym build Docker is appropriate for use by the Hyperledger community.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA An Indy CLI user can do the following:  # Load a plugin by specifying the library and initializer  An Indy CLI user is unable to do the following (each of these could be a sub-task):  # List loaded plugins # Unload/Reload plugins  Perhaps reorganizing plugin management to something like the following would be sufficient?  {panel} plugin ---> list ---> load library=<path> initializer=<init method> ---> unload <path or some ID listed using the `plugin list` command> ---> reload library=<path>  initializer=<init method>  {panel}  Additional considerations (each of these could be a sub-task):  # Should the `about` Indy CLI command list all loaded plugins (same list produced by `plugin list` above)? # Should plugins be loadable using a configuration file? Much like .bashrc and .bash_profile are to bash, and .vimrc is to VIM?  ></description> </Issue>

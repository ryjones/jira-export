CDATA  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1518  creates different wallets for most tests and deletes them at the end of the test.  This subtask should remove the global constant POOL and make each test use a different pool which is deleted at the end of the test.   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/tests/utils/constants.rs#L3   Â   I suggest to name pools after the tests they are created in but this might not be enough because the are tests with equal name in different modules.  ></description> </Issue>

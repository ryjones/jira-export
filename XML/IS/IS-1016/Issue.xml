CDATA The rate of stakeholder adoption of digital peer-2-peer identity proofing is highly dependent on the flexibility of a solution to support both offline and online verification models between a holder and a verifier. While Indy (currently @ v1.6.1) provides ZKP support for the proofing process between a holder and verifier for online interactions, Indy will not be a complete interoperable solution until is can (a) co-exisit with existing traditional  identity readers (b) support offline interactions.     This epic is based on several related dependencies in both Indy and the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification. A detailed problem description along with supporting evidence for the  requirements are outlined in this repo|https://github.com/vinomaster/offline-vcreds .  ></description> </Issue>

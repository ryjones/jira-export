CDATA This is partially supported today by the work we did to cache credentials for offline use (IS-1075).  We also plan additional work to support the W3C VC specification, which will be tracked in a separate epic (with many stories in the Aries project).  We have also been working on authentication use cases for interaction with traditional identity readers (DID-Auth, and integration with OpenID Connect).  Additional work is probably necessary for a full solution to these use cases, but the design should start at the Aries tier and only create Indy issues to add the functionality required to support the Aries applications. I will close this epic as "Deferred". Someone who plans to do this work can reopen the epic.  ></body> </Action>

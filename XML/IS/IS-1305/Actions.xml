CDATA I suggest creating a new document in: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/configuration.md  Additional topics that it would be good to document: * Where is the LibIndy configuration file * Where is the Indy CLI configuration file * How to enable logging  I recognize that documentation could  take a significant amount of time. I think we should cap our effort at this time to a half-engineering day.  ></body> </Action>

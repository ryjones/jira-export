CDATA LibIndy allows clients to set the order in which they want to read from validator nodes. This can allow stewards to prefer querying their own node.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/pool.rs#L72  This needs to be documented.  The documentation should note that consistently querying a single node can open up a class of attacks against a user, but the BLS signature can help to detect if the node is malicious.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story*   As a researcher interested in the reliability of an Indy Network, I need an API that gives me the canonical transaction serialization so that I can verify that the signatures match the transactions on the ledger.  *Notes* * Transactions are stored on the ledger as JSON, but JSON does not guarantee the ordering of the contents. We need to consistently serialize the JSON before signing it so that our signatures are valid. * The system uses a custom serialization routine which isn't currently available as a public API. Plenum's implementation  can be found here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/common/serializers/signing_serializer.py  * There is a matching implementation in libindy that should be available to interested developers.  ></description> </Issue>

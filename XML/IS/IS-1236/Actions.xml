CDATA  ~sergey.minaev  He is attempting to use indy-cli with this command: * did rotate-key seed=<new_seed>  The key is changed on the ledger, but not in the local wallet. It should be changed in both places simultaneously. As it is, the DID is left unusable with the current wallet as a result of this command, since there is no other way in the cli to change the local key for a DID.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mattnorton  have you tried to call `did rotate-key resume=true`?   There is a chance that CLI didn't receive a reply from Node because of high load on the pool and didn't apply temporary key. Here are a ticket IS-1036  that describe a problem you faced.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Right now libindy checks this restrictions at  `prover_get_credentials_for_proof_req` call on Prover side. And in the attached sample there is no credential reference for the requested predicate. I can confirm, that anoncreds.verifier_verify_proof doesn't check restriction here. If Prover is cheating (as shown in the sample - provide proof signed by another DID) and verifier just call libindy without additional application-level checks, false-positive result will be returned.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~esplinr  This is VERY core functionality that has been broken forever. With this ticket, I kept thinking we would see it working any time now... but it has never been actually delivered.  ~ryanmarsh  tells me that it seems to have been lost in a refactor. Please reopen and prioritize this for delivery.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~esplinr   ~mgbailey  Last time I checked, verification was not working. It is as simple as requesting a proof from credential A and providing credential B. If the field name is the same, it will succeed (even though it should fail).  ~mgbailey  is able to reproduce this very easily. I have not personally tested this in a while.     {{}}  ></body> </Action>

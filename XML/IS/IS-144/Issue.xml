CDATA We have big amount of libindy tests that doesn't perform resources cleanup. As result we have to use unique names, ports and etc in a lot of tests. It makes support of tests a bit complicated.Â   This ticket is about refactoring of tests to perform full cleanup: 1. Avoid usage of long custom names. Just use pool1 or wallet1.

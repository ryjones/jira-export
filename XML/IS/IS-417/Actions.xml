CDATA  ~avkrishnan  This ticket needs to be prioritised. IS-574 is dependent on this ticket. zmq-pw was causing problems to be build when targeted for Android platform. To unblock me  ~sergey.minaev  switched from zmq-pw to zmq on his personal branch and I was able to proceed forward.  These changes need to carry forwarded to master in order to trigger android builds from master.  ></body> </Action>

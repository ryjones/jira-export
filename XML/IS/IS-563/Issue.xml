CDATA Indy Crypto should not operate whole object with all Tails. Right now it's RevocationRegistryPublic::tails. Instead of it, Crypto can consume callback to retrieve one tail by index when needed. Also Issuer::new_revocation_registry API will be affected. It may return public part of the registry without tails and also one more method for generating part of the tails is needed.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently we mix 2 concepts in libnullpay:  1. Behavior that emulates real payment system 2. Mocks  This solutions causes some technical and dev-UX problems:  - Mixing multiple conceptions - Non-obvious for developers - Cyclic dependencies - Over-complicated builds  We discussed the following solution:  1. Remove mocks functionality from libnullpay 2. Make libnullpay dedicated top level artifact 3. Move mocks to libindy tests 4. Adopt tests to use mocks  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As a researcher examining an Indy network, I want to verify that the signatures of ledger transactions are valid so that I can have confidence in the network's integrity.  *Acceptance Criteria* It should be programmatically possible to recreate the signature from the transaction and compare.  This is complicated because the transaction format is JSON, which does not enforce ordering. There should be a public API to access the system's custom serialization routine so that a consistent ordering is always used.  *Notes* * Indy Plenum's implementation is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/common/serializers/signing_serializer.py  * Indy SDK's implementation is behind a private API  ></description> </Issue>

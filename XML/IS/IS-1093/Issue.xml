CDATA As a result of investigation we found out that hex serialization and deserialization was working incorrect.  If we serialize some data on 64-bit platform and then try to deserialize and serialize it on 32-bit the source and the result won't be equal. The reason is that we serializing not the byte-representation of big number primitives but inner representation of AMCL (which is platform dependent). We made a decision to change the (de)serialization to byte-representation instead of inner representation.  What should be done: 1) Change the serialization (`from_hex` and `to_hex`) of BIG in AMCL 2) Fix tests in indy-crypto (update constants to fit into new format) 3) IndySDK tests should be updated if needed  ></description> </Issue>

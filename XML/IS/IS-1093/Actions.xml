CDATA This bug is in the upstream of AMCL. We are currently using an older version, so we will patch it in our version. Upgrading will require significant changes in how we use the library including a change in the serialization format.  Fixing this issue will obsolete existing revocation primitives such as registries, definitions, and proofs.   We are not aware of any application in production that currently uses revocation (though some are in development), and there are not any revocation registries on the live ledger.  We need to evaluate what it would take to migrate these revocation primitives for the user. * It is likely that it will only be possible to migrate the primitives on 64 bit platforms  ></body> </Action>

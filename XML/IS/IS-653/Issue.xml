CDATA We need to release new Libindy with: * Revocation * CLI * New crypto API * A lot of bugfixes  What we need for release: * Decide what version we need to release with Nathan: will be LibIndy 1.4 * Merge current opened PRs for documentation * Switch to Stable Node version * Update release notes ** This release is not recommended for use in production. We do not yet have a migration process between versions and we know wallet format changes are coming. ** Release notes need to clarify that anoncred format changed, and anoncreds have to be reissued. ** Release notes need to clarify that there will be format changes in LibIndy 1.5: plugable storage and new encryption format * Acceptance testing  Note: * Official publication of the release will wait until we have approval from Nathan.  ></description> </Issue>

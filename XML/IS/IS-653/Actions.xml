CDATA Updates: * The next release will be SDK 1.4, confirmed by Nathan on April 20. * This release will require new wallets, because of the support for credentials. There is not currently a migration to the new wallet format. * We want to postpone the release until the additional changes for the storage and encryption layers are completed because they will also impact wallet formats and we can manage that upgrade a single time. (See IS-654) * This story is to prepare a Beta Release for use by other development teams, but we will wait for the official release until the other changes to the wallet format are complete. We updated the title of the story.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA My apologies, but we are going to take another change in tactics: * After consultation with stakeholders, we are comfortable releasing SDK 1.4 even with the breaking changes to the wallet format. We will highlight in the release notes that persistent credentials should not be created until after the release of SDK 1.5. * This story is still to prepare the release, but not actually release it. The official release should wait for approval of stakeholders (Nathan and the Indy Working Group)  In the future, we will endeavor to plan sufficiently in advance so as not to change requirements at the last minute like this.  ></body> </Action>

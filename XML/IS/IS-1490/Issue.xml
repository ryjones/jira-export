CDATA If I use LibVCX to write a schema to the ledger that is identical to a schema that was already written with the same DID using the same name and version number, the following error is returned:  {code} { Error: Unknown Error at Function.<anonymous> (/vagrant/node_modules/node-vcx-wrapper/dist/api/schema.js:64:23) at Generator.throw (<anonymous>) at rejected (/vagrant/node_modules/node-vcx-wrapper/dist/api/schema.js:5:65) at <anonymous> inheritedStackTraces:   , vcxCode: 8888 } {code}  This error doesn't give me any hints about the cause of the problem.  Compare with the error returned by a duplicate credential definition: "Error: Can't create, Credential Def already on ledger"  ></description> </Issue>

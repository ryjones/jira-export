CDATA Hi all, indy-sdk's ZKP keeps failing on me when verifying a proof with negative values for both attribute value and the predicate value, e.g. -1 >= -2 fails when verifying the proof. With positive values there is no issue whatsoever. Also 2 >= -2 works fine.  Asked to post this as a bug by  ~sergey.minaev   ></description> </Issue>

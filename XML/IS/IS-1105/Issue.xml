CDATA I have repeatedly run into ItemNotFound errors when using indy-sdk. Most recently when accidently using a key which is not actually in the wallet.   ItemNotFound is not very informative and investigating such bugs always starts with figuring out what type of item is actually being looked up.  My proposal is to add the type in the WalletError::ItemNotFound and add it on by mapping the error in the WalletService.  Perhaps it's also useful in case of ItemAlreadyExists.  I'd be happy to implement and contribute this, but I would like some feedback on whether this would be useful, or if there are any aspects that I'm missing.  More possibly unclear errors: - CommonInvalidStructure: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-sdk?msg=xop9z2ryG6smoazqi  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA How do I update a pairwise did/verkey association in a wallet? I can call `did.store_their_did()` to set one in the first place. Now suppose the other party rekeys and I want to update the association in my wallet, or else I just fat-fingered it somehow. Calling it again with a new identify using the same DID but a new verkey raises a uniqueness exception as expected, but I don't see a way to delete or overwrite such an association.  The non_secrets API can handle all that pairwise can, plus updating/deleting and WQL searching by tags. My preference would be to get rid of pairwise, but that appears to be a minority opinion. Including functionality to update, replace, delete pairwise non_secrets via the pairwise API would suffice, while presenting (puzzling, to newcomers) redundancy with non_secrets.  For the moment, the non_secrets API offers a workaround.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="57546" issue="37337" author="sklump" type="comment" body="I&apos;ve changed my mind on retaining pairwise: in the interest of inter-implementation compatibility, having a single pairwise front-end to the non_secrets API could add significant value; this implementation would handle all values and metadata the same for everyone rather than allowing idiosyncracies to act as an incompatibility factory. For example, my own implementation repeats their_verkey and their_did into the tags, plus an epoch time, for potential WQL search." created="2019-02-25 14:24:44.0" updateauthor="sklump" updated="2019-02-25 14:24:44.0"/>

CDATA Thank   ~sklump   for the suggestion. This capability must exist. Allow updating of  an existing `their DID` record on `indy_store_their_did` function looks reasonable and safe. I didn't find any important side effects and risks after codebase investigation. I did changes in the PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2035     ></body> </Action>

CDATA h3. * lodo1995|https://github.com/lodo1995 * commented  on Apr 19|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/issues/663#issue-315977922  |According to the  indy-node readme|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/#dependent-projects , the indy-sdk cli should replace the indy-node cli. But, looking at  the source of the former|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/indy_client/cli/command.py#L18 ,  the source of the latter|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/src/main.rs#L55  and  the design document of the latter|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/cli-design.md#commands , it appears that the indy-sdk cli is still missing many functions. I found  a jira issue about the overall switch between the two clis|https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/IS/issues/IS-380?filter=allopenissues , but I didn't manage to understand whether the missing commands will be implemented and, if so, whether they will be available soon or require some more time.|  ></description> </Issue>

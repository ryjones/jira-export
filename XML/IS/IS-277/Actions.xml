CDATA Agent was configured and attached to jenkins server as *win2016-01* with label *win2016*.  I've tested and verified that Jenkins is able to connect and run docker commands there.  Also there is an updated windows2016 AMI on Amazon AWS which could be used for new agents rapid launching.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It is an error to have a proof request with the same attribute as both a requested attribute and a requested predicate.   The error is as follows: ``` File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/indy/anoncreds.py", line 1239, in prover_create_proof prover_create_proof.cb) indy.error.IndyError: (<ErrorCode.CommonInvalidStructure: 113>, "Error: Invalid structure\n  Caused by: IndyCryptoError: Value by key 'dob_timestamp' not found in eq_proof.mtilde\n") ```  This is a cryptic error and should be improved so that it is understandable by the person who created the proof request.  ></description> </Issue>

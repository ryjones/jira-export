CDATA *Task Overview* Libindy requires custom code to handle StateProofs for each Node request.  Payments transactions will require StateProofs, but will be unknown for libindy. So we need to be able to plug code that handles StateProofs to libindy.  Exact behavior must be defined as design part of this task.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Design is done (exact behavior is defined) * Corresponded code is written * Integration tests are written and passed * Code is merged and master build with the changes is issued  ></description> </Issue>

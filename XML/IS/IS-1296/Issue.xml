CDATA Dependabot was acquired by Github and is now free.  It looks at a repo's dependencies and creates PRs when there is a newer version of a dependencies.  The maximum number of PRs at one time is 5 so maintainers don't get overwhelmed.  To exclude a PR just comment `{{@dependabot ignore this dependency}}` on the relevant Dependabot PR.     Here is a valid .dependabot/config.yml  https://github.com/AxelNennker/indy-sdk/blob/master/.dependabot/config.yml     ></description> </Issue>

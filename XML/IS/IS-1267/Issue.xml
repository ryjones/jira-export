CDATA # _Environment_:  ## Ubuntu 16.04 ## indy-cli v1.8.3 # _Steps to Reproduce_: After having indy-cli open, wallet open, using a did that is anchored as a nym, and connected to the pool with the nym. Issue a NYM command to update the current did being used with a new verkey. for example *ledger nym did=pVBbBKqVkQDhuVm4r9qNqp verkey=~JapuLZRnHoWL8hz8cVwyYA role=* # _Expected Behavior_: warning or error, describing that the anchored did will have a verkey that the current wallet does not own.  # _Observed Behavior_: nym request has been sent to ledger. successfully changing the nym verkey to a verkey the wallet does not own, rendering that nym useless to the owner.   # _Notes_: this allows a steward or trustee an easy copy paste mistake when anchoring new dids, that can render their did useless to the ledger.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA vcx does not treat wallet handles as opaque.  vcx assumes that zero is an invalid wallet handle and that a value greater than zero is a valid wallet handle.  If libindy decides to e.g. start counting wallet handles at MIN_INT then the vcx code is wrong.   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/libvcx/src/api/vcx.rs#L109      vcx should use the type WalletHandle for all wallet handles and the constant INVALID_WALLET_HANDLE for a invalid value.  Currently a wallet handle in vcx is a u32 which makes some gymnastics necessary to convert it to i32 - that would be avoided as well when the type WalletHandle is used.     This PR handles this. Please review.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1877  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Wallet key for now can't be generated on application side and we need some way to achieve this. I see the following options:  1. indy_create_wallet() instead of consuming key can consume optional seed and return the key 2. We can add dedicated call indy_create_wallet_key() 3. We can generate the key based on pass phrase  Note that only passphrase support will allow to avoid breaking changes  *Acceptance Criteria* * Design is done (exact behavior is defined) * Corresponded code is written * Integration tests are written and passed * Code is merged and master build with the changes is issued * iOS, Java, Python wrappers updated * Community is requested to update NodeJS and .Net wrappers  * Documentation is updated  ></description> </Issue>

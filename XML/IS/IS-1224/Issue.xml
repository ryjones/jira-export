CDATA In working through the DIDComm Credential Exchange HIPE, we noticed that the process of creating a Credential Request includes a field "did_prover".  Based on our knowledge of how the Credential Exchange protocol works, the inclusion of a/the DID of the prover does not make sense.     I did some tracing through the indy-sdk code and other than being checked for being a valid DID in the  prover create_credential_request ( https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/eb7ea544ae8616883c6011a57d40f1b14cd5afeb/libindy/src/commands/anoncreds/prover.rs#L252)  call, I doubt very much the field is ever used within the SDK.  From what I could tell, it's not used it all in the  issuer new_credential (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/16bb0666ede6750639b7a2c65294397b01155e0f/libindy/src/services/anoncreds/issuer.rs#L83) code, which makes sense.     If the field is being used, it would be very important to know how it is being used, to make sure that developers know what DID to put into the field.     If (as we suspect) the field is not being used, I'm not quite sure what is the best way to eliminate this from the code or at least to let developers know what should be used.  I've seen that it is confusing for a dev to figure out what DID to use when none make sense (at least on the surface). Presumably, they use the prover's pairwise DID for their relationship with the Issuer, but that could not be used for anything that a verifier might need to know.  ></description> </Issue>

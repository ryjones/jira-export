CDATA I ran your project on my machine and `verify` function returned false as is expected. I added the test to our Java wrapper. This test is a copy of your example (I only skipped wallet and pool preparation and added assetFalse after verifying).  Here is PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1911 CI build was passed successfully.  ~jsh4rk  Could you share some details regarding your environment?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Reason:   JNA considers boolean to be 4 bytes when the C99/Rust bool is 1 byte. When functions return false JNA considers it like some wrong value (for example `507892224`) that isn't equal to `0` (false expected).  This reason the result of functions that return boolean value always was true.   Changes: added custom mapper of byte value to boolean.

CDATA @ ~Artemkaaas  I used docker and the published docker-image to run Indy on a windows 10 machine. Also I used the indy sdk 1.90. If the problem lies in the encoding of the booleans, shouldn't I nevertheless get an answer from the indy-network, that the credential has been revoked (value of revoked in the readRevocationDelta response message) ?      ></body> </Action>

CDATA - GetRevocDelta request returns aggregated value.  After you did credential issuing delta will contain issued:  1 , revoked     - If you send GetRevocDelta request to Ledger before revocation it will also contain issued  1 , revoked     - After you did revocation delta will contain issued:   , revoked  1 ,  - But if you request delta from ledger after revocation it will be aggregated and will look like in the initial state issued:   , revoked     ></body> </Action>

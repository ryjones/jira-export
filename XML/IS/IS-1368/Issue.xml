CDATA I noticed the following problem. Despite the revocation of a credential a proof gets verified to true. Here is a small project, with which the behavior can be traced:   https://github.com/jSh4rk/IndyProofIssue2—Revocation|http://example.com   I noticed that the DL does not return any revoked credentials in {{the Ledger.buildGetRevocRegDeltaRequest}}  response message. The behavior remains the same whether the time delta is 0 (from = to) or greater than 0 (from < to).     ></description> </Issue>

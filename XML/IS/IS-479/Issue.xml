CDATA Case 1: Commands should not be completed if there is wrong word before command. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type any word differ from top level commands and from command group. G.g. `new`. 2. Type space and press Tab key.  Actual Results: Autocomplete offers all top level commands and command groups. User may think that `new` is valid command because autocomplete worked for it.  Expected Results: Autocomplete should not work if there is wrong word before command.  Case 2: Autocomplete should work for correct commands without typing space after command. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type any valid command (e.g. `did`), do not autocomplete it during typing and do not type space after command. 2. Press Tab key.  Actual Results: Nothing happened.  Expected Result:  Space should be added, second Tab press should offer command parameters.  ></description> </Issue>

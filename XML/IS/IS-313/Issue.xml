CDATA Functional testing is performed before artifacts packaging. libindy has some runtime dependencies and we need to be sure that package installation satisfy this dependencies.  I suggest the following: * Create simple demo projects on C, Python and Java that will depend on libindy artifacts and move our demo tests to these projects (in the future we need projects for iOS, .Net and NodeJS). We can try to do this in the current sprint. * Test libibindy and wrapper installation on ubuntu and windows (in the future on macos, rhel, iOS too) * Test that these demo projects can be built and run with rc packages  1. Python project is the first priority 2. Java wrapper is the second priority 3. ะก is optional for now as libindy packages will be checked by Python and Java projects too.   ></description> </Issue>

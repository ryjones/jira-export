CDATA Build Info: indy-cli 1.6.4~740  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create logger config file with invalid field: {noformat} # Scan this file for changes every 30 seconds refresh_rate: 30 seconds  appenders: indy_cli: additive: false kind: file path: "log/indy_cli.log" append: false encoder: pattern: "{d}  {t}  {l} {M}:{m}{n}"  root: level: trace appenders: - indy_cli {noformat} 2. Run indy-cli with logger.  Actual Results: White-colored poorly readable error string about unknown field in config file and green string about successful logger initialization. Log file is not created actually.  Expected Results: Error strings should be red. Maybe it should not be a successful initialization text since logger actually doesn't produce any logs in this case.  ></description> </Issue>

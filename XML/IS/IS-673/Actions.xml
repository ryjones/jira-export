CDATA  ~mdb  I suggest the following:  Stop and remove all containers and images related to indy and start from scratch. indy-pool dockerfile contains pool_ip argument.   As we can see your pool is configured to listen 127.0.0.1 that is incorrect configuration for getting started environment.   before you start again run ```docker ps -a``` and ```docker images```.  Check that there are no any indy related containers and images.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Right now there is no proof of correctness for revocation key creation like there currently is for primary credential keys.  This is important because it helps Holders to know that the Issuer cannot compute the discrete log of the generators. If Issuers could, they can change which attribute is at a given position and commit to different values and otherwise be malicious.  This needs to happen before production.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Reason: Pytest execution thread completes before Libvcx Threadpool.  For some reason, `Drop` is never called for Threadpool. Possible, there is the same problem in Libindy.  Changes: Updated `vcx_shutdown` API function to wait for Threadpool shutdown. Fixed for Libvcx in PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1329/    ></body> </Action>

CDATA This solution didn't help. PR has been closed. The only solution for the current moment is adding of `shutdown` function in Libindy API.  Libvx already has this function, so we just need to add shutdowning of ThreadPool. We created a separate ticket for it: IS-1107  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I was finally able to spend time on Friday and today to check whether or not this was fixed and it is NOT fixed. As soon as I enable the logging code here –  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/libvcx/src/utils/logger.rs#L66  – for Android then the Connect.Me mobile app crashes over and over again on every hydration of the mobile apps state which uses the logging during an 1073 libvcx error which triggers the callback within a callback and subsequently the crash. You can see this behavior for your self by installing Connect.Me for Android from here –  https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/apps/867464/app_versions/324  (1.0.65-95312 for Android). After you install that version of Connect.Me for Android and attempt to add a connection and then a credential and then close down the app (or put the app in the background) and send a push notification then you will see the app crash.  The fix that was put into Libindy.java and Libvcx.java was to simply invoke  com.sun.jna.Native.detach(false) just before logging to the logger. I am not sure how this was tested to verify that it might be a fix for this issue but my testing does not show that the issue is fixed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I don't have access to  https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/apps/867464/app_versions/324 What Liibndy/wrapper version does Connect.me use?  last stable?  I was testing on the `indy-prototype ` project that is attached to IS-1229. I also updated it to depend on vcx and added the test which does steps as in the description of this ticket.  Could you run `indy-prototype` also (with changed indy dependency) to check if we have the same problem for both projects or different?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="64296" issue="39573" author="nsivraj" type="comment" body=" ~Artemkaaas  I need to add further testing results to this ticket. I have spent the last few days working to reproduce the same conditions that were causing Android to crash previously. In working to reproduce the exact same test scenarios I was able to verify that the logging fix – com.sun.jna.Native.detach(false) just before logging to the logger – actually DOES fix the Android logging issue. It took me a while to discover that the reason our Android Connect.Me app was crashing this time was due to the incorrect configuration of the {{RNFirebaseBackgroundMessagingService}} that was in our AndroidManifest.xml file. After fixing this incorrect setting now our Android Connect.Me app does not crash and the logging is turned on and we get all of the detailed logs from the rust code (libvcx and libindy). I am marking the ticket back to complete." created="2019-10-03 21:35:13.0" updateauthor="nsivraj" updated="2019-10-03 21:40:32.0"/>

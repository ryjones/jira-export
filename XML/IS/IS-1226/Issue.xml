CDATA Documentation per README (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md) for windows says:  *After unzip you will get next structure of files: Your working directory include ... lib indy.dll libeay32md.dll libsodium.dll libzmq.dll ssleay32md.dll include contains c-header files which contains all necessary declarations that may be need for your applications.  lib contains all necessary binaries which contains libindy and all it's dependencies. You must add to PATH environment variable path to lib. It's necessary for dynamic linkage your application with libindy.*  however, if you look at the zip file of what is produced by the build (eg: https://repo.sovrin.org/windows/libindy/master/1.8.2-1048/) the lib folder and include folder are missing.  *Expected behavior*: the lib folder and include folder are included in the zip  *Actual results*: the lib folder and include folder are missing.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Improve indy-sdk experience on fedora through adding it to the CD Pipeline and improving build instructions.     Description of process from  ~andkononykhin : {quote}We discussed the topic with the sdk team. Seems for now it's better to split Fedora support into two major steps (two separate PRs):  1. Prepare necessary infrastructure     - prepare Fedora-based `dockerfile` like these:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/libindy/ci .     As of now the same dockerfile is used for both CI and CD (packaging).     - add RPM specs (done as you said)     - test everything locally     - update docs with information on how to test on and package for Fedora (seems you have already created a related PR)  2. Update CI/CD pipelines     - CI  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.ci      - CD  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.cd   The second step will have to be postponed until we overcome issues with performance on Jenkins agents we currently have. It would be great if you create the PR for that as well but it is not going to be merged until mentioned issues are resolved. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

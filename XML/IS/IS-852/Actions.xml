CDATA  ~esplinr   Some notes here:  - We don't have any Hyperlegder CI infrastructure for SDK builds for the moment. All SDK builds are performed on Evernym infrastructure. - I believe it is better to include VCX build to existing SDK pipeline. At least for the beginning steps.  - For "release" builds i suggest to re-use existing SDK release process and the same logic of tagging and GH release publishing. For now we provide tags for accepted builds only and update GH manually. - For SDK pipeline we have dedicated CI build branches for RHEL and Ubuntu.   As a scope for this ticket i suggest the following:  - CI/CD branches for Ubuntu 16.4 provided for libvcx that share existing SDK CI/CD process - CI/CD should execute part of vcx tests that doesn't require Evernym infrastructure  ></body> </Action>

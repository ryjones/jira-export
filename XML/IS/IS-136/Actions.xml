CDATA > 1)Â Get binary dependencies (libamcl*, openssl, libsodium, libzmq, sqlite3): Need a location to store these dependencies, then the link should be published here.  We spent a lot of time to build some dependencies as there is no native MSVC support for some. So i suggest not only provide the link to binaries, but also document how to build each dependency or get it from public source.  Actually it is part of IS-64 ticket. I will link this issues.  ></body> </Action>

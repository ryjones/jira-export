CDATA *Story* As a developer building an Enterprise Agent, LibIndy should be as useful for my project as it is when building a Consumer Agent in order to reduce the cost of getting my project live on an Indy network.  Key differences between an Enterprise and Consumer Agent: * Enterprise Agents communicate with lots of other agents in parallel. * Enterprise Agents need to segment secrets from a large number of individuals (i.e. multiple wallets)  *Acceptance Criteria* * High performance: needs to handle lots of transactions in multiple threads * Scale-able secret storage: backed by a database TODO: What other deficiencies exist?  ></description> </Issue>

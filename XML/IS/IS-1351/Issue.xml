CDATA Build Info: libindy 1.11.0~1244 libsovtoken 1.0.1~80  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Build schema txn by identity owner. 2. Add fees to txn. 3. Append endorser to txn.  Actual Results: There is an endorser and no fees in txn after Step 3 but if you append endorser first and then add fees txn will contain both fields.  Expected Results: Client (libindy/CLI) should handle this situation and at least warn user about removing anything from request by another actions.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA For the moment libindy has different waiting timeout values for NACK/ACK and REPLY responses, but returns the same ret code - pool timeout error.  It would be better to create different ret codes for cases NACK/ACK received or not. Absence of NACK/ACK response for write txn most likely means that pool have not received request at all and client app should resend the same req. If ACK were received but REPLY timeout expired client could send just read req to find out whether it were written or not  ></description> </Issue>

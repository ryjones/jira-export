CDATA *Task Overview* For the moment if there is no answer to some catch-up requests libindy just blacklists corresponded nodes and starts catch-up form scratch, but with reduced amount of nodes (request bigger chunks). It is obviously can cause multiple requests to all nodes during catch-up.   It will be much more efficient to re-request only missed catch-up chunks.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Corresponded code is written * Integration tests are written and passed * Code is merged and master build with the changes is issued   Note:  It can be efficient to implement together with IS-570  ></description> </Issue>

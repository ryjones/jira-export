CDATA For current moment we decide to change SDK behavior in catch-up process: client will try to get all transactions from single node, if the request is failed, client will re-send it to the next one. Node ledger is enough small now and such catch-up reply is fit into 1 reply from the Node. As we will have multiply clients at the same time for real network, this approach will reduce global load for nodes.  ></body> </Action>

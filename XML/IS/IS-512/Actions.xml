CDATA I think we should have an assumption to be able to have just one CLAIM_DEF (that is a key) for an ISSUER_DID. If one needs to rotate a key, a new DID must be used. It means that ISSUER_DID is rather a CLAIM_DEF's DID (or key's DID). So, we must check if there is already a CLAIM_DEF for a Schema-DID pair, and not allow to override it on ledger. We now do the same for Schema (that is we can not override Schema with the existent name-version-origin triple).  So, we should do the following: 1) libindy: do not allow to create and override CLAIM_DEF in the wallet for already existent schem-did pair; 2) indy-node: do not allow to override CLAIM_DEF on ledger for already existent schem-did pair; 3) indy-node: update docs and diagrams so that it's clear it's not possible to create multiple CLAIM_DEFS for the same schema-did pair.  ></body> </Action>

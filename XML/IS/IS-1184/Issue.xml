CDATA Using Libvcx python wrapper, I am provisioning two connections.  Each time I call vcx_init or vcx_init_with_config, I see the following error message appear in my console output.  The error is repeated for each demoted node and each connection.  There are several demoted nodes in our pool, so I see dozens of these in my console.   {code:java} src/services/pool/merkle_tree_factory.rs:50 | Cache is invalid -- dropping it! src/services/pool/pool.rs:675 | Error during retrieving nodes: IndyError { inner:  Node is not a validator  Invalid library state } src/services/pool/pool.rs:675 | Error during retrieving nodes: IndyError { inner:  Node is not a validator  Invalid library state } {code}  Expected: I do not need to see this output in the console.  This message should be an info not an error  ></description> </Issue>

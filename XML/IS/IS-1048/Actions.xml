CDATA  ~ianco  We don't want to expose any low-level plugin methods in wrappers. Plugins should be written in C or any language that should allow to build dll/so with C-compatible code.   Each plugin should provide *init_* function that will call register_wallet_storage internally.   What we may want to reduce boilerplate is to provide call *load_plugin(path, init_fn_name)* in python wrapper.  ></body> </Action>

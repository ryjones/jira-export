Not sure about their float encoding as I think that ife1 = encode(float1) and e2 = encode(float2) and float1 &gt; float2 thenNumber(e1) &gt; Number(e2) etcOf course all wrappers should use the same encoding or use a Rust implementation which is not 100% correct to put into libindy...Should this be introduced then all examples should be changed..." priority="3" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2018-09-18 17:34:51.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:57:31.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:57:31.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="51569"/>

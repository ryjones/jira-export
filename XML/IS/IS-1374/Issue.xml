CDATA Hi,  Â   Could someone help me, for the past 2 days I've been trying to install the indy-sdk for nodejs using npm but it fails everytime node-gyp tries to rebuild the files. I've attached the logs.  I'd highly appreciate someone to help me point out where I'm going wrong. I have the libindy dll's installed correctly and the path to the cli folder added to the environment variables.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="28177" issue="19117" author="peacekeeper" type="comment" body="Well i wanted to make sure all Java method names match exactly the libindy method names. It seems straightforward to e.g. use &quot;connect&quot; instead of &quot;agentConnect&quot; in Java, but then e.g. would I also use &quot;open&quot; instead of &quot;openWallet&quot;, and would I use &quot;open&quot; instead of &quot;openPoolLedger&quot;? This mapping of method names would not be 100% deterministic and may be inconsistent between different wrappers?" created="2017-07-11 19:22:53.0" updateauthor="peacekeeper" updated="2017-07-11 19:22:53.0"/>

Let's leave existing methods naming schema. I will use the same approach for Python wrapper am working on.        ></body> </Action>

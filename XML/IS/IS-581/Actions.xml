CDATA  ~gudkov , as you can see in batches, it fails in two possible cases: in line 12 or in line 18.  {code:java} line11: ledger nym did=NyLkggDnCtZY6ngkfNqzg2 verkey=~LTar8Y3uzcQEt3HdhgqtSz line12: ledger get-nym did=NyLkggDnCtZY6ngkfNqzg2 ... line18: ledger get-nym did=NyLkggDnCtZY6ngkfNqzg2{code} In case of failure on line 18, first get-nym worked successfully. So, failed get-nym was send not right after sending nym.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It is expected RBFT protocol behavior. We suggest the following workaround:  - Ignore result of get-nym transactions in acceptance scripts - Check output and expected output diffs  - If get-nym failed than re-send it manually after finishing of acceptance script  We have an idea how to improve this and created corresponded ticket https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-602  ></body> </Action>

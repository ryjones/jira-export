CDATA *Description*  There is an inconsistency between how the CLI is used to make a new DID versus how to make a new Payment Address. * Creating a DID uses the syntax: "did new" * Creating a Payment Address uses the syntax: "payment-address create"  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/007-cli-payments   *Suggested Remediation*  It would be easier for users to remember if they both use the same syntax. Given that payment-addresses are newer, and not widely used, I suggest changing that to match DID creation.  At this time, payment-addresses are not widely used in any deployment of Indy. So we can drop the legacy syntax of "payment-address create" when we change it to "payment-address new".  *Notes* * We discussed the trade-offs between the term "new" and "create". "Create" suggests that work will be done outside the wallet, on the ledger. Whereas "New" suggests that all the work to define the object will be done locally and not impact external systems.  ></description> </Issue>

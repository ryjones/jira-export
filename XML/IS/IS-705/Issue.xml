CDATA *Task Overview* For the moment after calling indy_pool_open libindy keeps all Nodes sockets open until calling indy_pool_close. The most of existing apps keep pool opened, but send transactions very rarely.   It will cause keeping unnecessary connections on Indy Pool side. We need to close sockets if there are no requests to the pool. Also it can be good to don't perform to the whole pool is request allows getting StateProof.  Exact behavior must be defined as design part of this task.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Design is done (exact behavior is defined) * Corresponded code is written * Integration tests are written and passed * Code is merged and master build with the changes is issued  ></description> </Issue>

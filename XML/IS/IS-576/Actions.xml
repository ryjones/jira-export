CDATA I was able to cross-compile libindy for arm64/aarch64 on OSX but same build configuration does not seem to work on Ubuntu. The problem is while native compiling one of the dependency i.e libzmq. It seems this is an open issue. Same issues are recorded in following tickets in zmq repo   https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1063   https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2894   ></body> </Action>

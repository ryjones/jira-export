CDATA When iOS apps requiring that bitcode enabled attempt to link with the libindy Cocoapod, the following error is received:  '/Users/XXXXX/Documents/Anonyome/indy-sdk/wrappers/ios/libindy-pod/Pods/libindy/libindy.a(indy.i6r5owmqkyk7fd9.rcgu.o)' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. for architecture arm64  After a bit of research, I discovered that the Rust compiler didn't support enabling bitcode until about March 2018.  However, a test of simply updating the rust compiler did not fix the link error.    In one newsgroup, it was recommended to enable a compiler option (RUSTFLAGS="-C llvm-args=\"-fembed-bitcode\"") to enable bitcode compatibility.  I have not yet tested this option.  For iOS apps requiring bitcode functionality, it does not seem possible to link in the libindy Cocoapod.  If someone knows of process that is able to enable bitcode functionality for libindy, I would very much appreciate learning the sequence.  ></description> </Issue>

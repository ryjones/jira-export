CDATA *Story*  As a trustee of an Indy network, I need to be able to use my hexadecimal seed created with the legacy python CLI on the new CLI to import my existing keys into a new wallet. My hexadecimal seed contains unprintable characters, and so cannot be represented as ASCII.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Use the legacy CLI to create a seed containing non-printable characters encoded as 64 bytes of hexadecimal. * The new CLI should accept the seed through the command line (not a configuration file)  *Notes* * Why don't they just upgrade their wallet? Some trustees did not create a wallet. They created and stored their seed without creating a wallet. So they need to provide a seed to perform actions such as changing IP addresses or adding new trustees or stewards.  ></description> </Issue>

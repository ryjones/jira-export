CDATA Changes:  - We updated our CI/CD pipelines to run libindy tests with pool in the scope of IS-192. CI launches only high cases of libindy tests.  CD launches all tests. All pool related tests passed during CD including `medium_cases::open::open_pool_ledger_works_after_error`. So, there is no regression. Looks like you have an issue with the environment.

CDATA Creating a new wallet for a registered custom wallet type still creates a directory named for the wallet in the .indy directory as it would if the wallet was being created for the "default" wallet type.   This poses a problem as any attempt to create a new wallet with the same name will fail with a 203 error code as attempting to create a new custom wallet also checks whether the directory exists, where as not all wallets care about the directory (e.g. InMemWalletType)     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As of now there is no way to know what is the current status of a pool.   It might be created and you can open it but we dont know so we might try to create it first and that operation fails.  It might not be open and we try to refresh/close it and that operation might also fail.  Similarly we might want to delete it and it might not be close so the operation will fail.  Instead of trying to do error based coded, it would be better if we had a api that returned the current pool status and if it is open its handle also so it can be used for appropriate further action.             ></description> </Issue>

CDATA An API exists to force a refresh of the pool state. Work to document that API and have an automatic refresh of the pool will be tracked as IS-1243. This story is about detecting stale handles in the library state.  We don't have a need for this API call at this time, and haven't received external requests for this functionality. So we will resolve this as "deferred", but encourage interested people to reopen this story if they would find it valuable enough to implement it.  ></body> </Action>

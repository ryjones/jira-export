CDATA I think it would be prudent for SDK documentation to be available online.  Each SDK function should be described on a page with a unique hyperlink and should include information about calling conventions, parameters, a summary and descriptive information about it's usage, purpose, etc.  .My thinking is that wrapper documentation should be generated from code docs for languages that support them (e.g. Java, .NET).  The wrapper documentation should focus on behavior specific to the wrapper and more detailed documentation should referenced via hyperlink to the corresponding SDK functionality in order to avoid duplication of effort.  Versioning should also be considered as it is likely that different versions of the SDK and corresponding wrappers will be available concurrently and the documentation for each specific version should remain current.  Management of the linkage between specific versions of the wrapper docs and the SDK docs would should also be taken into account.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Existing documentation isn't very well structured. We need to provide:  1. Resonable structure. It can possible to move some documents between root folder, libindy and wrappers  2. Links to sovrin that can help to undertand workflow  3. High level documentation of API parts, links to documentation in code  4.

CDATA *Story* As a developer building an application that uses LibIndy, if I try to submit a DID to the wallet that already exists, I want the wallet to return a handle to the DID instead of issuing me an error.  Or at least give me a hint as to how to get the DID out of the wallet.  ></description> </Issue>

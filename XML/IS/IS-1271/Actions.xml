CDATA I addressed one of the complex type warnings. The type`Box<dyn Fn(IndyResult<(String, String)>) + Send>)` is now named BoxedCallbackStringStringSend.  This is part of this PR  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1827   I did not address the other warnings because this clippy issue is about readability which is not really an issue in general.  We would have to define a type for each callback, that is for every combination of results. This would reduce readability, I think.  We could address the  warning be adding `# warn(clippy::type_complexity) `   https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#allowingdenying-lints      ></body> </Action>

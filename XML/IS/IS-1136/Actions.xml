Thanks for raising the issue. We'll keep it in mind as we look to improve the wallet.  We would be happy to discuss strategies with anyone wanting to work on it before we get to it.  ></body> </Action>

It's rather tricky.  Because a wallet can exist at any location on the system, we can't really list all available wallets.  One can test if a wallet exists by doing a file system lookup on the path where the wallet is stored, but one would have to guess the format of the file name of the wallet or use a private-API.  The error is emitted to the log when the wallet creation fails, regardless of whether the exception is caught. One could override the logger, but that would be ugly.  We could potentially improve the situation by having APIs that: * Test whether a wallet can be successfully created with the provided name * Lists all wallets in a directory provided by the user (with the same default directory as the wallet creation API * Provides a list of open wallets.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA At present, there is no way to check whether a wallet exists on a given name. The only thing to do is to try to create a wallet and catch the exception when libindy discovers that it already exists, but this produces an ugly ERROR log.  Libinndy node pool code allows the caller to detect when a creation is necessary, via list_pools(). Node pools are always on disk where wallet operations depend on the wallet type, so is not as straightforward, but I think there should always be a way to tell if a wallet exists on a given name.  ></description> </Issue>

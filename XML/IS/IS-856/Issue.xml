CDATA We need a schema.rs in indy-sdk that helps people work with schema.  The first functions that we should provide are those that transform scalar values into encoded values suitable for inclusion in a CL-signed anoncreds-style credential. For example, we need one or more functions that transform dates into a 256-bit integer â€“ possibly one that has nanosecond precision, one that has second precision, one that has day-only precision. We also need encoding functions that transform floating point into 256-bit integers, functions that transform strings (e.g., into a sha256 hash), etc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thank you  ~andrey.goncharov  for raising this question. It resulted in a few rounds of interesting conversation. We agree that we should require exact matches in attribute names and proofs.  Reasons for requiring an exact match: * Case conversion is locale dependent (Spain preserves accents in uppercase, but Mexico does not) * When in doubt, we should not match  Additional future work should include tooling to do fuzzy matches in the wallet query language, and tools to help developers create useful attribute names (such as strip out white space).  ></body> </Action>

Now a proof request template was created with attribute name as &quot;id&quot; i.e in lower case. The issue is that in connect.me, the attribute does not throw any error or gets autofilled. Rather that proof request becomes invalid or not usable since the SEND button in proof request UI remains disabled." priority="2" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2018-07-30 08:27:30.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:57:27.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:57:27.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="51475"/>

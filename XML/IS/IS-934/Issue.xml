CDATA Vcx now performs compile time linking with libindy payment plugin. It supports sovtoken and nullpay as compilation options. We canâ€™t use sovtoken in community repo and libnullpay is only for testing. As result community vcx is useless from payments point of view. We need allow developers to use different payment plugins without touching of vcx source code and build configuration.  *Solution*  * Payment plugin linking and initialization should be responsibility of application * As payment logic is hidden inside of vcx workflow we can allow configuration of what plugin should be used by providing additional option in vcx_init() * For the future consider to make payment making and verification functionality as a dedicated step in API   ></description> </Issue>

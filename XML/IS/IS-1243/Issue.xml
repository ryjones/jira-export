CDATA *Story* As a developer building an application for an Indy network that is expected to run continuously for a long time, I want to be able to force an update of the list of active nodes in the pool so that I keep valid connections without having to restart libindy.  Specific use cases include hosted services which could have  very long uptimes.  *Acceptance Criteria* * LibIndy should automatically update the pool list on a configurable frequency. * It should be possible to disable the automatic update. * An API command exists which will cause libindy to re-synchronize the pool list. * The process needs to be documented.  *Notes* * Would client application developers prefer to manage the cron for automatic updates in their application instead of having libindy do it?  ></description> </Issue>

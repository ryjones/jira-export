CDATA listMyDidsWithMeta API executes SQLs internally; they areÂ executed in a loop of list_my_dids_with_meta() in src/commands/did.rs, a loop which traverses DIDs. Then the number of SQLs is mainly proportional to the number of DIDs stored in the specified wallet; actually twice as much as the number of DIDs.  The current program can execute many SQLs and can cause a performance problem especially when using Postgres Plug-In; it's response time is greater than that of SQLite.  You can improve the performance by executing the SQL outside of the loop and make mappings corresponding to the current SQLs.  ></description> </Issue>

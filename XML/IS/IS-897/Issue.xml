CDATA For the current moment wallet create/open/delete/export/import functions consume passphrase and perform key derivation with aragon2i/aragon2m.  Depending on hardware aragon2 can require significant time for key derivation and significantly reduce performance of mobile and especially enterprise agents.  Key derivation isn't needed if key (or passphrase for now) is stored in secure enclave that is a common case for mobile and especially enterprise agents.  I suggest the following:  1. Move key derivation to the dedicated endpoint: indy_derive_wallet_key(config) -> key 2. config will allow to choice between different derivation methods (random/aragon2i/aragon2m) 3. Force create/open/delete/export/import functions to consume raw key instead of passphrase 4. Indy CLI should provide an option to choice key derriviation method (raw, argon2i, argon2m)   Acceptance criteria: - Changes implemented in libindy and python/java/iOS/nodejs wrappers - Documentation updated - Migration guide updated - Test procedure updated  Â   ></description> </Issue>

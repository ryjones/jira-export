CDATA First of all, there is some general work to be done: 1) Integration tests are mixed with unit tests. So the logic of initialization for tests is mixed. We should move integration tests into the `tests` directory and leave unit tests in the source code. It needs to be added, integration tests often marked as  2) Most of the tests don't have negative cases. We need much more of them. 3) Tests need to be separated by functionality they test – if we test some public function it should all be placed in one module (named after that functionality) (Optional) 4) It might be useful to separate them into additional high-level modules called `medium_cases` and `high_cases` to separate their level of severity.  Now to exact places that are not tested thoroughly: 1) connection * vcx_connection_create_with_invite * vcx_connection_invite_details  2) credential * vcx_credential_get_payment_info  3) disclosed_proof * vcx_disclosed_proof_update_state  4) issuer_credential * vcx_issuer_credential_update_state  5) wallet * vcx_wallet_update_record_tags * vcx_wallet_add_record_tags * vcx_wallet_delete_record_tags * vcx_wallet_open_search * vcx_wallet_search_next_records * vcx_wallet_search_next_records * vcx_wallet_close_search * vcx_wallet_validate_payment_address  Moreover there are some functions with no implementation: * vcx_issuer_get_credential_request * vcx_issuer_accept_credential * vcx_issuer_terminate_credential  Other notices: * vcx_get_logger -- this function is not needed in VCX at all.     ></body> </Action>

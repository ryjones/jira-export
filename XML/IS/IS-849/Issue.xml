CDATA *Story* As a developer of solutions on an Indy network, I want a high level API for exchanging credentials so that it is easier to build applications that consume those credentials.  *Acceptance Criteria* * A HIPE exists explaining libvcx and how it fits into the project * The Evernym Credential Exchange Library (libvcx) here: http://github.com/evernym/sdk Should be part of the Indy SDK * It will live within the Indy SDK GitHub repository: http://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk * It will be built as a separate artifact: libvcx ** Use separate build pipelines for libindy and libvcx, in order to avoid blocking both teams and provide fast turn-around for developer builds ** In the future we will evaluate this approach and consider combine into a single artifact * It will be installed as part of Indy SDK alongside libindy * Public API documentation exists * An interim plan for keeping the Hyperledger VCX and internal Evernym SDK development compatible until Evernym teams can switch to the public repository. * A plan is provided to the Evernym development teams on how they can begin using the indy-sdk repository.  ></description> </Issue>

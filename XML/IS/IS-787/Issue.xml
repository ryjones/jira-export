CDATA Today we found multiple cases when libindy prints secrets if trace log level is enabled. I suggest the following:  - Review the code and find all places - Introduce secret_debug! macro that will allow debug printing of secrets in test builds only. Log all secrets only with this macro if needed - ASAP wrap secrets to structs with modified Debug trait implemented similar to !secret_debug macro. It will allow safe logging of these structs.   This behavior should be implemented in both libindy and indy-crypto (consider to split it into 2 tasks)  ></description> </Issue>

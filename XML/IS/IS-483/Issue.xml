CDATA The special value being used as a parameter value in {{send}} commands for a field removal must be changed from the empty value to the value {{null}}. This will make the syntax of {{send}} commands more clear and error-safe.  For example, the command that removes {{verkey}} field from the nym {{V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f}} currently has the following form: {{send NYM dest=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f verkey=}}  The same command will have the following form after the change of the special value for a field removal: {{send NYM dest=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f verkey=null}}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Note that if instead, the process creates and stores the claim against the second claim request, the proof verifies (i.e., line 61, {noformat} ... = await anoncreds.issuer_create_claim(wallet_handle, claim_req_json 1 , claim_json, -1){noformat} instead of {{claim_req_json 0 }}  I can't say at present whether the magic correct claim request is arbitrary, time-based, or perhaps I need a wallet for every claim req?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The problem is that I had two separate claim requests in the same prover wallet. The correct binding is one claim request object per prover wallet; all claims from that prover (wallet) against a (schema, issuer_did) pair must refer to that claim request.  Kindly close the issue.  ></body> </Action>

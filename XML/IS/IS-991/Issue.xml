CDATA h3. * AxelNennker|https://github.com/AxelNennker * commented  on Jun 22|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/issues/897#issue-334774112  •  edited  |This line has a constant nonce  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/gettingStarted.js#L246  Two questions: # What are the requirements on nonce? Is there a minimum length or an exact length requirement? Some Rust code suggests that some nonces have an exact length.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/utils/crypto/chacha20poly1305_ietf/sodium.rs#L10  # In the Rust code there is a method gen_nonce. Would it make sense to expose that to the API and wrappers? If not, would you consider providing random nonce generation examples in all the getting_started guides to help developers generate them and not copying the static ones to production code.   {{var crypto = require('crypto'), biguint = require('biguint-format'); biguint.format(crypto.randomBytes(16), 'dec');}} There is zero information about what nonce is in  https://www.npmjs.com/package/indy-sdk .|  ></description> </Issue>

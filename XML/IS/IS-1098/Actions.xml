CDATA Thank you for the suggestion  ~smithbk .  We have previously discussed allowing credentials to be deleted from the wallet, but hadn't previously considered the GDPR implications of the requirement. We'll reevaluate how the requirement fits into the Evernym team backlog.  Alternatively, we would be happy to provide your team with guidance should you decide to work on the feature.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indy wallets are currently append-only, because deleting a credential accidentally could cause a user significant problems requiring the wallet to be recovered from a backup.  We recognize that at a minimum, it needs to be possible to mark a credential as being outdated.  If a user decides to leave an Indy ecosystem, deleting the wallet is sufficient for being compliant with GDPR. We are still evaluating what other compliance is necessary.  We will continue discussing how best to meet the underlying user requirement.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~smithbk  Also it would be nice if you can describe your use case in more details.  - Do you allow your cloud app to read user wallet unencrypted data?  - Do you store data of different users in one wallet?  Any information can help. For the moment it is possible to assign tags to credentials and you app can just add DELETED tag to credential and always use !DELETED filter.   To be GDPR compatible i see 2 ways now:  - delete the whole wallet - Don't allow cloud app to access any unencrypted data.   Anyway to use credential you need to have access to MasterSecret. Allowing cloud agent to use such data seems really orthogonal to SSI.  ></body> </Action>

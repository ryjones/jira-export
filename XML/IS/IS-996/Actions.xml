CDATA h3. * nage|https://github.com/nage * commented  on Feb 21|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/issues/539#issuecomment-367411139  |This has been a subject of a lot of discussion in the Identity WG and other places. Marta Piekarska is leading a collaborative effort to build out a paper on how Blockchains in general can address GDPR requirements here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnRYOZrGZS6h_-PnJRaq1pAc35GrfGUZcXh46sTHdFQ/edit#heading=h.xlkpssu5kfbq  Certainly we think that Indy's approach has many advantages when it comes to giving a user the ability to manage data sharing and meet GDPR requirements, but I am not aware of a paper that specifically addresses how Indy or an instance of Indy like Sovrin addresses GDPR requirements, but I could see how we could build out something very useful, and it would be a welcome contribution.|  ></body> </Action>

CDATA h3. * XeniaGabriela|https://github.com/XeniaGabriela * commented  on Mar 6|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/issues/539#issuecomment-370741605  |I wrote an article about the greatest challenge, Right to Erasure:  https://journal.tiiqu.com/open-questions-about-gdpr-compliance-in-the-context-of-blockchain-technologies-55f51860b048  While many properties of blockchain are great, this one is the most difficult to solve. It means that no personal data can be uploaded to the chain itself, only verifiers of personal data. The best way to link the verifier to the personal data would be ZKPs, simple hashes are considered pseudonymization, not anonymization, even though this opinion is questionable from a technical point of view (it is equivalent to say that good hashing can be backlinked or well encrypted data isn't private, the hacking procedures are the same...). So if you implement ZKPs as verifiers on the legder for personal offchain identity data, then you will be in a great position :-)|  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The approach suggested by Xenia Gabriela is exactly the approach we plan to take. We are updating our recommendations to clarify that personal data should not be on the ledger, just the definitions and public DIDs necessary to verify claims.  Because this issue doesn't require code changes to the Indy SDK, I'm going to close it.  However, I recognize that we need to improve our documentation and dissemination of best practices. That will be tracked separately.  ></body> </Action>

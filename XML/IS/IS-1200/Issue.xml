CDATA Build Info: indy-cli 1.8.1 indy-node 1.6.833  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup pool of 9 nodes. 2. Create client pool connection using genesis file with only 4 (1,2,3,4) nodes of 9. 3. Connect pool and demote the last 5 (5,6,7,8,9) of 9 nodes. 4. Exit CLI. 5. Start CLI and try to connect using existing pool created in Step2 (it was created from 4 pool txn genesis file and actual pool now has the same 4 nodes that were in genesis file).  Actual Results: `Pool has not been connected` error is appeared (see log ..9_minus_5).  Additional Info and Workaround: 1. The issue *is not reproduced* against 7 node pool with 3 nodes demoted (see log ..7_minus_3).   2. I was removing nodes to go from 16 down to my original 7 nodes. I was only operating on two at a time since I was also changing my instance type on the nodes that would be remaining. I had a CLI open and was verifying I could do writes all along the way. I killed my CLI session and started it again and then could not connect either. Everywhere we had libindy making a connection (VUI, Agencies, Automation) we had to delete the pool.btxn file and let it recreate off the same genesis file it used the first time.

CDATA Current approach with providing observers in Agent API looks too unnetural for async/await based environment.Â   Actually in related tests we have to just create Tasks that waits for callback call. It looks like unnecessary boilerplate.   I suggest the follwoing:  Provide additional Agent::WaitForEvent method that requres list of listeners or connnections handles and returns Task that waits for the first event on this handles.  This idea is already implemented in python wrapper. See  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/indy/agent.py  and corresponded tests for reference.  ></description> </Issue>

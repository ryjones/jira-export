CDATA I used test script _test_scenario_09.py and _test_scenario_11.py.  When the command to open the ledger is called (pool_handle = await pool.open_pool_ledger("testpool", None)) I get an error that says "Ledger merkle tree doesn\'t acceptable for current tree.".   Aside from the fact that the error doesn't make any sense, the process ends and the test fails.  I am unable to use libindy for anything.  I attached a screenshot of the output from pycharm.  I installed:  * libindy_1.0.0_amd64.deb version 1.00-194 from master (https://repo.evernym.com/libindy_crypto/ubuntu/master/) * libindy-crypto_0.1.2_amd64.dep from stable (https://repo.evernym.com/libindy_crypto/ubuntu/master/)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The reason the same generator is used is to correctly implement an aggregated BLS signature, the generators need to be the same otherwise signatures will not validate. The same is true for multi-signatures. Implementations normally use the base generator for the given curve. The current implementation is using BN254 and the base generator for that curve is Rbu3R4xPcZA3Kw4zAfQ4FX4TA92nXH3y8BaNNV9bY1bj5dz5Aws1Dw6ve8vapjT8zLzkeftpEGCeRuS5sX25So1FgUJxiwyM1wvhDdqUvfU9qBT7vDc7fhxekqTm7kiYRjMidEyxKrGHStEipBvWEvHjtN9YE5XE5onuPkvACj2jaw.  The code shows they multiply this base generator by a random field order element in order to calculate Indy's generator. So there isn't any specific structure going on here that I can see. They can document that they multiplied the base generator by a random scalar and that's it. I don't know the reasoning for this but I view it as a form of domain separation, meaning these BLS signatures are specific to the indy ledger and are not meant to be used anywhere else.

CDATA Thanks for asking the question  ~ignisvulpis . I wasn't previously aware of this requirement.  There isn't a good place in the documentation for this type of information, because it is really low level and not directly related to other parts of the architecture.  Maybe it should be a comment in the code?  ></body> </Action>

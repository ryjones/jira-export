CDATA {quote}{quote}{quote}This came from one of our Stewards:   From time to time, the following files get their access permissions modified to have world-writable file permissions which is not ideal from a system security perspective: /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sovtoken/metadata.json /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sovtokenfees/metadata.json   When it happened the first time I set the permissions to read/write for the file's owner and read for group/world. This action was performed around December 17.   Could you find out what process would be changing the permissions on these files and/or why it's necessary?{quote}{quote}{quote}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story* As a developer building applications for Indy networks, I want my wallet to be able to store DIDs from multiple networks: Sovrin Main, Sovrin Test, my development network, and my corporate network. This will make it easier to develop, test, and demo my applications.  *Notes* * Need to be able to work with multiple Indy networks: ** Sovrin Builder ** Sovrin Staging ** Sovrin Main ** Internal dev networks ** Findy * For each of these networks, we can identify associated DIDs and the connection information for the network. * We should be able to prove verifiable credentials anchored on each network for which we have ledger connection information. Ledger connection information needs to include the DID prefix and genesis information for each ledger. * A credential will be tied to a particular network: the schema definition and credential definition must be anchored on the same network. * We should add this support to Indy (instead of waiting for Aries) because people will continue using Indy in their identity solutions for some time after Aries matures. * Indy solutions should be able to deal with old style DIDs and Fully Qualified DIDs simultaneously. * If the application is asked to deal with a Fully Qualified DID  for which it does not have ledger connection information, it should raise an exception for the application layer to resolve.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Evaluate the current functionality of LibIndy, and the suggested application architecture for achieving this goal. * Create issues for remaining work.  ></description> </Issue>

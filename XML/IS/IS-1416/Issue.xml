CDATA The Aries community has decided that they want credential exchange to be handled within the language libraries, and not by a C-callable library like LibVCX. As such, LibVCX will not be moving to Aries, and maintenance will not keep pace with the evolution of the Aries protocols. We need to communicate this information to users of the Indy SDK.  *Acceptance Criteria* * User documentation is updated. * Release notes include a note. * API documentation is marked. * Jira issues related to LibVCX are closed. * An task exists in Jira to remove LibVCX from a future version.  ></description> </Issue>

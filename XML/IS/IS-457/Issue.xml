CDATA When trying to send a NYM transaction to the STN, the Indy SDK hangs.  This is a more complex ledger than others we have tested against, with nodes that have joined and left the pool over time.    A log file is attached.    It will probably be necessary for an engineer to debug this against the STN. The engineer should contact  ~mgbailey  to get credentials for a Trust Anchor on the network for debugging.  ></description> </Issue>

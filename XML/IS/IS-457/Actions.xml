CDATA Attached file   ^log_stn_nym_4_m   contains logs of my attempt to reproduce the issue. It illustrates different problem from client (indy-sdk) point of view but with high probability initial error and reproduced one has same "root" reason: problems with pool synchronization. As for current stable/rc of indy-sdk (1.1.0 or 1.1.1) same behavior of Nodes may results in sdk hangs. It fixed in master branch during IS-123 In the next release (or in the current master) this pool behavior should results in thrown error PoolLedgerTimeout. We expect new RC of indy-sdk in this week. It's possible to migrate timeouts changes from master to stable as hotfix. But I don't recommend this option because there is high risk to re-implement existing functionality for legacy code.  Also State Proof functionality can resolve this problem.   ~mgbailey  I think we can close this bug.   ~ashcherbakov  please re-view   ^log_stn_nym_4_m  log. It's not clear for me, how listed responses from some nodes are possible in theory.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA All packages were installed successfully. Client and ledger plugins works. The only issue is private repos so sshuttle via sshuttle-helper should be run to get GPG and packages (and sshuttle-helper is also private repo so now we should configure valid git account on node to clone sshuttle-helper repo then configure ssh valid account to run sshuttle and then we can import GPG and get packages using common way `apt install`) so I configure it on single machine, load deb packages and copy them to all nodes since this is a faster way.

CDATA *Story* As a developer building applications on top of LibIndy, I need to be able to rotate the keys for my Peer DID connections.  *Acceptance Criteria* * An API exists for rotating the public key of the other party in a pairwise connection.  *Notes* * Libindy provides the function to rotate my public and private key, but there is no way to rotate my copy of the public key for the other party in the pairwise connections ("their key"). We need to provide a way to rotate a pairwise key related to did. * LibVCX doesn't provide any key rotation * This story is for the API call, independent of the Aries Connection / Exchange protocol (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0023-did-exchange). That work will be in a future story.  ></description> </Issue>

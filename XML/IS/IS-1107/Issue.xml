CDATA Libindy and Libvcx use `lazy-static` crate in many places.   The most important usages are: * CommandExecutor in Libindy * ThreadPool in Libvcx  These structures spawn new threads for execution of commands. For both of these structures is implemented `Drop` trait but according to this  issue|https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/62  in lazy_static crate, `drop` function never will be called for them.   It is an important issue for both libraries because they can have hang threads.  It's a reason of  an issue|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1060  in Python wrappers.  We have tried to bind destruction of these structures on any `const/static` variable but unsuccessfully. The only solution for the current moment is adding of `shutdown` function in Libindy API.  Libvx already has this function, so we just need to add shutdowning of ThreadPool.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA For now if we send 2 transactions immediately:  1. NYM did 2. GET NYM did  The 2 can return "Not found". The reason is that we can accept state proof from node with outdated state. This behavior is expected RBFT feature, but we can implement efficient workaround:  - Result of NYM returns timestamp - We can remember this timestamp in opened pool context and filter all responses with outdated timestamp  To be reliable solution we need to implement https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1200 first  ></description> </Issue>

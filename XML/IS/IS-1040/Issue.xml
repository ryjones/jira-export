<Issue id="34585" key="IS-1040" number="1040" project="10401" reporter="ckochenower" creator="ckochenower" type="10006" summary="As a user of Indy CLI I would like help/hints for non-trivial workflows" description="Workflows using Indy CLI would be much easier if the CLI provided state/flow-based hints like {{git status}} does. For example, after running {{ledger mint-prepare ...}}, Indy CLI could provide hints to complete the next/remaining step/steps (i.e. ledger multi-sig and custom commands). I understand that Indy CLI isn’t as stateful as git and some flows may be more complex than git flow state transitions. Perhaps this feature isn’t feasible. However, guiding an Indy CLI user through non-trivial multi-step workflows/tasks seems to be ideal." priority="3" status="10405" created="2018-10-10 19:13:01.0" updated="2019-10-08 14:55:25.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="50711"/>

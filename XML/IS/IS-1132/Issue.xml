CDATA There are some intermittent tests currently in Indy CLI set. At least `rotate_resume_works_when_ledger_not_updated` fails time to time on Jenkins for master builds.  Suggested steps: * check available build history and determine set of intermittent tests * provide fixes and even hotfixes as short-term * create new separates tickets if some tests require significant refactoring  ></description> </Issue>

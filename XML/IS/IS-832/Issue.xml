CDATA We have some API calls that can be executed significant time. For example: * Wallet export/import * RevReg generation  We need have ability to get progress for these calls. I suggest the following: * Keep C API as is without additional cbs or params * Add indy_get_progress(cmd_handle) endpoint * For each wrapper analyze ability of progress reporting without API changes(extension of Future or Promise can be returned). If it is impossible for some wrappers than we can add similar "ext" method for each important endpoint that exposesÂ cmd_handle.  ></description> </Issue>

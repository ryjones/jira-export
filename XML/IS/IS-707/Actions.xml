CDATA After some searching, I found  this|https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-fail-a-build-with-warnings/2687 . Specifically, {code:none} #! cfg_attr(feature = "strict", deny(warnings))  {code}    The idea of using a rust feature to fail on warnings would be nice, because it would be opt in and enabled by {code:none} cargo build --features strict {code}    However, maybe we don't want to fail on all warnings by default... see  here|https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/anti_patterns/deny-warnings.md   ></body> </Action>

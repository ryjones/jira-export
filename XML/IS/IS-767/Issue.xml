CDATA Python-agent needs a place to list a users connections.  Each connection has a status, requested, request, established.  When a connection state is request, there should be a button that allows a user to accept that connection. Connections should have a button to reject a connection no matter what state it is in.  When a connection is displayed there should be a visual representation of its state, this could be a shading for requested and request connections with established not shaded.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We can reproduce it based on these steps below. # Prepare data for 2 methods   prover_get_claims and prover_get_claims_for_proof_req. # Call  prover_get_claims(wallet_handle, filter_json) method. # Call  prover_get_claims_for_proof_req(wallet_handle, proof_request_json) method.  Actual result: Libindy returned the error message: 'function' object has no attribute 'cb' (image1.png)  Expected result: It should be mentioned in the method comment or return the meaning full error/message.  *Note*: Relating to image2.png * the prover_get_claims.cb has created already (line 455-457) after we call “prover_get_claims”. So we cannot pass the condition (line 512) to create prover_get_claims_for_proof_req.cb line 514 . That means the “prover_get_claims_for_proof_req.cb” won’t be initialized. The error occurs at line 519: await do_call(…, …, prover_get_claims_for_proof_req.cb).  ></description> </Issue>

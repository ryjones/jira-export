CDATA Further investigation seems to indicate that implementing the finalizer (destructor in C#) may be pointless - not all .NET platforms invoke the finalizer before the process exits:   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44732234/why-does-the-finalize-destructor-example-not-work-in-net-core   Given that the use of the finalizer was to be a backstop to ensure the resources were released in the event that the developer failed to call Close() or Dispose() is this worth continuing to pursue?     ></body> </Action>

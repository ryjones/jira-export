CDATA Currently when opening the wallet there is an option "wallet open <wallet name> key=<my key>" which remains in the cli history log until closed. This option should be removed to prevent shoulder surfing attacks.  The "wallet open <wallet name> key" command prevents shoulder surfing attacks and should be the only option.  Additionally, when callingÂ "wallet open <wallet name> key" and then the key is entered incorrectly, the incorrect key is echoed back to the user. This should be replaced with a more generic message which doesn't echo back the previously key that was entered incorrectly.  We should also make sure this pattern isn't being used in other parts of the CLI.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~kdenhartog  I completely agreed with second part that echoing key is a wrong behavior, but i am thinking that we need to keep ability to provide key as part of command because it is deeply used in automation. I suggest the following:  1. Keep ability to provide secrets in command line only for BATCH mode and remove this ability in INTERACTIVE mode. 2. Avoid echoing of secrets in error messages  Also current behaviour corresponds to initial requirements and i suggest to consider this as a new future in Jira.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~kdenhartog   ~gudkov  I have some doubts about first part: current behavior is something like widely-used practice. If you check a large amount of bash utils the behavior will be exactly same - there are 2 options: - if you would like to security - you have to specify just parameter key for password - if you would like to history - you can plaintext password in command line and it will be stored.  and as Slava mentioned plaintext password is helpful feature for batch mod. And my opinion it's not so good idea to make different behavior in batch and interactive  ></body> </Action>

Out of personal preference, I&apos;d like to see INTERACTIVE mode set as default so a user gets the security by default and can enable BATCH mode. I&apos;m not sure hat the tradeoffs to this are though, so I&apos;ll defer to your expertise if this is the right way toappto app it." created="2018-07-26 14:25:04.0" updateauthor="kdenhartog" updated="2018-07-26 14:25:04.0"/>

CDATA Interactive or batch modes is not something can be switched. There are 2 ways to run CLI 1) interactive. Just run indy-cli executable and got Indy cli to input commands 2) batch. Pass path to script file at run of CLI - indy-cli will consume and run commands from the file and execute commands without user interaction.  For the second one plaintext password is must have for automation tasks. For the first one, CLI provide both capabilities (plaintext and hidden password). As it common way for CLI utils in general I suggest the following:  1) no changes in batch mode. 2) keep possibility of both variants for interactive, 3) but force users to secure-way: remove any mentions from documentation or help about plaintext password in interactive 4) remove echo of incorrect key   ~kdenhartog  are you OK with this plan?  ></body> </Action>

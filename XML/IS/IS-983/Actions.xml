CDATA Current Indy Getting Started Guide reflects only proving of existence user credential (Primary Proof). This  PR|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1043  doesn't cover `Revocation` scenario completely. We need to update  `Readme`, `Issuer` and `Prover` parts related to the issuance of a credential to explain `Revocation`. In the current state, changes in PR don't make any sense for GSG.  ></body> </Action>

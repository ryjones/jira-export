CDATA In the evolving  relationship management HIPE|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/31  and in the  DID peer method spec|https://github.com/dhh1128/peer-did-method-spec , one of the security features that's desirable is for Bob to tell Alice any time Alice changes her authorizations. This could help in a case where Alice has several agents (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, cloud, etc), and one of them is hacked; all other agents would find out if one of the agents attempted to update the DID Doc.  We need to implement this as we implement DID Doc support.  ></description> </Issue>

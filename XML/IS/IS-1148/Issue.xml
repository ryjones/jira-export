CDATA *Story* As a developer on an Indy network, I want the CLI to show me the author agreement before submitting my transactions to the ledger so that I can proactively review and accept the terms.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Before submitting a write to the public ledger, the CLI will display the current transaction agreement for that transaction type to the user. * The user will be asked to agree before the write can be signed and submitted. * The time and date when the user accepted is recorded as part of the transaction. * The mechanism by which the user agreed is user configurable with a default mapping to "Click Agreement".  *Notes* * The acceptance mechanism might be an enum / id value instead of a string. * It is the CLI user's responsibility to ensure that the indicated acceptance mechanism matches the string being used on the ledger that will receive the transaction.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA indy-cli 1.1.1~297 indy-node 1.2.251  ></environment> <description><! CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool with 4 nodes. 2. Stop indy-node services on any node (there are 3 active nodes, it is enough for consensus). 3. Try to connect to this pool using indy-cli.  *Actual Results:* indy-cli is crashed after timeout.  *Expected Results:* indy-cli should work independently on count of active nodes (because reading is possible when there is only one node in the pool).  *Additional information:* indy-cli works in case of demotion node on the same pool.  ></description> </Issue>

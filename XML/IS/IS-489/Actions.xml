CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.2.271 indy-cli 1.3.0~323 libindy 1.3.0~323  *Steps to Validate:*  1. Setup the pool with 4 nodes. 2. Stop indy-node services on any node (there are 3 active nodes, it is enough for consensus). 3. Try to connect to this pool using indy-cli.  *Actual Results:* indy-cli successfully connected to the pool and is able to write transactions.  *Additional Information:* Initial case was fixed, but indy-cli can't connect to pool with one active node. New ticket was created: INDY-525.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Lots more to come, but starting on some performance testing.  We ran a developer laptop (MacBook) based test last night and loaded about 27,000 credentials into an instance of TheOrgBook.  I don't think we pulled any data out of the wallet yet.  Everything, including the Indy Nodes (which after start up would have been doing nothing - only about 15 transactions run against them), were running locally.  At the 11 hour mark, something went off the rails, but no idea yet where that happened.  Nothing yet to report on pulling data out of the wallet.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We've continued to make progress and are running tests regularly. In the test running all components (Issuer, Holder, Verifier and Ledger) we loaded about 160k credentials in about 11 hours - about 238/min or ~4/sec.  While doing loading, we were running interactive proof requests that responded promptly.  We're pretty happy with those results. Next step is to put the apps on our OpenShift PaaS and see what performance we get.  I believe that was a single threaded test.  We have run a multi-threaded test that gave us about a 40% performance improvement.  The test includes our software (VON-Anchor - like libVCX, but in python) wrapping the Indy-SDK as the core of both agents.  The applications: * have a supply of JSON plaintext data for the credentials. * generate the credentials using Indy-SDK * send the credential to the Holder (TheOrgBook) * process the credential to extract claim data and load into TheOrgBooks search database * invoke Indy-SDK to store the credential in the default wallet.  The proof process is: * Hitting an API on TheOrgBook and passing in a credential ID * Constructing a proof request based on the credential type and ID * Completing a proof, including using Indy-SDK to get the credential from the wallet.  Proof performance is under a second.  So...all good so far.  ></body> </Action>

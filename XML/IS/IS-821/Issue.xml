CDATA A failure happens whenÂ libnullpay or libsovtoken are initialized. They both use env_logger which is already initialized by libindy. These are the messages from  ~gudkov :  In ideal design logger implementation must be configured by application only and libraries should use logger facede (log crate). Unfortunately now we don't have infrastructure for this. I believe it is problem that must be solved. I suggest to create ticket in IS JIRA.  As a quick-fix we can remove logger initialization in libnullpay (or use it for tests only). As next fix we can implement more tricky logger initialization in libindy, libnullpay and libsovtolen.  And reliable fix will be moving logger initialization to an application level.  ></description> </Issue>

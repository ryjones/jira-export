CDATA Seems it is related to the case when libindy and libnullpay linked statically.  Form log crate issue thread:  > The dynamic library will have its own copy of the logging backend (e.g. env_logger) which also needs to be initialized, but once that happens it should work just fine!  > If the plugin and main program both dynamically link the log crate, they should be able to share a logger as well.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Changes:  * Don't allow crash in logger::init in libindy, libnullpay and cli * Simplified logger init code * Use the same version of log and env_logger for libindy, libnullpay and cli * Called cargo update for cli and libnullpay * Fixed (enabled) logger in cli * Notified Nikita about necessity to apply this fix to libsovtoken  PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/975  ></body> </Action>

CDATA During the first install, while calling VCX_INIT with the pool key and wallet key that is stored in the phone, the following error attached in the screenshot is observed. After calling VCX_INIT thrice, then it gets succeeded. The same is not being observed with other devices.  Permission to write and read file is allowed by user. On Java side we are able to create a file before calling this API which inturn calls create pool config API. We verified by going in device file explorer and can see directory and files created by Java code. Also, wallet creation works fine which happens before pool config creation and we can see wallet directory being created in Android storage. However, it fails to create only pool config.  ></description> </Issue>

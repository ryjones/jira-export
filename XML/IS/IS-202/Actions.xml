<Action id="28158" issue="19114" author="peacekeeper" type="comment" body="I agree this seems like the right approach. I think this means that I would have to keep a static Map&lt;Integer, Agent.Connection&gt; and static Map&lt;Integer, Agent.Listener&gt;, so that I can call observers with the correct object. If people then forget to close the Connector/Listener, they would get a memory leak. But still this seems right." created="2017-07-11 14:49:34.0" updateauthor="peacekeeper" updated="2017-07-11 14:49:34.0"/>

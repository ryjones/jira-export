CDATA We currently use a global variable to handle protocol versioning, but this is not threadsafe. Specifically, it prevents tests from being run in parallel.  That API methods should be deprecated and the protocol version an option to all calls that build requests differently depending on protocol version.  (Or build two versions of libindy, one for version 1 and one for version 2 and remove support for version 1 later.)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When calling SDK functions in indy.dll under Windows from .NET and Java sometimes the called function fails to execute the command completion callback.  This appears to happen at random times and is not limited to a specific SDK function.  The behavior has been observed when running the Java wrapper unit test suite as well as when executing unit tests in .NET and from a .NET command line application.      ></description> </Issue>

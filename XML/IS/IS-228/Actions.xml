CDATA I'm still seeing the issue.  I've executed 10 test runs of the Java unit test suite and have never successfully completed the whole suite without getting stuck - some executions fail quickly, others pass many tests before failing.   I have, however, only seen failures when closing the pool this time around.  Below is the tail of the console output each time when the execution hangs: {code:java} INFO|command_executor |C:\Users\srott\Source\indy-sdk\src\commands\mod.rs:99 | PoolCommand command received INFO|pool_command_executor |C:\Users\srott\Source\indy-sdk\src\commands\pool.rs:81 | Close command received INFO|pooldefault_pool |C:\Users\srott\Source\indy-sdk\src\services\pool\mod.rs:487 | Drop started'{code} The log entries before these last three vary per-execution.  FYI - I am now using the latest indy-pool docker container as well.    ></body> </Action>

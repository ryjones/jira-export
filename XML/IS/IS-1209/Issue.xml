CDATA *Story* As a developer building an agent using the Indy SDK, I need an API to look up a DID by the public key so that I can connect an incoming message to a previous connection.  *Notes* * You need to be able to look up the key in order to decrypt the message, but the DID is not in the message envelope. * Workaround is to store extra meta-data: my verkey and their verkey in the pairwise connection. * This use case should be considered with DID Doc support, as one DID may have multiple keys.  ></description> </Issue>

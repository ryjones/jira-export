CDATA We need an Aries overview RFC to help pull all the parts together.  *Acceptance Criteria* * It should be a concept RFC: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts * Link to the other RFCs * UML diagram describing the flow and how it touches each part of the stack  *Notes* * Brevity is an important attribute of this document. It should be a compact overview. If the architecture does not allow a digestible overview, then we should re-examine the architecture. * We need to time-box this effort. * It should drive conversation and help people find consensus on the concepts. We can't be involved in many of those conversations, so if others don't find it valuable to finish the effort, we should rescind it.  ></description> </Issue>

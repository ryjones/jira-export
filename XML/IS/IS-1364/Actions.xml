<Action id="63746" issue="42068" author="drummondreed" type="comment" body=" ~esplinr  is right—a group of us are writing an RFC on the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack (new name for what is often called the SSI stack). However I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s the same thing as the Aries overview architecture RFC being proposed here. It&apos;s actually the &quot;next step back&quot; in terms of overview, i.e., it shows the entire Internet trust layer architecture that Hyperledger Indy/Ursa/Aries fit into. So it would probably pair very nicely with this RFC. I think the ToIP RFC authors would love to collaborate with the authors of this RFC." created="2019-09-13 02:19:09.0" updateauthor="drummondreed" updated="2019-09-13 02:19:09.0"/>

Rather it is a document that should be referenced by such a document because it will explain the overall Trust Over IP stack into which the Hyperledger Aries project fits. {quote}  ></body> </Action>

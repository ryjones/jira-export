CDATA As vcx is only part of agents system to play any example it requires access to some Cloud Agent. The only available is Evernym proprietary agency that canâ€™t be used by community.  We can implement simple (Dummy) Cloud Agent and put it into indy-sdk repo near vcx.  The scope of this ticket is about implementation of development infrastructure for this agent.   *Acceptance criteria:* * Build works * Tests run with one command * Full-stack Boilerplate is implemented * Can be easily launched as part of Indy SDK CI/CD pipelines    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Comment on associated PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1611 {quote} This PR has been stuck because the current Indy SDK maintainers aren't equipped to work in the  Objective C / Swift ecosystem.  During a recent Indy Contributors call, we discussed the future of the Indy SDK wrappers (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2019-09-23+Indy+Contributors+Call). We decided that these PRs should be closed, and we encourage you to create an Aries language library that meets your use case.  Thank you for your efforts to improve the Hyperledger Identity ecosystem. {quote}  ></body> </Action>

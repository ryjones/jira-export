CDATA  ~danielhardman   ~ashcherbakov   ~sergey.minaev   ~tylerq   ~rajesh.kalaria   ~nage   I am not sure that it is the right way to follow.  Wallet in libindy isn't general purpose database. It is intended to store only private primary crypto material now (DIDs, keys, ClaimDefs, Claims) that are related to Identity Owner only. Wallets are intended to save and secure the most critical data. Messages and Proofs are derivative application specific data that libindy helps to create and properly encrypt, but storage options seem application choice.  The problems we can meet with this approach are: 1. Security problems. We will concentrate on security of big database instead of security of small set of most critical data. 2. Performance and scale. Wallet has very simple interface. It doesn't provide indices or entities relationship.  3. We can force application developers to use libindy wallet instead of application level database to store all application data.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~SeanBohan_Sovrin  - another issue related to this that is a pain for developers.  Indy-SDK supports the use of Seeds for the creation of the keys associated with a DID, but does not for the keys associated with a Cred Def.  This means that a wallet with only DIDs can be recreated, but as soon as a Cred Def is created, the associated wallet cannot be recreated.  For development, especially on a shared ledger, this is a pain in the butt.  If seeds are to be supported, then make them useful in all places, not just some.  An alternative approach that may soon be available is the ability to backup/restore a wallet and that could be used by developers.  But it seems odd to support seeds in some places but not others.  ></body> </Action>

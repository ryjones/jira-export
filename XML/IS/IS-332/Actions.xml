CDATA I am not sure what the fix for this was.  The problem still exists and will cause libindy to hang.  When I step through the code, I make the call to ope the ledger(pool_handle = await pool.open_pool_ledger("pool_name", None) and I am taken to the base_events.py and events.py.  On line 139 of events.py, the status is set to None but the cycle is not broken and an exception is not thrown.  We should return an error that indicates the genesis file is not valid or was not found and error out gracefully.  As a note, when I run the same test from the CLI, I see this:   {code:java} The information required to connect this client to the nodes cannot be found. This is an error. To correct the error, get the file containing genesis transactions (the file name is `pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis`) from the github repository and place it in directory `/home/ubuntu/.sovrin`. The github url is https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-common/tree/stable/data. {code}   The libindy error whould be similar, to what we currently see in the CLI.  ></body> </Action>

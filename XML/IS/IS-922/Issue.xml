CDATA To be efficient on libvcx integration we need better understanding of vcx on SDK core team side. I suggest the following:  - Organize knowledge transfer if possible. May be Doug can provide this. - Review existing code, build infrastructure and available documentation review. - Identify API groups and covered use cases - Identify proprietary dependencies - Identify intersections with libindy - Identify any problems - Update vcx integration plan - Share knowledge inside of SDK team  Acceptance criteria:  - SDK core team should get better understanding of vcx and covered use cases - We need to have plan of VCX integration as set of well defined tickets in JIRA - We need to have rough estimation of each steps in this plan  ></description> </Issue>

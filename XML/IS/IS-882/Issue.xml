CDATA For better user friendliness CLI should use mixed start mode In this mode CLI read commands from certain file (like batch mode) but not closed in the end of file If file isn't specified - use file with default name from ~/.indy_cli folder (which empty from scratch - and there is no difference relative to current behaviour)  User can preset their own autorun commands like pool connection, wallet opening, DID choise, plugin loading  FYI  ~krw910   ~esplinr   ></description> </Issue>

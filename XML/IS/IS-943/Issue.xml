CDATA *Description*  VCX uses inefficient threads model starting new thread for each call and blocking on waiting results from libindy and tokio. It can cause performance and memory leaks issue for high-load agents.   Evernym has a version that is based on tokio-rs thread pool, but threadpool significantly helps only if you don't block on long libindy and http calls. Otherwise we will quickly get all threads blocked and poor concurrency as a result.  ></description> </Issue>

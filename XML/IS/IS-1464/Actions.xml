CDATA Hello,  ~debumonty   I'm not familiar with this portal. So I don't know it's the environment is used and what is going under the hood. For the case, you described: `AnoncredsProofRejected` error will be thrown by Libindy.  I updated Indy NodeJs anoncreds demo test to cover this case. It works as expected. (I use Ubuntu 16.04) It also passed on Ubuntu 18.04 during CI build. Here is PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2046   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Unmanaged resources connected to instances of the Agent.Connection, Agent.Listener, Pool and Wallet classes should be released when appropriate. Â Ideally these classes should implement the AutoCloseable interface so they can be closed (thereby releasing the unmanaged resources) from a try-with-resources block and should also ensure the resources are released in a finalizer.  Not sure how these function should be implemented as the the underlying SDK calls to close these resources are asynchronous and require a callback, which might not be desirable, especially during finalization.  ></description> </Issue>

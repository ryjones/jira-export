CDATA Thank you for reporting this issue. We definitely want to fix problems that result in crashes, but this problem report does not contain enough information.  We would appreciate: * A description of how you are using LibIndy, which API call were you accessing when you saw the crash. * Your Indy logs containing the full stack trace of the crash.  Following this advice will help your issue report to be useful to the team: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/How+to+Contribute#HowtoContribute-ReportinganIssue  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This issue doesn't relate directly to android. It fails on Libindy layer also. I updated Libindy logic to create revocation proof based on the presence of timestamps in a proof request. Here is PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1714  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I think creating the prool failed which led to an error which Java tried to retrieve using indy_get_current_error which crashed.  I think there was another issue regarding threads and getting the error but I can't find it just now.     Fixing proof generation does not fix the the underlying problem that error creation and error retrieval can occur on different threads which crashes.     Maybe the PR here  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1733/files  is a way to fix this too?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The Indy SDK wrappers are transitioning to become Aries language frameworks. Indy applications using .NET should use the Aries Framework for .NET:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet  As a result, we do not plan to fix these issues in the Indy wrapper. If these issues still apply to the Aries Framework .NET, they should be created there.  If anyone wants to volunteer to fix these issues in the Indy SDK Wrapper, they can reopen the issue and link to their pull request.  ></body> </Action>

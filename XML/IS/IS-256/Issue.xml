CDATA Unmanaged resources connected to instances of the Agent.Connection, Agent.Listener, Pool and Wallet classes should be released when appropriate.  Ideally these classes should implement the IDisposable interface so they can be closed (thereby releasing the unmanaged resources) from a using block and should also ensure the resources are released in a destructor.  Not sure how these functions should be implemented as the the underlying SDK calls to close these resources are asynchronous and require a callback, which might not be desirable, especially in the destructor.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Split the tests in two.  Those which can run in parallel and those which access global resources which need to run in one thread.  Change the CI scripts to run the first group in parallel and the second group as they are run now.  Â   (remove global resources: protocol version, logger, common wallet and pools in tests)  ></description> </Issue>

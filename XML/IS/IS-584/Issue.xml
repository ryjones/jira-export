CDATA These prebuilt dependencies are required to build Android binary of libindy.  With this, I also propose to use a new folder structure to better organise the prebuilt dependencies. This structure was finalised when  ~sergey.minaev  and I was discussing build mechanism and I think  ~sergey.minaev  also agrees with this.  The new folder structure is as follows   indy-sdk-prebuilt-deps ├── master │   ├── android │   │   ├── aarm64 │   │   ├── armv7 │   │   └── x86 │   ├── ios │   ├── linux │   ├── osx │   └── windows ├── rc └── stable  The existing prebuilt deps for windows should be moved in this folder.  Link for zipped folder with android deps. It does not have the windows deps.

CDATA Steps to reproduce:  1. Install indy-cli 1.13.0. 2. Stand up a ledger or get appropriate rights to setup TAA on an existing ledger. 3. Setup a TAA on a ledger. This includes configuring acceptance mechanisms.  Acceptance mechanisms can be given any arbitrary name and description, which means they MUST be discover-able so users of indy-cli can configure which to use in a config file.  The documentation found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/transaction-author-agreement.md The "TAA acceptance workflow" says: The list of available acceptance mechanisms can be received by sending get_acceptance_mechanisms request to ledger. However, there is no such get_acceptance_mechanisms request option under ledger help or pool help output. Trying ledger get_acceptance_mechanisms and pool get_acceptance_mechanisms both fail with "Unknown command ..."  !image-2019-12-04-17-25-47-124.png|thumbnail!   A nym can be written to the ledger if you create a file containing the following and start indy-cli with --config <file> as stated in the documentation. { "taaAcceptanceMechanism": "<a valid acceptance mechanism>" } Where "<a valid acceptance mechanism>" is one of the acceptance mechanisms configured when you setup the TAA on the ledger.  Anyone using the ledger could not discover what the list of valid acceptance mechanisms is by using indy-cli, because the advertised get_acceptance_mechanisms request option appears to not be supported by indy-cli.  ></description> </Issue>

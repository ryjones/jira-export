CDATA The basic idea here is that the crypto code belongs in Indy-crypto and not Indy-sdk; meaning, details of serialization and protocol belong in the sdk but anything that leverages pairings or encrypt/decrypt our signature checking should go into the lower level library.Â  This should allow the crypto to be audited and shared with other projects.  This story is about implementation of integration tests for new Anoncreds API in Indy Crypto.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We are currently proposing that SDK 2.0 includes default definitions of key Indy agent protocols. We should build a sample definition to better understand how these would look and communicate how they will relate to LibIndy.  The expected artifacts for this story is a: * Rust definitions of function signatures for the message family.  *Deliverable* We will spend 4 engineering days on this effort, and report back to the team for feedback on the usability of the solution. We will then decide if we should create further tickets.  *Notes* A protocol definition consists of: * The messages in the message family * Protocol transitions between messages But the protocol transitions are likely to be implemented within the implementation of the messages API.  * protocol does not define the transport layer.  The transport layer is determined by end points.  ></description> </Issue>

DIDs must be stored in the wallet and returned in fully qualified form. 2. Functions that accept DID as input must fullback to "did:sov" form if there is no prefix. We already have similar behavior for key types. 3. Tests should use did's in fully qualified form. Also we need to add tests about fullback. 4. Check that CLI is compatible with fully qualified DID's.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I recognize that a complete plan for Fully Qualified DIDs requires better understanding how we plan to manage DIDDocs and relationship state between agents. I want this ticket to provide guidance on how we much support we can add for Fully Qualified DIDs even without answering those bigger questions.  One possible sequence:  * Update input validation to allow fully qualified DIDs while assuming that they will always be the Sovrin Mainnet (":sov:") * Then make the network slug configurable * Then finally do the remaining work  ></body> </Action>

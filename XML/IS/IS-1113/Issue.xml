CDATA Copy/paste is much more deep than required. It makes code hard to understand and cause misleading. For example, storage don't need any cryptography and don't know anything about encoding, we don't need so deep error handling and etc...  Current code organization is also caused by copy/paste and can be simplified a lot  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~gudkov   ~sergey.minaev   thanks for all your feedback and for taking the time to review my code.  I've reviewed the postgres_storage code:  - Removed unnecessary error codes - Removed (duplicated) language.rs module  Other code is all required:  - utils.crypto.base64 = encoding and decoding of tags - utils.crypto.chacha20poly1305_ietf = required for const ENCRYPTED_KEY_LEN, used by EncryptedValue, used to decode wallet storage parameters  Code organization is based on whether code is specific to postgres storage or copied from libindy:  - postgres_storage module is specific to postgres - api, errors, utils and wallet_storage are all "cut & paste" copied from libindy  Please let me know if you have suggestions for how to re-organize the code.   My updates are in my repo (ianco/indy-sdk branch postgres_cleanup_1113) I haven't yet done a PR.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ianco  I will look to your branch ASAP. I don't understand why we need tags encoding? From storage point of view it isn't important to encode tags. All encoding should be performed by wallet and storage performs queries on plain values only. Could you explain? May be it is misunderstanding on my side.   Also i suggest to make PR with  WIP  tag that will allow us for more efficient collaboration.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indy SDK need to be able to verify state proofs to reduce Ledger load.  - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/364 - implementation in python.  - We need to have state trie code in indy-sdk for state proof verification - There is an ethereum implementation of etherium in rust called parity. It contains state trie and verification of state proofs.  ></description> </Issue>

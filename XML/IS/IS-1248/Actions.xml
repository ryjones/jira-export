CDATA Changes:  Implemented the same approach as for DID rotation.  -  `indy_issuer_rotate_credential_def_start` to generate temporary credential definitional keys for an existing cred def - `indy_sign_and_submit_request` - to send new cred def - `indy_issuer_rotate_credential_def_apply` - to apply temporary keys as the main for an existing Credential Definition in the wallet  Done in PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1785  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Won't "rotation" of the cred_def make it impossible to verify any of the credentials issued under the previous cred_def?Â   I think introducing this functionality may have disastrous consequences, and am curious as to what use case this change is attempting to address.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indy Node has allowed rotation of the keys for credential definitions for some time, and we noticed that Indy SDK did not have equivalent capability. We thought it would be valuable to keep the two parts of the system aligned.  The use case where this would be desirable is if the keys for a credential are compromised. The attacker could be issuing fraudulent credentials, and the proper response is to invalidate all existing credentials. If the credentials were not issued in a revocable manner, this would only be possible by rotating the keys. We agree that this likely to be a rare use case.  We agree that this command should not be implemented in the CLI, but should only be available to people who are explicitly calling it through the API. We will add a comment in the API documentation about it being a dangerous command.  We expect that production auth_rules will disallow rotating keys for credential definitions. cc  ~lbendixsen   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Okay, that makes sense.  Is there a ticket for adding a comment to the API documentation about how dangerous this is, or will that be done as part of this ticket?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Review these HIPEs:  Provide feedback on the HIPEs  Implement the changes possible in the current code base.  Pass the basic message tests of the agent test suite. Contribute missing tests to the agent test suite.  Provide feedback on the open questions that aren't resolved in the HIPE PR.  Raise relevant issues for further improvements.  Notes * LibVCX currently expects that all connections are started by the issuer agent, not by the mobile agent. This could make it difficult to pass both directions of the test. It may be necessary to raise a separate issue for implementing the connections initiated by the mobile agent.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There is no good general solution. We could stuff some or all parameters into structs but that does not really address readability.  There is a ton of boilerplate in getting from the api level through command-level and service-level to the method that actually does something. Maybe there could be macros that define the criticized function. Or we add `# allow(clippy::too_many_arguments) `  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are several points need to be solved: 1) there are a lot of places where top-level function overlaps actual error. 2) there are a lot of *creation errors which don't explain error cause at all. 3) there is a mapping of libindy error on Libvcx error of only small part, for others defined unknown_libndy error. 4) there common object_invalid_handle error and multiply useless *_invalid_handle error. an error message is enough to clarify what handle is invalid. 5) there are lots of useless error code defined.  Note: Solving these points will be *breaking change* for Apps validation that uses Libvcx.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Story*  As an organization issuing credentials on an Indy Node network, I need multiple trusted people to provide permission in order to make payments in order to secure my organization against theft through a single employee account.  *Acceptance Criteria* * A configuration exists where more than one user must approve transfers of tokens.  *Todo* * We need to do architecture and UX design of this issue ** Is it multiple keys in multiple wallets, or multiple holders necessary to access the token keys in a single wallet? * Issues for future work are created (should be an epic?) ** only require two users for transfers over a user defined threshold * Is this work for the wallet (part of Indy SDK) or is it work in the payment ledger (part of the teams implementing specific payment systems)  ></description> </Issue>

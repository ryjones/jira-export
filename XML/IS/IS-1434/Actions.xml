But in my local env - Ubuntu 18.04 and v1.12.0 tag - the result of android.build.sh for x86 doesn&apos;t contains TEXTREL in my env. I will continue investigation why my local build is different. Could you check in your env as well?" created="2019-12-11 14:30:53.0" updateauthor="sergey.minaev" updated="2019-12-11 14:31:18.0"/>

CDATA  ~sergey.minaev  I am not able to compile an android build locally. After running `android.build.sh -d x86` I get the following error at the end.  I haven't run this previously, so I'm not sure what could be causing it. Any thoughts?  !image-2019-12-11-15-02-56-994.png|width=1001,height=223!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Scenario:  In one process, I want to open a wallet named "foo" at /path/to/wallet/x/, and I at the same time I also want to open a wallet named "foo" at /path/to/wallet/y. These wallets have unique handles, and unique paths, so they should be open-able. However, today the SDK emits an error about "wallet already open", based purely on the fact that the wallet name is "foo" in both cases.  Expected behavior: as long as the combination of wallet name and path are unique, the SDK should allow such wallets to be opened.  ></description> </Issue>

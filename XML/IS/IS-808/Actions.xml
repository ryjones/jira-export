CDATA I'm attaching a sample from the libvcx Python wrapper. The VCX developers tell me the renaming is happening in libindy. Below is the output. The first set shows the proof content when the user has a credential. The second set shows the proof content when self attested attributes are provided.   Retrieving Proof   \{ "attr_info": \{ "name": "Major", "type": "revealed", "value": "Finance" }, "credential_uuid": "claim::56a23164-81a8-478e-9f74-fcf976a06fbb", "issuer_did": "QkzKmJJ82c4C9V7r1Pww87", "schema_seq_no": 1424 }, \{ "attr_info": \{ "name": "GPA", "type": "revealed", "value": "4.0" }, "credential_uuid": "claim::56a23164-81a8-478e-9f74-fcf976a06fbb", "issuer_did": "QkzKmJJ82c4C9V7r1Pww87", "schema_seq_no": 1424 }   Proof Received and verified!

CDATA  ~jjensenevernym  I reviewed 1.3.0 codebase and didn't find any appending _0 or _1 suffixes. And I have some doubts is renaming on libindy or vcx side... There is 2 options to continue investigation for this ticket. 1) ask vcx developers to provide minimal test which can show renaming on libindy side. 2) provide full isolated or public-access example. I can build vcx mentioned version and try to run it, but appropriate environment is required. In current sample you use some vcx config but it missed and may be use some private agency (?)    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Moreover I see some appending in vcx codebase https://github.com/evernym/sdk/blob/bc2e466a6f8caf6ba03a69dacb1b84835f9f71bf/vcx/libvcx/src/messages/proofs/proof_request.rs#L167 and https://github.com/evernym/sdk/blob/bc2e466a6f8caf6ba03a69dacb1b84835f9f71bf/vcx/libvcx/src/messages/proofs/proof_request.rs#L184 It seems like constructing of attr_referent. And somewhere it moved to name filed in attribute. It may be on vcx or libindy side. But libindy do nothing this self-attested.  And again 1.3.0 is very-very old and out-of-date version of libindy  ></body> </Action>

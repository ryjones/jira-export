CDATA The API documentation forÂ vcx_connection_send_message does not answer these questions: * What are the appropriate values for each of the parameters? * What are the valid options for msg_type?   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/libvcx/src/api/connection.rs#L506-L533   This is similarly a problem with the docstring for the Python wrapper:  https://gitlab.corp.evernym.com/dev/vcx/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/wrappers/python3/vcx/api/connection.py   Within the scope of this ticket, we will also look at other in-line API documentation to ensure that the appropriate input and output values are documented. We will limit that effort to 2 engineering days. If there are lots of additional problems, we will raise another ticket.  ></description> </Issue>

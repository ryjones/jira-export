CDATA Right now libVCX API accepts key-value JSON for attributes values. And the type of value in input is always a string. As soon as this string can be parsed to integer, libVCX applies integer-specific encoding. So { "attr1": "123", "attr2": "0456"} would be passed to internal math as 123 and 456.  As a result there is no way to have math proof to distinguish  0456 and 456 by using libVCX API.  As soon as real usecase will appears to distinguish such values we should re-design the API parameters.  ></description> </Issue>

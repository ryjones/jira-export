CDATA As Indy SDK user i should be able to retrieves the verkeys of the nodes in the validator pool.  RocketChat thread:  mgbailey16:57 I need a python script that 1) retrieves the verkeys of the nodes in the validator pool, and 2) posts a transaction in the config ledger to upgrade the software version on the pool. Is this possible with the sdk? Are there example scripts around that I can learn basics from?  @mgbailey {quote}> 1) retrieves the verkeys of the nodes in the validator pool {quote} As I know there is no dedicated GET_NODE operation support on indy node level. Nodes keys exchange is performed only when a client connects to nodes and creates merkle tree. Could you describe your use case for this? We can analyze this and consider to implement these operations in node and sdk. Ideally if you can create the ticket on our Jira with this feature request. {quote}> 2) posts a transaction in the config ledger to upgrade the software version on the pool. {quote} There is no builder helper for Upgrade transaction in indy sdk now, but it should be possible to create json message for this transaction manually and send it with indy_sign_and_submit_request call. We don't have an exact example of this transaction sending, but you can check how to send transactions to ledger with python here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/tests/demo/test_ledger.py  I will a create a ticket about support of Upgrade transaction message builder helper method in indy sdk.

CDATA The request from Daniel:  daniel.hardman  10:47 AM   Alex and Slava: i am feeling like we ought to harmonize the description of encryption mechanisms in https://github.com/evernym/protocol/blob/master/message-packaging.md#encrypted-messages with the functions in crypto.rs in the SDK. Part one of the need for sync is that the names of the functions crypto_box and crypto_box_seal are out of sync with the names “authcrypt” and “anoncrypt” (and “authdecrypt” / “anondecrypt”) in the protocol repo. I think “authcrypt” and “anoncrypt” are significantly better names; they do not make it clear that we’re using libsodium’s PKAE or sealed box mechanism, but they DO make it clear whether the encryption is authenticated or anonymous, which is more likely to help a programmer. So I vote to change the names of the functions in the sdk. If you have a strong argument the other way, please let me know. Otherwise, please make the change happen before MVP.  On the other hand, I believe the description of authcrypt in the protocol repo is slightly inaccurate. Could you raise PR that proposes an alternate paragraph to explain how it really works in the SDK?  ></description> </Issue>

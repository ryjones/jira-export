CDATA The order of schema fields returned by submitting a 'get claim def txn' do not reliably match the schema fields that result from a submitted 'claim def txn'.    Note that sometimes the fields are returned in the same order, sometimes not.   Please see the attached files for details which demonstrate the issue where the 'name' and 'male' fields are reversed.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Story*  As a developer building applications that are using wallet, I need to have functionality for export and import contents of the wallet so I can build backup/restore feature in my applications.   This functionality will allow application users to backup and move their wallet data to different agency or device.  *Acceptance criteria* * public API functions for export exist ** result of the export API functionality is encrypted file ** file is encrypted with encryption key ** exported file contains all wallet data ** export API function supports taking path and passphrase for deriving encryption key  * public API function for import exist ** import API function supports taking path to the file for import and passphrase for deriving decryption key ** import API function will throw an error if tried on a non-empty wallet ** import API function supports taking new master key for importing to a new wallet  * Export/import API functionality works on all storage implementations (default, plugged)  *Notes*  Design document: https://github.com/dkulic/indy-sdk/blob/1f7b0bddb5ac2958bff46847faa6946702f0cdfc/doc/design/009-wallet-export-import/README.md  Â   ></description> </Issue>

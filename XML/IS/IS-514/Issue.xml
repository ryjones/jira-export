CDATA As of now, we have a strange fix of using primary-key-tuples and seqNos. *    SCHEMA and CLAIM_DEF are identified by primary-key-tuples *    SCHEMA within CLAIM_DEF (`schemaRef` attribute in CLAIM_DEF) is identified by Schema's seqNo. *    The same problem is for REVOC_REG (we need to reference CLAIM_DEF there; should we use primary-key-tuple?)  We should unify reference approach and also fix internal storage of revocation register: indy_issuer_create_and_store_revoc_reg API call must create and store revocation registry using a unique referent and return this refer. Add refer as param to indy_issuer_create_claim and indy_issuer_revoke_claim function.     ></description> </Issue>

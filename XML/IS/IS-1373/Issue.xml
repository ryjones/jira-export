CDATA We urgently need to get off of our dependency on libgnustl for building the Android libindy.so artifact. This means changing the indy-sdk/libindy/android.build.sh script and the indy-sdk/libindy/android.test.sh and the indy-sdk/libnullpay/android.test.sh scripts. We may also need to change the libsovtoken build to not depend on libgnustl as well.  Our iOS Xcode 10.1 dependency is forced on us by this because we cannot upgrade react native to 0.59.x because react native 0.59.x no longer supports libgnustl. Due to these blocking issues it is becoming more and more urgent that we remove our Android libgnustl dependency and upgrade the NDK to android-ndk-r20-linux-x86_64.zip or android-ndk-r20-darwin-x86_64.zip rather than using the current NDK  android-ndk-r16b-darwin-x86_64.zip or android-ndk-r16b-linux-x86_64.zip.  ></description> </Issue>

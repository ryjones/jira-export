CDATA HIPEs status: basic HIPEs already merged to master branch of the hipes repo and it's enough to start some experimental implementation. But some of them are not mature enough. Test suites is not implemented as there is no well defined message families.  I suggest to perform next steps for migration VCX on new A2A protocol 1) merge PR related to Wire message HIPE (already available in master IndySDK) 2) In current codebase of IndySDK (mostly in VCX) implement supporting new HIPEs in the next order * Message type, cross-domain messaging, agent message structure, attachements - IS-1144 * Feature-discovery protocol - IS-1155 * Message threading IS-1153 * Test suite support - IS-1154  3)Â  Create HIPE about credential exchange message family IS-1125  Open questions: 1) DIDDoc support IS-605 and related 2) Backward compatibility problem. Current vision is reuse existing VCX API and switch behavior depending on initialization parameters. 3) Generic A2A most probably is part of libindy itself, not VCX. I suggest to consider option to merge libindy and libvcx into single library and distinguish layers by prefixes or namespaces  Risks: 1) there is some lack of details in HIPEs, other HIPEs don't merged yet or even not started 2) Evrnym model of forwarding agent may be not fully compatible with new one  ></body> </Action>

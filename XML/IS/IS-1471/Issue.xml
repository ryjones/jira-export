CDATA *Story* As a developer using LibVCX to create an application for peer-to-peer use cases, I should be able to initialize LibVCX without it needing a network connection to the ledger so that my firewall does not need to allow ZMQ traffic.  *Proposed Approach* * Create a new function "libvcx_init_minimal" that initializes the non-ledger objects * Create a new function "libvcx_init_ledger" that initializes the ledger object * Call those functions from libvcx_init * They would then be available for people to call separately  *Notes* * The function libvcx_init currently sets up everything needed for credential exchange use cases: wallet, ledger, etc. This was a design decision to simplify using LibVCX for the most common scenarios. * Experimentation will be needed to determine exactly which initialization steps could be postponed. * Removing ZMQ for client communications (IS-1326) would reduce the need for this effort.  ></description> </Issue>

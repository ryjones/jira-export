CDATA LibVCX is intended to simplify credential exchange solutions. Peer-to-peer use cases are normally addressed by calling LibIndy directly, or using one of the new Aries libraries.  This work won't be a priority until we understand who would be using LibVCX once the Aries libraries have matured. But we would be happy to accept a pull request if someone wants to make this change to meet their needs.  ></body> </Action>

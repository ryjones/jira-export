CDATA I sent a transaction from two sources that one address controlled.  Source 1 had 1000 tokens Source 2 had 500 tokens  I transferred successfully from Source 1 and Source 2 to another payment address 1250 tokens. I then immediately tried sending the same transaction. The sources non longer exist to pull from, but the logs show it is looking to the sequence number where those sources are listed on the ledger.  *The CLI returns the message* Transaction response has not been received  *The logs on the node show* will reject  {color:#DE350B}Issue{color} The correct message should let the user know that they do not have any tokens at that source. The current message makes it look like there is a network or node issue.  ></description> </Issue>

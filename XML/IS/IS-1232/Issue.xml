CDATA *Story* As a developer of an Indy identity application, I need to query the ledger in order to discover how many signatures of each role is required to execute my intended transaction so that I can guide the user appropriately.  *Notes* If application have information about auth rules and would like to send write request with update it may be non-trivial to understand requirements for this request as it may depends on current ledger state.

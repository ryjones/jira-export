CDATA *Story* As an administrator monitoring a deployment of the Indy Ledger, I want my application to be able to download all ledger transactions without unnecessarily loading the network or slowing down my application so that I can have multiple ledger browsers tailored to my specific search needs.  *Notes* * Currently a ledger browser uses GET_TXN for this, which is not optimized for this purpose. * GET_TXN is not a good way to download the ledger because it doesn't have state proofs / BLS multi-sig support yet (INDY-1954 in 1.9 release), so it's sent to all the Nodes and waits for f+1 equal replies (unlike other GET requests with state proof support). ï¿¼* Even if GET_TXN had state proofs/BLS multi-sig, it still would be not so efficient for download-all use case. * One option is to add an SDK command to use already existent catch-up protocol for DOMAIN ledger (it uses it for POOL ledger only as of now)  ></description> </Issue>

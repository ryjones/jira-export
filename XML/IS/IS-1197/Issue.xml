CDATA NodeJS isn't compatible with an approach implemented in libindy and vcx for getting error details because nodejs always invoke a callback in the node.js main thread event loop.  So, we can't read a variable that was set in another library thread.   We need to find about another way for getting error details for NodeJs wrappers.  Test that reproduces issue: https://github.com/Artemkaaas/indy-sdk/commit/c29406fd133c8a5e20c8e140f5116dfcf256de32  ></description> </Issue>

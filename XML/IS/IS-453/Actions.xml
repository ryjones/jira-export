CDATA  ~devin-fisher  AFAIK it's possible to retrieve Schema from the ledger only by schema_seq_no via GET_TXN transaction.  ~Artemkaaas   ~ashcherbakov  please correct me, if it's impossible in described workflow.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, as of now we return `schema_seq_no` as Schema's ID. And you can get it from the Ledger using `GET_TXN` request. The only problem with GET_TXN is that it doesn't support State Proofs, so libindy will need f+1 nodes to get result. I think this is not a blocker for Verity, but just a note for future.  If we want to use GET_SCHEMA (which support State Proofs), we need to do the following: 1) Use `(name, version, origin)` instead of `schema_seq_no` in libindy to identify a Schema. 2) Add a validation in indy-node to not allow any changes of existing Schema. So, if one needs to make changes in a Schema, he needs to create a new one with a new Version (or with a new name).  So, I think Verity is not blocked, and can use GET_TXN now. We can discuss whether we need to support GET_SCHEMA (I think it's worth doing to use the full power of state proofs).  ></body> </Action>

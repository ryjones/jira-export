CDATA  ~tmarkovski  we have researched the problem and found out that hexadecimal nonce is not supported by current Ursa. So I strongly recommend not to use hexadecimal nonces as long as Ursa do not support hexadecimal nonces correctly and generate nonces using function `indy_generate_nonce`. The reason why this test failed is change in (de)serialization of BigNum in OpenSSL between version 1.0.2h and 1.0.2i (the container you have provided has version 1.0.2g). So the proof was generated using the higher version and checked on a lower version and then failed because of different nonce deserialization. And we already have the issue for this problem and it is completed - IS-1309  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you for researching this  ~KitHat . I wouldn't have guessed that's the problem. I believe these was part of a codebase before `indy_generate_nonce` was added.  Cheers  ></body> </Action>

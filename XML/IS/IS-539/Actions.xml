CDATA  ~nhan.trong.nguyen   ~SeanBohan_Sovrin   ~ashcherbakov   libindy doesn't perform any complex values validation in sign_and_submit_request. It is responsibility of Indy Node.  Indy Node allows these characters and *we don't have any requirement or technical reasons that special characters must be prohibited here.*  So current behavior seems correct. If you want to introduce new requirement i suggest to create User Story with motivation in Indy project.   ~ashcherbakov  What do you think?  ></body> </Action>

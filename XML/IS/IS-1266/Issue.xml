CDATA # _Environment_:  ## Ubuntu 16.04 ## indy-cli built from tag v1.8.3  # _Steps to Reproduce_: open indy-cli, open wallet, and try to create a did of incorrect length. for example.  *did new did=LibindyDid1* # _Expected Behavior_: An error about the unexpected length of the provided did. ## for example: ### Error: Invalid structure Caused by: Trying to use did with unexpected len: *11*  # _Observed Behavior_: An error about the unexpected length of the base58 decoded did.  ## for example: ### Error: Invalid structure Caused by: Trying to use did with unexpected len: *8* # _Notes_: the offending code is here,  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/v1.8.3/libindy/src/services/crypto/mod.rs#L412 .

CDATA There was a discrepancy between libindy and indy-node signature preparation functions. hash, enc, raw are fields of ATTRIB and GET_ATTRIB requests. They require additional hashing during request signature preparation. There was a bug in Libindy that this hashing was applying for these fields even for no attrib related transactions. Fixed in PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1501  ></body> </Action>

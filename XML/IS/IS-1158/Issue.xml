CDATA bq. sklump 6:39 AM    bq. Hey indy-sdk fans! bq. I am feeling magnanimous, so I bestow a trade secret onto all before this comment scrolls off the end. bq. In a schema, do not call an attribute `hash`. It is reserved. The origin can write the schema to the ledger, but sending the cred def to the ledger returns a mysterious and otherwise un-troubleshoot-able bq. ``` bq. von_anchor.error.BadLedgerTxn: (1012) Ledger rejected transaction request: client request invalid: InsufficientCorrectSignatures(0, 1) bq. ``` bq. This lesson cost me 5 hours but is yours for the time it took to read this comment.   *We should either document which words are "keywords" or fix this it*.   I propose one of two possible solutions to fix it a) allow key words like hash so that nothing is broken or b) better logging so someone doesn't spend 5 hours trying to figure it out.   ></description> </Issue>

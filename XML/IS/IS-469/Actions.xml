Use scenario adopted to Indy SDK call. 2. The proposed scenario is available as sequence diagram in this PR  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/458 . Each arrow corresponds to libindy call in the most cases. 3. We added 2 new actors Sovrin Steward (to get Trust Anchors) and Government (to post claims schemes). 4. The following artifacts will be provided:  - Scenario will be implemented as complex well documented test for python wrapper. We will port the to to libindy and all wrappers later.  - There will be GSG as markdown document in doc/getting-started folder of Indy SDK repo. It will include code snippets from python test.  - GSG will be also available as Jupyter document for IPhyton kernel. It will be the same as markdown version, but code snippets will be available in code cells to allow code execution during GSG reading.  - There will be "getting-started" docker file with:    - Indy Pool    - libindy and python wrapper    - Jupyther with IPhyton kernel    It will allow to get environment for GSG execution in one simple command. 5. We plan to skip network communication details and transfer messages by just moving values through notebook code cells or python variables. Messages will be authcrypted or anoncrypted similar way to real agents.  ></body> </Action>

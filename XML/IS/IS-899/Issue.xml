CDATA Implement concurrency improvements Step 1 described in corresponded HIPE:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0012-concurrency-improvement   * Implement usage of thread pool for the most expensive crypto. * Make size of this pool configurable  The main idea here is provide very small libindy refactoring. Make thread pool for long crypto operations and refactor corresponded commands to be STMs similar to ledger_send command. As result long blocking command will be executed on this thread pool and normal commands can be executed in parallel.  Acceptance criteria:  * Proposed solution implemented in libindy with TDD approach * Automated test procedure provided * Changes documented * Migration guide updated * Release notes updated  ></description> </Issue>

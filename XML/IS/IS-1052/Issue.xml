CDATA Plugged storage API is documented, but there is no documentation to describe how to build a plugged storage (for example in Rust).  Should include how to link to libindy (for example, using rust wrapper?), what shared code is available, how to run test suite, as well as any lessons learned from previous storage implementations.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We agree that we don't have this level of documentation. The most applicable documents we currently have are these ones:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/003-wallet-storage  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/006-cli-plugins  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/design/011-wallet-query-language  The architecture of the payment plugins is very similar to the wallet plugins, so LibNullPay and the Sovrin LibSovToken plugins are good examples that can be used in creating a wallet plugin.  We think that building a wallet plugin is a rare use case, so creating a tutorial hasn't been a priority. But we would love your help in building a document like this.   ></body> </Action>

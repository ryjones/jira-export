CDATA Issues found: - CTRL+D is not handled as `exit` command - previous history is shuffled every time you open cli and just exit it without any other commands - commands like `ledger nym did=1111111111111111 verkey=FqsGX2jwM8MfwogA8p8jKPtA5PMB4DRmL2p22DXvmQBo` are not saveed in history  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-cli 1.10.0~1182  Actual Results: History persists between sessions as expected.  Additional Info: CLI doesn't save unsuccessful commands (during session and persistently) but it will be very useful to save them so IS-1321 was reported.  ></body> </Action>

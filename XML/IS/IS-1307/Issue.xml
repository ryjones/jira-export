CDATA *Acceptance Criteria* * Sensitive data such as seeds and private keys should not be written to disk, even in encrypted form.  *Notes* * We considered whether the history should be encrypted on the disk, and unlocked. We decided against it. ** That the CLI history is no more concerning than the Bash history. ** It would be odd to ask the user to retain a different password just for the history, and have to provide it before having to provide the password for opening a wallet.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Implement High test cases for Pool API: * *Create* * *Open* * *Refresh* * *Close* * *Delete*  High cases (alpha version): * Normal cases. Note that there can be multiple execution branches. We need to cover at each branch. Branches examples: ** Entity cached in the wallet ** Entity should be taken from the ledger* * Error cases that require an explicit recovering procedure. Examples: ** Invalid wallet credentials ** No entity found in the wallet ** No entity found in the ledger ** Transaction doesn't allow for current identity ** Unknown crypto ** Claim doesn't correspond to scheme, proof request doesn't correspond to claim and etc... ** Revocation registry is full and etc...  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Periodically (every 20-30 seconds) Jenkins server generates a lot of I/O activity that leads to high CPU usage and increases latency of http server response.  Results of investigation: * see a lot of tmp files with stack traces caused by Access denied exceptions which are not published in UI (pipelines console output) * these exceptions happens when Jenkins tries to cleanup workspaces but fails cause there are a set of files/dirs with root:root permissions * obviously it relates to docker routine  Suggestions: * review all docker routine that uses root (-u 0:0) inside containers and fix creation of files and dirs as root on host system  ></description> </Issue>

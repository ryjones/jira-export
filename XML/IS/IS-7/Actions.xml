The reason of the issue was conflict between libc++ and libstdc++ libraries. The solution is to use libc++ library for rust-zmq-pw crate. I have changed the build.rs file to use libstdc++ for linux build and to use libc++ for mac. After that I libsovrin builds without any problem on macos and linux. The changes commited into evernym/rust-zmq-pw, branch fix_macos_build.  ></body> </Action>

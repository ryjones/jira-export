CDATA Today, our wallet interface assumes that each wallet will be associated with exactly one pool. I think this is unnecessarily rigid. I want the same wallet to be able to store DIDs, keys, and other day from more than one pool. This will allow us to use our wallet to interoperate with other ledger types besides Indy, and will allow someone to conduct test transactions and real transactions without changing wallets. It is related to the backlog item (please confirm we have such an item in our backlog) to support fully qualified DIDs.  The association between a wallet and a pool should be implicit; we should store DID values fully qualified, and the prefixes on the DID value should tell us which pool the DID is associated with.  This change will also help us when we implement microledgers (which may have an association with a pool that is non-obvious).  ></description> </Issue>

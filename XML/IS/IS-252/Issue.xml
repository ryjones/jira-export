CDATA At the moment if you are running a very old version of Validator there is no way to know the errors we are seeing are caused due to this. Its possible in future the reverse might happen were Validator is of a higher version and SDK is not.  We might want to have some kind of check during {{indy_open_pool_ledger()}} which probably is the first command when SDK starts interacting with Sovrin Nodes. To check for some min/max version range, and report a error without trying further.  Example: 1.0.9 - 2.0.0  Conversely indy-node should always move to next higher Major version number if there is a compatibility breaking change. This way we can add logic in SDK to check for say version higher than 1.0.9 but less than 2.0.0             ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I performed review of HIPE and PR 1282. The following changes were requested:  1. Change how plugin is exposed. Instead of providing a lot of callback for indy_register_wallet_storage we need to provide one public postgress_storage_init function 2. Remove unnecessary register command from CLI in favor of existing load-plugin command 3. Remove libindy-common crate in favor of just copy paste.  I also suggested to do the following, but these items don't look like a blocker:  1. Remove in-memory plugin sample at all as it is incomplete and it is strange to have wallet without long-term persistence. 2. Remove mutexes as storage is always called from one thread Implement lazy loading of records 3. Look to my another comments  ></body> </Action>

CDATA PR was merged, but it requires some cleanup later:  - Copy/paste is much more deep than required. It makes code hard to understand and cause misleading. For example, storage don't need any cryptography and don't know anything about encoding, we don't need so deep error handling and etc... - Current code organization is also caused by copy/paste and can be simplified a lot - Correct lazy loading and avoiding of mutex-es are required  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ^cargo-trace-test-agent.log   My pleasure. Command  {{$ RUST_LOG=trace RUST_BACKTRACE=full RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 TEST_POOL_IP=10.0.0.2 cargo test --test agent 2>&1 | tee /tmp/cargo-trace-test-agent.log}}  produces the attached log file.  Docker version is {{Docker version 17.09.0-ce, build afdb6d4}}  I'm not sure what the nodes pool version is â€“ but {{ci/ubuntu.dockerfile}} has content:  ARG indy_plenum_ver=1.1.136 ARG indy_anoncreds_ver=1.0.25 ARG indy_node_ver=1.1.149 ARG python3_indy_crypto_ver=0.1.6 ARG indy_crypto_ver=0.1.6    If that doesn't help, please advise how to get the nodes pool version?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~sklump  Thank for full info! Minimal info is _indy_node_ver_ , but you provide all versions from docker file arguments, and as I understand, you don't change anyone from it. In full log there is actual reason of the all errors: {code:java} ERROR|indy::services::pool          |           src/services/pool/mod.rs:693 | Pool worker thread finished with error CommonError(InvalidState("Ledger merkle tree doesn\'t acceptable for current tree.")) {code} So, indy-sdk can connect to nodes, but can't verify it. Let's continue in RocketChat and after it will publish our investigation result.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA The solution is to docker-(re)build the indy-pool node from from \{\{ci/indy-pool.dockerfile}}.  Please close the ticket, thanks.  ></body> </Action>

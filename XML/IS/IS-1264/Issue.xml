CDATA Build Info: libindy 1.8.3~1097  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get current time timestamp. 2. Write REVOC REG DEF and REVOC REG ENTRY. 3. Get another current time timestamp. 4. Try to read REVOC REG DELTA with both timestamps as FROM and TO parameters.  Actual Results: Consensus is impossible error. If we use only Step 3 timestamp as TO parameter than we read state proof successfully.  Expected Results: We should make successfull state proof reading in both cases.  ></description> </Issue>

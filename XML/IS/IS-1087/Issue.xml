CDATA Proof generation should take less than 2 seconds from the SDK.  Proof generation in applications built by the Evernym engineering team is taking much longer. We are seeing the problem in both Android and IOS environments using Evernym's Connect.Me.  We should test that the delays are not in the time necessary for the SDK to respond.  Acceptance Criteria * Test proof generation in the following environment: ** A proof with 10 attributes ** Using 3 different credential definitions from 3 different trust anchors ** In Android environment (using the Android Wrapper) ** At the LibVCX layer * Report the distribution of response times.  *Notes* * We start with the Android layer because we have more reports of slowness from that layer. Investigating IOS would also be useful. * If the problem is identified in IS-1066, then this issue can be closed unless the team thinks further investigation would be instructive.  Reference issues (internal to Evernym): * CM-2070 - Connect.Me shouldn't be dependent on ledger connectivity for presenting proofs * CM-2072 - Sending a proof should take less than 2 seconds  ></description> </Issue>

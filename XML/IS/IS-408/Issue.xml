CDATA Using a version of libindy that does not support blskeys with a genesis transaction file that contains blskeys, will cause libindy to stop responding and wait endlessly for a response. Libindy should either timeout with an error or return a conneciton error.    I am using the Python wrapper, here is where the code hangs: {code:java} try: pool_handle = await pool.open_pool_ledger("pool_name", None) except IndyError as E: print("Error: " + str(E)) {code} I do not get an exception as an error is never returned. Instead, my console output shows the code is trying to open the ledger and just hangs.  Libindy should provide some output or information about what happened.  ></description> </Issue>

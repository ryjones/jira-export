CDATA *Story*  As a developer building a solution that uses Indy and Aries, I sometimes need to include an empty attribute in my proof because the data is present but empty. This allows me to model things like the second line of a U.S. address, which is often blank.  *Acceptance Criteria*  If a credential attribute contains no information, it should still be properly encoded so that it can be presented as part of a proof.  Guidance should be included in the documentation on how best to model credentials: * empty information (empty string) * information not present (NULL) * a placeholder such as "None" or "0 (Zero)" * optional information (see IS-1408)  *Examples* * Second line of an address * U.S. middle name / Russian patronymic  *Notes* * Once Rich Schemas are implemented (IS-1402), there will be a way  for the encoding to specify the null value.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently, the getting started guide does not do much by the way of explaining how to set up the test network, (nodes and agents for the nodes). This is probably a good thing, because setting up nodes is outside the scope of indy-sdk. The goal here is to create a dockerfile that generates the test network w/ agents properly, so that the user can dive right into the getting started guide.  Â   UPDATE: The maintainers on Github have directed me to dockerfiles in indy-node that already fills this role.  ></description> </Issue>

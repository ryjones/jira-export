CDATA For the current moment GSG is available as:  1. Libindy sample: indy-sdk\samples\python\src\getting_started.py 2. Jupyter script: C:\workspace\src\indy-sdk\doc\getting-started\getting-started.ipynb  - To run 1 you just need the pool from indy-sdk\ci\indy-pool.dockerfile - To run 2 we already have docker-compose script that starts all environment  I don't understand why we need something additional.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA So sorry for the late reply! I've been awfully sick this past week.  Good to know about that python script, I was not aware of that. However, it looks to me like the script goes beyond setting up the pool and goes through Alice's part too. The goal of this script was to create a docker pool that has Faber, Acme, and Thrift all set up by default, so that the user can jump right in as Alice.  I not completely sure of how this will be used, but  ~mdb  has plans for the getting started guide and would like to have this dockerfile for what he's trying to do. I don't know the exact details, so I'm just trying to get it into the repo so that he can use it for what he needs.  ></body> </Action>

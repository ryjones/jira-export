CDATA When a listener is closed the underlying SDK also closes all associated connections rendering their handles invalid.    The Java Agent.Listener receives a call to the agentListenConnectionCb() function it adds a an Agent.Connection instance to the static connections map, however when the listener is closed and those connections are invalidated the instances are never removed from the map.  ></description> </Issue>

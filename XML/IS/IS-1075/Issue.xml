CDATA *Acceptance Criteria* * Cache schema definitions and credential definitions so that a ledger read is not required in order to generate a proof. * The cached definitions should be refreshed monthly so that they are available when required. * The length of time for the cache to be refreshed should be configurable. * There should be an API call to force a cache refresh. * If a generated proof is found to be invalid, the cached definitions should be refreshed before the proof is re-generated.  *Notes* * If the cached definitions are out-of-date, the generated proof will fail. * Sending a proof should take less than 2 seconds.  ></description> </Issue>

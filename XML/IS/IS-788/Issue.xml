CDATA libvcx is testing getting transactions fees from the ledger using libnullpay.  To do this we first set some fees and then query to get them back.  This was working until we tried build 586 and the list of fees we get back is different from the list of fees we set.   Here is the output from the test: {noformat} setting fees: {"0":1, "1":1, "101":2, "102":42, "103":1999998889, "104":0, "105":0, "106":0, "107":0, "108":0, "109":0, "110":0, "111":0, "112":0, "113":0, "114":0, "115":0, "116":0, "117":0, "118":0, "119":0}  returned fees: {"116":0,"118":0,"110":0,"109":0,"111":0,"NYM":1,"104":0,"103":1999998889,"107":0,"106":0,"CRED_DEF":42,"119":0,"108":0,"114":0,"113":0,"112":0,"105":0,"117":0,"SCHEMA":2,"115":0,"0":1}{noformat} The fees we get back have the string representation.  Is this expected?  Looking at the libnullpay tests it seems the tests recently changed the static FEES string.  Is this expected?  Should libvcx use the strings (SCHEMA, CRED_DEF, NYM, for example) or should it use the numbers (1, 101, 102, for example)?  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="34645" issue="23960" author="slafranca" type="comment" body="Comments from the team running the tests:  libindy cannot remove any role. When we build NYM request to remove a role (use empty string for argument “role”), the returned request does not contain the “role” property. Thats why when libindy sends this request, the sovrin system cannot overwrite the role of Trustee (or Steward, TrustAnchor) and therefore the role of Trustee (or Steward, TrustAnchor) remains in the response of GET_NYM." created="2017-11-15 16:03:34.0" updateauthor="slafranca" updated="2017-11-15 16:03:34.0"/>

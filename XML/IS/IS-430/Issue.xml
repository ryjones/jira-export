CDATA While automating acceptance test 09, the test fails because the roles are not removed.  In the test document for test 09, new roles are created and used for various tests.  Once used, the new roles are removed and then tests are run to see if the user can use the removed roles to add NYMs or change roles.  After the code to remove the roles is complete, I can use the roles to perform functions like adding new roles or adding NYMs.  A test script has been added to this defect.  Some screen shots are also attached showing the output from the calls to remove roles and validation using Get_nym to see the results.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently log messages from the libindy library are written to stdout by default.Â  This can be modified by setting environment variables, but this should not be the default. If logging is not otherwise configured in an application that uses libindy, it should be sent to a default file or it should be silent.  Proper configuration of logging should be documented.  ></description> </Issue>

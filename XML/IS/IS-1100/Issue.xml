CDATA Hi.  I am following the demo given in the following link to understand how credential revocation works  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/tests/demo/test_anoncreds.py   I was able to succeed with a multi process demo with single prover but ran into a problem with multiple provers. I was able to reproduce the problem with the aforementioned demo.  When I add a new prover to the demo and issue a credential to this new prover, the original prover's verification fails IF new prover is issued a credential first. Otherwise, it still passes.   I attached passes and fails demos. Please have a look at it whether it is a bug with revocation or a bug with my logic or the demo that I am using is not comprehensive.   Thanks,  -Arda   ></description> </Issue>

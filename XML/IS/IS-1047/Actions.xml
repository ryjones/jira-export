CDATA I suggest creating a set of shared code that can be statically linked into libindy, cli, storage libraries etc.  For example it could look something like:  indy-sdk/shared  indy-sdk/shared/src  indy-sdk/shared/src/util  indy-sdk/shared/src/crypto  indy-sdk/shared/src/wallet  ... etc, and then we can move any shared code into this library.

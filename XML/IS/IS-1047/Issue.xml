CDATA Implement a shared library containing code required by plugged wallet storage.  Currently there is code within indy-sdk that is required by the plugged storage, but it is not available because it is in private modules.  Also it is not available through the API so is only available by statically linking libindy.  For example see code in the inmem and postgres storage plug-ins in PR:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1247   Duplicated files include:  src/utils/byte_array.rs, cstring.rs, sequence.rs, crypo functions, ctypes.rs, environment.rs, logger.rs  wallet functions - language.rs, query.rs, storage.rs (EncryptedValue, Tag, TagName, StorageRecord, etc), transaction.rs  Also src/postgres_wallet.rs (as implemented) is a fairly generic wrapper layer between the c-callable API and the underlying wallet storage functions, and can be made generic.     ></description> </Issue>

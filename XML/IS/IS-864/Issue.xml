CDATA Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set up the pool. 2. Start the traffic_shaping.sh on all the nodes. 3. Open indy-cli with RUST_LOG=indy=trace. 4. Connect to the pool with small timeouts. => indy-cli can't connect during timeout.  Actual Results: Following messages infinitely appear in rust logs: {code:java} TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")) TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")) TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")) TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")) TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")) TRACE|indy::services::pool::pool    |          src/services/pool/pool.rs:527 | received pool event: Some(Timeout("", "")){code} It's impossible to exit the cli normal way, ctrl+c results hanging of indy-cli. Only kill the process works.  Expected Results: Timeout error should appear only once.  Additional Information: The same case works without any problems without logging.  ></description> </Issue>

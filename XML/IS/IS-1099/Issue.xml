CDATA Suppose you have two credentials in your wallet that are from the same issuer.  The value of attribute 'foo' is the same.  The only difference between these two credentials with regard to attribute 'foo' is the issuance time.  Now suppose that you need to generate a proof with attribute 'foo' from one of these credentials and you want to prompt the user to ask which credential to use.  It would be helpful to have the issuance time in order to display to the user when choosing.  The following is a sample of a single entry that is returned by anoncreds.prover_get_credentials_for_proof_req  {code} {'cred_info': { 'cred_rev_id': None,  'cred_def_id': 'EswsMMSMaGVrwj65CX8ExX:3:CL:31:TAG1',  'schema_id': '6QGRQ7kcdR3Yu31YLQaP2i:2:Transcript:1.0',  'attrs': {'degree': 'Bachelor of Science, Marketing', 'average': '5', 'status': 'graduated', 'first_name': 'Alice', 'last_name': 'Garcia', 'ssn': '123-45-6789', 'year': '2015'},  'referent': '654d8436-0373-4c5c-8c48-f1c1b99e9188',  'rev_reg_id': None},  'interval': None }, {code}  Can a timestamp be added to each of these returned elements?  ></description> </Issue>

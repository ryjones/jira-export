CDATA There are 2 pre-checks in old indy client (python-based) for sending request to the ledger 1) catch-up at start 2) at sending moment: has enough connections (quorum can be reached) Force flag is disable the second one. And transaction could be sent to any small count of active nodes after catch-up. Indy-SDK perform only first check, and use zmq abstraction to not track active connections to the nodes. So there is no required changes to synchronize Indy-SDK behavior with python client from "force" flag point of view.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Getting started documentation could improve by:  - adding instructions on how to use the most recent stable releases for provided examples.  - removing assumptions, for example, the provided coding examples language is not clearly stated, the reader must make the assumption that the examples are python using the indy-sdk.  - having a "10 minutes to success" intro which is a copy paste script with comments.  - clearly referencing other useful code like theÂ indy-cli.  ></description> </Issue>

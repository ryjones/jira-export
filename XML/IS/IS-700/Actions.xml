<Action id="45334" issue="30199" author="gudkov" type="comment" body=" ~lodo1995  What if we just add INDY_HOME env variable that will be checked first in EnvironmentUtils::indy_home_path. It can solve Android problem without big expenses for introducing new API and all wrappers update. API for configuration is also good idea, but it will require more time to be aligned and implemented." created="2018-05-31 09:59:56.0" updateauthor="gudkov" updated="2018-05-31 09:59:56.0"/>
<Action id="45336" issue="30199" author="lodo1995" type="comment" body=" ~gudkov  It wouldn&apos;t really solve the Android issue, as official support for modifying environment variables has only been added with API level 21. Apparently there is a hidden API the works from level 18. For lower levels, as far as I know, one must resort to other unreliable hacks. Anyway, I now think that whatever solution is to be implemented, it should not be a configuration of libindy itself, but a configuration of the storage layer, which should handle all filesystem communication on behalf of libindy. In short, I now think that the second approach would be cleaner in terms of modularization and pluggability." created="2018-05-31 10:33:25.0" updateauthor="lodo1995" updated="2018-05-31 10:33:25.0"/>

CDATA  ~gudkov  While I agree with your idea of using the `INDY_HOME ` variable for storing the path, this would not work completely in the scenario in Android where we have multiple apps on same device using libindy and each app writes config to the same folder. This will be a leakage problem. I like the second proposal by  ~lodo1995  where file-system responsibility is delegated to another layer/module and also acknowledge that it will be a big change.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~faisal00813   ~lodo1995   This issue will be solved in libindy 1.6 as part of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-781  Default wallet storage will provide "path" parameter that points to root wallets directory. Also it corresponds the idea of "delegated to another layer/module" as wallet storage will be completely responsible on wallet data location.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Please see https://evernym.atlassian.net/browse/CO-1810 for details.   The time taken to restore a wallet in the Connect.me Android app is of the order of 40 seconds on most devices.  The time taken on the Connect.me iOS app is of the order of 8 seconds.  I would request  ~viswa0269   ~ryanmarsh  Khagesh to add more details relating to libindy version numbers, device info etc. I believe some of these details are already available in another ticket opened earlier.  ~viswa0269  Can you provide those details?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Use Case*: As a Verifier I want to allow a Proof Request to be satisfied from claims generated from a range of versions of the same schema.  Currently, a Proof Request specifies the exact version of a schema from which a claim can be used to satisfy the Request. This requirement will make it very difficult to evolve schemas and coordinate on versions - e.g. both held claims and the proof requests will have to be updated for schemas to be updated. In other fields, this kind of requirement has proven to be unworkable.  I propose that a Proof Request allow the specification a range of Schema Versions from which derived claims would be acceptable.  For example, a syntax much like what is used by something like a package manager - such as npm might work: *  NPM Package Dependencies|https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies  * As  ~srottem  points out - the use of  Semantic Versioning|https://semver.org/  makes sense here.  I don't know how this might affect the crypto underlying the anoncreds implementation, but from a business perspective, I think this would greatly improve the usability of the system.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We have the same issue with revocations against: 1.12.0 libindy + 1.10.0 indy-node 1.11.1 libindy + 1.9.2 indy-node 1.11.0 libindy + 1.9.1 indy-node but during 1.11.1 and 1.11.0 acceptance testing there were no issues so it looks like something in environment or underlying libraries goes wrong.  ></body> </Action>

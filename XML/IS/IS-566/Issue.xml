CDATA indy-node 1.3.51 (stable) libindy 1.3.1~371 indy-cli 1.3.1~371  QALive pool (7+18 nodes)  ></environment> <description><! CDATA Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup the pool of 7 nodes with 1.2.50 version. 2. Add 18 nodes with 1.2.50 version to the pool. 3. Write ~100 transactions to the pool. 4. Upgrade the pool to 1.3.51 version. 5. Run the load test several times using following command: for s in `seq 1 2000` ; do python3 Perf_Add_nyms.py -n 500 -s 25 ; done  Actual Results: About 25800 transactions were successfully written, after that load test freezes on connection to the pool. Indy-cli also can't connect to the pool. But old cli works without any issues.  Expected Result: Load test and indy-cli should connect to working pool.  Additional Information: Following action were performed after this problem: - Remove existing pool and wallet. - - It didn't help. Pool created, but connection don't work. - Upgrade libindy to latest master version. - - After this, load test worked only once. Second time it also freezes on connection to the pool.  Logs with RUST_LOG=indy=trace attached.  This problem blocks load testing on new RC.  ></description> </Issue>

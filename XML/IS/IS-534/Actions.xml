CDATA It looks really strange, because I installed and run it just now without any errors. May be all works because I had indy-cli installed before on my VM. I'll be able to try this on clear machine on Monday.  If you still have this VM, could you please try to run _RUST_LOG=indy=trace indy-cli_ and attach output to the ticket? It may be useful for developers, if I will not be able to reproduce your problem. Also, if it is possible it would be great to look at dependencies. Could you please run _dpkg -l | grep indy_ on your VM?  BTW, I'm sure that clear installation using apt works on the latest version (1.3.0~337) as it described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/cli#binaries  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The first command with the RUST_LOG setting produced no additional output including files in the working directory or in /var/log. The second command produced the following:  ii indy-cli 1.3.0~335 amd64 This is the official command line interface for Indy SDK, ii libindy 1.3.0 amd64 This is the official SDK for Hyperledger Indy, which provides a  I will try the build you referenced next week.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Seems incompatible libindy and cli versions are used. Could you provide exact versions of packages?  Most probable we need to update our vision how to handle dependencies or try to configure linker to don't skip symbols from binary of they present in linked dynamic libirary (not sure that it is possible).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~jjensenevernym , the reason of your problem is in different versions of libindy and indy-cli. As I can see, you use stable version of libindy, but it is incompatible with the latest master version of indy-cli.  To get indy-cli working, need to use the same version of libindy and indy-cli from the same branch. For example, to install  indy cli 1.3.0~335 you should perform following commands: {code:java} apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88 sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial master" sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y libindy=1.3.0~335 indy-cli=1.3.0~335{code} Note that installation of latest master version will work fine if you have added only _master_ repository. If you will have both of _master_ and _stable_, you will see initial problem because the latest _stable_ of libindy will be installed.  ></body> </Action>

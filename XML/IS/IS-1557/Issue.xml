CDATA Running against indy-sdk master branch   ></environment> <description><! CDATA Restrictions of the following format are not working for predicates in Indy proofs:  "restrictions":  { ..., "attr::name::value": "Alex" }   This is illustrated in the following 2 unit tests, which create 2 credentials and then requests proofs using the above restriction on the requested attributes and predicates:  1. With the attribute restriction on the attribute (works):  https://github.com/ianco/indy-sdk/blob/predicate_attr_restrictions/libindy/tests/anoncreds_demos.rs#L498  2. Additionally, with the same restriction on the predicate (fails):  https://github.com/ianco/indy-sdk/blob/predicate_attr_restrictions/libindy/tests/anoncreds_demos.rs#L607  The expectation is that these restrictions can be used on both requested attributes and predicates.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Libindy has 3 main layers of code organization and there are some concerns about code complexity of Command Executor Layer.  One of the factor is usage of manually written Commands (sometimes chain of multiply commands) for asynchronous logic like "get data from the ledger".  There is unstable async/await in nightly Rust, and it would be nice to re-implement the part of CE layer and compare the code complexity.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I am concerned about having static functions in a service layer as they contradict with the most of patterns for dependency injection and mocking. We don't use it too much for now, but can switch later.  Also we will start usage of different types of DIDs in the near future. As a result we will need access to service state to get correct handler and will need to return back to instance method approach.  I suggest the following:  1. We can keep the code as is. 2. We can move validate method to /utils/did.rs and use it.  Personally i am in favor of approach (1) as the current PR doesn't solve real problems, but can introduce complexity in the future refactorings.   ~ignisvulpis  I am closing this for now. if you still think that approach (2) is significantly better then re-open, but it is better to have it as a new PR.   ></body> </Action>

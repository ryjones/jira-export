CDATA I believe that today, code in our internal wallet layer branches as follows:  if (default storage) {      do x  } else {     call the storage plugin that's active  }  This creates a situation where the default storage is never exercised as a storage plugin. We don't notice problems with the storage plugin infrastructure because most of our testing uses the default storage and thus takes an alternate path through the code.  I want the default storage to be loaded like any other plugin, so there is only a single path through the code. I suspect this will be slightly less efficient at runtime, but I don't think that is an important consideration; the value of a single code path and of the default storage telling us whether the storage plugin interface works seems far higher.  ></description> </Issue>

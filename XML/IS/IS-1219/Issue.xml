CDATA tear_down does too much. It deletes ALL wallets. In fact it deletes everything in INDY_HOME and all inmem_wallets.  Â   If a test closed and deleted the wallet(s) and pools it created then remove tear_down from that test.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/tests/utils/mod.rs#L54  ></description> </Issue>

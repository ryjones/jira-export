CDATA After IS-897 fixes we got the following feedback:  rajesh.kalaria  3:24 PM  @vyacheslav.gudkov, I was integrating the changes and yes, now I don't see any libindy api call taking time, mostly all under 200-400 mills I guess Now I am doing some refactoring in my code whereever it is taking time to make those agency api response time faster so as of now, I don't see any issue in libindy calls, thanks guys   ></body> </Action>

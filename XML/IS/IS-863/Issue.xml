CDATA *Story*  As a developer working with an Indy Network,  I should not be required to specify a DID in order to submit a GET transaction to the ledger. The additional stop increases developer frustration with using the network.     *Acceptance Criteria* * The SDK should always set a fake DID as the "identifier" ** This fake identifier should be easily identifiable as fake, such as all zeros * A ticket should be raised in the Indy Node project for the ledger to not require a DID for GET transactions.  ></description> </Issue>

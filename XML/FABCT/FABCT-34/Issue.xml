CDATA This desire is mostly based around logging. I want (some) log messages from the chaincode to state the chaincode-operation they are a part of. Currently, I can only log stub.GetStringArgs() 0 , which looks something like "com.myorg.chaincode.myapp/txn/1". I would rather log that the message is coming from a "MyBusinessProcess" transaction.  As I understand it chaintool is responsible is mapping function identifiers to function names, so it would be nice if it provided a way for the application to apply that mapping to the introspection data it has access to.  ></description> </Issue>

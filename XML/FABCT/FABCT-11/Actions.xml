CDATA I thought I had commented on this one - my bad.  I do not believe that this is a high security bug:  1) Installation of chaincode is an administrative action.  Before installing any chaincode, users/admins should actually inspect the contents of the chaincode package.  2) There is a signed chaincode package which should be used for production systems.  This should be used to enforce the inspection workflow.  3) Nothing bad actually happens here.  The result of all of this is that the chaincode will not launch.  And even if people install a bad package, they simply need later install an updated package and upgrade the chaincode to get it running  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="39328" issue="24525" author="dhuseby" type="comment" body="I&apos;m OK with downgrading this bug per your comment.  My only concern is that with #1 you&apos;re basically saying that all operators will have to have the capability of inspecting the chaincode source code and making sense of it.  I could think of a consortium situation where one member recommends installing an updated chaincode and all of the other members just blindly install it.  I guess we can&apos;t fix user error.  Maybe we need to make sure the end user is aware of the danger of running un-reviewed chaincode." created="2018-01-29 21:57:10.0" updateauthor="dhuseby" updated="2018-01-29 21:57:10.0"/>

It sounds to me like an unvalidated path bug.  Are you saying that the path will have to point to a signed chaincode bundle for anything to actually be installed/run?" created="2018-01-29 21:59:12.0" updateauthor="dhuseby" updated="2018-01-29 21:59:12.0"/>

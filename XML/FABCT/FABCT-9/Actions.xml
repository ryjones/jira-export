CDATA I can't tell yet/right-away if the severity of this is HIGH or MEDIUM. Will appreciate it if others (e.g.,  ~mastersingh24  and  ~jyellick  ) could chime in. That is, given the latest merges to v1.0.0-rc1, how difficult is it to get these examples to work (again?), etc.  Thank you.  ></body> </Action>

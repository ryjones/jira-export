Filesystem errors generated by attempted operations on synced directories are presumed to be OS-specific, hence the generic 'Protocol error'. Only one test case falls into this category -- the server's attempt to write a file with a name that is too long (which is in fact, OS-specific).   The solution is to change the config file name in the test to be absolute, and to select a directory which is internal to the vagrant machine, not shared with the host OS.  ></body> </Action>

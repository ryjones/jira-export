CDATA The problem that this feature is meant to solve is to prevent things from stopping to work when certificates expire.  People can easily forget to renew certificates until it is too late and then they are left scrambling to get new certificates, and until this is done, the infrastructure is down.  fabric should support notification (and optionally auto-renewal of certificates). Currently fabric checks expiration of TLS certs but not ecerts.  In the future, it will check ecert expiration also.  Fabric CA checks certificate expiration already.  fabric CA already supports certificate renewal via the "fabric-ca-client reenroll" command.  What is missing is: 1) Something in the peer, orderer, and chaincode which checks for certificate expiration and executes some customizable actions prior to expiration. 2) If using fabric CA or some other CA which supports automatic renewal, automatic renewal should be possible.  ></description> </Issue>

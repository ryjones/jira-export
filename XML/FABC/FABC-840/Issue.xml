CDATA While there is currently a fabric-ca-client binary, the client code is not structured to be a library package.  This makes it very difficult to build tools or applications which need to communicate with Fabric CA.  Looked at the fabric-sdk-go as well but it basically copies a bunch of the fabric-ca code under internal packages.  It would actually be a good candidate for consuming this client library.  ></description> </Issue>

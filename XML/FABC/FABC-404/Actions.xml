CDATA There would still be problems with other attributes such as hf.Revoker. To fix this, the "hf.Registrar.Attributes" will be an additional check made, but the registrar will still be required to own an "hf.*" attribute before registering another identity with that attribute. More specifically, the following checks will be made during registration of an attribute: 1) For ALL attributes, the name of the attribute being registered must match the value of registrar's hf.Registrar.Attributes attribute 2) For hf.* attributes, the registrar must own the attribute and if the attribute is a boolean attribute (such as "hf.Revoker"), the registrar's value for the attribute must be true. The other special cases for checking the value of "hf.Registrar.Roles" and "hf.Registrar.DelegateRoles" will continue to be made. The special case for checking the value of "hf.Registrar.Attributes" is that the registree's value must be equal to or a subset of the registrar's value.  This is why we only support the trailing "*" for pattern matching here, to make it easy to perform the subset operation.  ></body> </Action>

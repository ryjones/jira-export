CDATA Review/improve the COP README.md.   Some thoughts include: 1) Create a table of contents at the top 2) Create a section with a table describing all fields in the server's config.json and section with a table describing the fields in csr.json. 3) Section for environment variables 4) Perhaps a "How to section" 5) Anything else you can think of to make it as readable and easy to understand as possible  ></description> </Issue>

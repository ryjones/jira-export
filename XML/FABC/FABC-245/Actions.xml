CDATA The code is overly restrictive which is why this is happening. It should make sure that the <subjectDN, issuerDN> is unique for all CAs in a server, but it is currently looking at only the subject's CN. In your case, the CN of the issuer would be different because you are going to different CAs in the parent server, so this error would not occur. That said, in order to work around this, you simply need to use different enrollment IDs in each root CA and then use that name in each intermediate CA to enroll. I suggest using the name of the CA as part of the enrollment ID.  Since there is a work around for this and we don't want to rush this fix, we will wait until early next week before pushing the fix so we don't risk any instability.  ></body> </Action>

<Issue id="20506" key="FABC-647" number="647" project="10607" reporter="mdr" creator="mdr" type="10002" summary="Documenting semantics of idemix msp" description="Currently, when calling validating an identity using the idemix msp, it does not verify any cryptographic material. This is because a signature also &apos;contains&apos; the certificate, whereas with x509 the certificate is individually verified in validate(). When first calling validate and later verifying signatures with an identity, both the msp-impl and idemixmsp give the guarantee that the messages were signed by members that were issued a credential. However, if you only call validate without later verifying a signature, the behavior might be different. While we&apos;re not aware of any code that does that and cannot think of a use case of this, we should still document this difference." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="6" created="2017-08-29 13:02:01.0" updated="2019-07-27 14:42:36.0" resolutiondate="2019-07-27 14:40:57.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="34613"/>

CDATA After FAB-9938 (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/21743/), the Go SDK 1.1 client breaks when communicating to the latest CA server. This issue is due to the token modification in the merged CR.  The failure can be seen in: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/21905/ (an unrelated change, but x86 CI includes tests of the SDK against latest.   ~sudeshrshetty  looked into an SDK fix but has the issue that he now needs to know whether to produce a 1.2 token or a pre 1.2 token. ie need to switch the code based on the ca version.   This issue seems to be a backwards incompatibility.   ></description> </Issue>

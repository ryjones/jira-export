CDATA If fabric-ca server is not configured as TLS Server and Client connects to it as TLS client , it'll try to connect to non-TLS server , client does not see that port listening on TLS and initiate non-TLS traffic , that seems desired behavior. TLS is forced by Server , not client. Again it is dependent on TLS implementation of libraries. GoLang TLS implementation behaving the way it is.TLS is  It does not seem to be valid use case. To me valid use case will be trying to connect to Fabric CA on SSL protocol , if that succeed , then Fabric CA server is susceptible poodle or hearltbleed attack. It won't succeed as fabric CA server is configured to use Strong Cipher Suite. Closing this issue.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ashutosh_kumar   ~ChristopherFerris  If the fabric-ca is not configured as a TLS server and the client tries to connect as a TLS client, is there any signal to the SDK client that the connection is insecure so that the connection can be dropped before the SDK transmits the secrets over the wire?  Seems like the client should have control over whether their secrets are transmitted over an insecure channel or not.  This also goes back to fact that authentication is done by transmitting a secret value.  If authentication was done with a challenge-response protocol this wouldn't be such an issue, but it isn't.  I'm re-opening this bug because one of two things should be done: 1) change the authentication to a challenge-response instead of transmitting a secret key, or 2) make the client fail to connect when the SDK client code asks to connect with TLS and the fabric-ca isn't configured to use TLS.  The last thing we want is to have the secret key automatically transmitted on an automatically downgraded, insecure channel.  A MitM attack to get client secrets is trivial as is.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~dhuseby  , If Fabric CA server is not configured for TLS and non-TLS client tries to connect , the connection does not happen. No TLS handshake happens , hence no secret is transmitted over wire. No downgrade is in play here.  I do not see this is an issue. This bug needs to be closed.        ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~denyeart  , Thanks for bringing that up. It was oversight on my part.  When Fabric CA server is not being configured as TLS Server as TLS client tries to connect , connection will not happen and error will be thrown.  TLS handshake initiates at the Server , not at the client and if fabric ca server is not being configured as TLS Server , no TLS handshake will take place and hence no secret will be generated.     ></body> </Action>

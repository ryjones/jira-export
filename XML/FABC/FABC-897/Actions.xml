CDATA It seems that when we gen the CSR we use the request name (ie the user passed in the URL) as opposed to the client config's csr.cnÂ  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/lib/client.go#L268   Seems like this must match the enrollment ID ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/lib/serverenroll.go#L186-L187 ) when the server handles the request which is always set to the username ( https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/lib/serverrequestcontext.go#L132 ). If I change the above line in the client to pass the client config's CN, the server ends up failing because the CN of the request no longer matches the username. Not sure what the expected behavior should be here around the CN.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The usage is incorrect, during enrollment the 'cn' comes from your enrollment id. In this case, specifying a name using '--id.name tongli' but then using ` https://admin:adminpw@ca1.org1.example.com:7054|https://admin:adminpw@ca1.org1.example.com:7054/ ` the credentials of admin to enroll will not result in cn being set to `tongli`.  If one wants to have a cn of `tongli`, that identity needs to be registered first with the name `tongli` and then enrolling it with something like ` https://tongli:|https://tongli/ <password>@ca1.org1.example.com:7054` will result in the cn getting set to tongli.  This looks to be working as designed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Try this: bootstrap the server without TLS. The only folder under "msp" is "keystore" (and it contains a private key, as expected).  Now try this: bootstrap the server with TLS enabled. "cacerts" and "signcerts" folders have been generated under "msp". There is no need for this; the folders are empty.  This is an unjustified asymmetry between the two modes of operation.  Bootstrapping the server with TLS enabled should not create "cacerts" and "signcerts" folders under "msp".  ></description> </Issue>

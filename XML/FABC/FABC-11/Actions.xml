CDATA Hello  ~sang , This can be solved quite easily - in the fabric-ca/images/fabric-ca-orderer there is a Dockerfile.in.   Change the line:  FROM _NEXUS_REPO_/fabric-orderer:_STABLE_TAG_ to point to the fabric-orderer you have priosly built and exists locally on your machine, such as:  FROM hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest   From that point the fabric-ca-orderer should build. I have successfully built it on my RP and am marking this as solved.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We should provide a mechanism to encrypt sensitive information that is correctly stored within the various configuration files.  This would definitely include passwords (and perhaps even usernames).  There are a couple of ways to do this:  1) Initial config is in clear text but encrypt on first use  2) Provide an encryption format for people to use to encrypt config items (i.e. use some type of tagging around text entries to indicate that they are encrypted)     Of course we need a way to actually encrypt/decrypt without leaking the encryption key  ></description> </Issue>

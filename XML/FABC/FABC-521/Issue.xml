CDATA This is peripherally related to  fabric-ca need more accurate http status codes https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7466 but it is really a separate issue.  FAB-7466 deal with classification of error messages, while the current issue targets the insecure content of the error messages. the code should be inspected for cases in which the server returns detailed descriptions of auth/access errors. These details should be limited to the server's log and not externalized to the client. The client should receive no more, no less than 401 - Unauthorized 403 - Forbidden  Whether this holds true for 404 - Not Found is debatable.  On the other hand, for 400 - Bad request erors, detailed descriptions in the server's response to the client is fine, and in fact preferred. (As an aside, there are several places in the code where 400 is returned erroneously, but FAB-7466 should take care of that.)  ></description> </Issue>

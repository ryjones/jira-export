CDATA Fabric v0.5 has a lot of issues that stem from the fact that Fabric currently does not have a concept of an 'Account'.    JonathanLevi  I am going to add a lot more detail about this, but just quickly, we really need to address the current flow from the first step of the very initial "on boarding" of an account (say, "identity") on to Fabric.  The context of this Epic is the fact that we currently have a lot of issues with the existing "temporary" design that needs fixing. For example, the separation of the OTP/user-name password pairs as the 'default' credentials for initially accessing MS, the (limited) ability to "un-register" a user - which is currently done only on the "client" side... and does not affect "Fabric", as it currently not reflected in a "system-wide" fashion.      ></description> </Issue>

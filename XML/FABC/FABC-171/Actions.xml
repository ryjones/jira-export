<Action id="21790" issue="15339" author="mastersingh24" type="comment" body=" ~jjjjibm  - the issue is that one of the files used by the vendored cfssl packages uses illegal Windows characters.  There&apos;s not much that can be done about that but if should not actually cause you any issues.  If built the fabric-ca directly on Windows before as well as submitted changes.  So I&apos;m going to close this because there&apos;s really nothing that can be done about it and I don&apos;t believe this actually affects anything" created="2017-04-02 12:15:45.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2017-04-02 12:15:45.0"/>

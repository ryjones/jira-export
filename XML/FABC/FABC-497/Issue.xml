CDATA Right now all client side flags are registered as global. In this case, flags that are not relevant to the specific client command you are trying to run are displayed as well. Since some flags don't have any impact on all client side commands, it should be improved so that only relevant flags for specific commands are displayed.   Client enrollment and TLS flags added on server/ca side to support intermediate CA (acting like a client) configuration through command line.   ></description> </Issue>

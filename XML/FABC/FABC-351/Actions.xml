CDATA ok so I send reason as a string and it works.  I went back a week or so and we were sending it as an integer and it worked fine. Then switched on that build so it was a String and it failed.  So this had to  be a change. At any case sending it as a integer seems to work except the client gets back a 400 but on the faba-ca logs its a  200 which is still an issue.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The problem turned out to be in CFSSL code, and there are actually multiple problems as I dove into it:  1) logging the wrong message  2) returning the wrong HTTP status code  3) doesn't allow using our own error codes  The bottom line is that CFSSL's error handling code is not extensible and just not very good.  So we're going to stop using CFSSL for error handling and fixing this will be part of the overall improvement for error handling in FAB-3581.   See that FAB for more info on the design.           ></body> </Action>

CDATA The enroll command returns the following error ... {code} # fabric-ca client enroll -config client-config.json admin adminpw https://localhost:7054 open -port: no such file or directory {code}  This is a very confusing error and users will be lost as to why we are trying to open a file named "-port". This is because there is a bug in how the enroll command checks to see if there is an optional argument when it uses "len(args)" because it does not take into account optional args.   ></description> </Issue>

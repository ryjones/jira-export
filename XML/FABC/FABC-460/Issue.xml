CDATA While trying to use byfn for a composer tutorial it's possible to handle the fact that the tls certs have hostnames defined which do not exist, by using the grpc facility to override the hostname.   There doesn't appear to be a documented way to do something similar when using the fabric-ca-client. The node-sdk provides the ability to use TLS but not to verify the certificate rather than override the hostname and again there doesn't appear to be a documented way to do something similar.  This would be useful for testing in a development environment (ie single machine)  ></description> </Issue>

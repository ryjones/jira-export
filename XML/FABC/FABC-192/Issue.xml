CDATA fabric-ca fvt tests need make target to build in docker  The README.md in scripts/fvt seems either dated or was never merged. There is no make target for docker-fvt. As a developer or maintainer, I should be able to simply run the tests without any secret handshaking necessary. Anyone randomly pulling the source should be able to build and run all tests from the Makefile.  ></description> </Issue>

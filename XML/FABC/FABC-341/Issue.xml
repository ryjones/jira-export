CDATA The current default expiration for all certificates created by the fabric-ca-server is approximately 1 year.  After searching, there is no standard expiration for CA certs; however, I did find the following values were in line with what was generally recommended.  1) CA root certificate expiration: approximately 15 years 2) CA intermediate certificate expiration:  approximately 5 years 3) Issued enrollment certificates expiration: approximately 1 year  Change the fabric-ca-server's to these values.     ></description> </Issue>

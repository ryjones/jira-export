CDATA  ~keithsmith  I think allowing the "adminstrator" who is tied to the signing certificate (assuming we support multiple root / intermediate authorities) should be sufficient.  I guess that maps to "registrar" in terms of the implementation as I'd assume "registrar" roles are tied to a specific issuing authority  I would certainly hope that this is just access control handler applied to the current cfssl revoke endpoint  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It's weird in that "cfssl revoke" assumes you are running on the server itself and doesn't go over the wire, but they do provide a REST API for it. Anyway, I'm working on adding "cop client unenroll" which goes over the wire, checks the ACLs, completely removes the enrollment ID from the user DB, and also adds to CRL in the cfssl DB.   The last part is all that "cfssl revoke" does.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Seems like we have two options: # don't allow clients to set the expiration and just use the expiry set in the signing profile # make sure the requested expiry is earlier than the expiry set in the signing profile rather than the CA's expiration  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I would say option 1 would be more preferable because: * Only very few use cases are expected where a user reallly needs to set the expiry as per option 2 * Currently the default fabric-ca-client cannot set the expiry, and even if we disable the feature there  will be no effect  for most people * In option 2, when the user tried to set a too late date, the server should return an error and the client should give the user the reason of the error. This would complicate operational considerations  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, it is still possible to recreate. Fortunately, that's easier now that the ci tests are checked in.  Beware that you should be prepared to kill the container. It will eventually lock up your workstation.     On the host machine cd to fabric-ca src root and place this file there:   ^cdp_exploit.sh   make it executable: {code:java} chmod +x ./cdp_exploit.sh{code} build the test image {code:java} make docker-fvt{code} run the test inside the container {code:java} docker run -v $PWD:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca -ti hyperledger/fabric-ca-fvt ./cdp_exploit.sh{code}              ></body> </Action>

CDATA The only way to really fix this is in CFSSL code. So rather than doing a partial solution in fabric-ca code, I suggest abandoning 9817 and just pushing a solution into CFSSL. I've opened an issue against cfssl at https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/issues/775. The place to fix this is going to be in cfssl/revoke/revoke.go.   All calls to ioutil.ReadAll should be changed to read into a fixed size buffer. There may be other places which require this as well.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Please help answer the above set of questions - so customers can be better guided with official documentation behind.  I have my own personal opinion - a well formed, structured, constituted, evolving and thriving permissioned blockchain network can not be without a running, live Fabric CA server for application identities and SSL functioning at TLS layer. I also believe it is needed for dynamism and liveness - to dynamically reach to needs of network members. However this is my personal opinion.     Question is - what is Hyperledger Fabric stated, recommended wisdom? It needs to be documents and guided in a timely manner.     Thanks.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA What if we get to the next comment indicated below here  fictitious and I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS STATEMENT - I AM MAKING UP :  Customers making statements - such as "RAFT consensus or IBP consensus components are not allowed into our Enterprise by our Kafka/ZKP teams" Some blockchain practitioners making statements such as - "RAFT consensus or IBP consensus components are not required since documentation says - OpenRAFT can be used  OpenRAFT is my invention and there is no such thing... "  If you remove live CA or live consensus nodes from network and explain that everything can be done in offline or non-live or out-of-band mode - then well - why do we need anything live?  One of the tenets of well architected and well setup Blockchain network is - bounded time consensus resolution and growing the blockchain block height - so the committed transactions gets more trusted to be not changeable/tamper-evident.  Again all my opinions and we need to document clearly what is minimal and non-negotiable network components.  Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

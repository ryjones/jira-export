CDATA Prior to issuing an enroll operation within the TestEnrollCLI test, a configuration file is setup within a temporary directory -- /tmp/client<random-number>.  The configuration file within the temporary directory is intended to be a hard link that is created using the *os.Link("../../testdata/client-config2.json", clientConfig)* statement.  If the testdata/client-config2.json file and intended hard link (value of clientConfig) are on different filesystem boundaries or span disk partitions, the hard link will NOT be created.  This will result in a cli/client unit test failure (TestEnrollCLI) and the following error messages are displayed:  13:59:45 --- FAIL: TestEnrollCLI (10.00s) 13:59:45 	client_test.go:62: Failed to register, err:  Failed to load client config file  open /tmp/client619326020/client-config.json: no such file or directory ; not sending  Perhaps symbolic links could be used instead of hard links.  ></description> </Issue>

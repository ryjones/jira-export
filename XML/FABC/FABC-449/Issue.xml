CDATA Fabric CA code needs to be refactor, there are various improvements that can be made to the code base. A few improvements that come to mind are:  1. Split lib into two separate client and server packages 2. Use interfaces rather than actual types in struct definitions as much as possible. Only Config objects should really be defined as pointers, everything else can be interfaces. 3. Need to create distinction between unit-tests and integration test, and then write and move tests to appropriate locations. 4. Command line code needs to be more split and be more object oriented by moving the variables it needs to their respective structures and moving as much out of the clientcmd structures. The same changes are need on the server side commands.  ></description> </Issue>

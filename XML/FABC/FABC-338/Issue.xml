CDATA I am able to query a peer from an Org that was removed from the channel. The query returns data from the last state when it was still part of the channel.  Note: I am not able to do any invokes (Transaction proposal gives an error "Org3MSP is unknown").  I expected the query to fail similar to the invoke.  Following are steps to recreate this scenario. # Create a network with 3 Orgs, 2 Peers per Org, 3 CA, 3 Orderers, 4 KF, 3 ZK. # Create a Channel with 2 Orgs. # Join 2 Peers per Org into the Channel. # Install chaincode on all peers. # Instantiate chaincode. # Invoke on peer0 Org 1 (put value : 10) # Add Org3 to channel (configtxlator and channel update) # Invoke on peer0 Org 3 (put value : 20) # Query on peer0 Org 3  (20) # Remove Org3 from channel (configtxlator and channel update) # Invoke on peer1 Org 1 (put value : 30) # Query on peer1 Org 1 (30) # Query on peer1 Org 2 (30) # {color:#ff0000}Query on peer1 Org 3 (20) (We are getting the old value){color} # {color:#14892c}Invoke on peer0 Org1 by a user from Org3 Fails. {color}  {color:#14892c}I also tried a scenario where Org3 was never added to channel. Both the invokes and queries are failing in this case as expected. {color}  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="27608" issue="18767" author="bmos299" type="comment" body=" ~xixuejia  this could be a security issue.  If you have any org that was removed for any reason, they could be using functionality for a DDOS type attack as this call is using cpu cycles.   Also, depending on how the query data is used, it could cause general misunderstanding of state.

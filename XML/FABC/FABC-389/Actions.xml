CDATA If they provide both and the cert with the matching SN && AKI doesn't belong to the EID, we would need to return an error. I'm trying to see the value in doing this. I guess it could provide an extra layer of sanity checking before revoking a cert, but not sure how valuable it is. Allen, is this what you were thinking?   ></body> </Action>

CDATA 1 - For one, yes, it's just a sanity check. Granted, the chances of having two certs with the same SN, AKI and owner are small, minuscule perhaps (and if compliant with the PKI specifications, impossible), but it would give me as a user, a higher degree of confidence that I had targeted the correct user.  2 - In reviewing previous operations it is more clearly apparent on inspection, just which user was intended to be targeted.  3 - Then there's just the argument from the purist perspective. The input is logically consistent and it is confusing when it's rejected.   ></body> </Action>

<Action id="21927" issue="15414" author="aambati" type="comment" body=" ~rennman  is this still happening? Looking at the code it seems to look for aki and serial , if provided then it will try to revoke the cert associated with them. If aki/serial is not provided, then it will look for identity name, if there it will try to revoke the identity. If neither name or aki/serial is provided, an error is returned." created="2017-04-06 16:20:22.0" updateauthor="aambati" updated="2017-04-06 16:20:22.0"/>

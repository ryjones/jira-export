The original scripts never accounted for a number of servers greater than 10. In particular, one verification function fails if the number of servers is &gt; 10. In addition there were numerous polling timers which bore optimization. Lastly, some hard-coded sleeps, which were necessary during the nascent development stage are no longer needed. Consequently, the runtime for the fvt tests is reduced by up to 40%" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-07-11 16:43:16.0" updated="2019-07-27 14:59:58.0" resolutiondate="2017-11-30 17:28:25.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="32728"/>

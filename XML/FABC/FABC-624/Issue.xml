CDATA Currently we are able to set the logging level via the CLI (command line interface) of the *peer*: ex:  -e CORE_PEER_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug  but we cannot do so for the Membership Services server.   The only way, currently, to specify the logging level is via the *membersrvc.yml*, specifically using this section: {quote} logging: # Please see fabric/docs/Setup/logging-control.md for more # options. server: debug ca: debug eca: debug ecap: debug ecaa: debug aca: debug acap: debug tca: debug tcap: debug tcaa: debug tlsca: debug{quote}  Indeed, we should probably add the ability to have a more flexible mechanism that is specifiable via the CLI.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Agree that we need a simple way, but you can control anything in the yaml via env variables today.  For example, export MEMBERSRVC_CA_LOGGING_SERVER=debug to enable debug logging for server.go   ></body> </Action>

CDATA MS doesn't have a CLI, it has a binary. We should be consistent in how we treat configuration across our portfolio of tools (peer, membersrvc, chaintool, etc). To  ~smithbk  point, while a bit clunky, that does work. Since most of these will be run in Docker containers, and likely via Compose, this isn't really a bad thing.    While I agree we should be looking to make things easier, I don't know that we need to pursue this now.  ></body> </Action>

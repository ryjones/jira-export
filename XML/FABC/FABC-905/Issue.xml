CDATA The `fabric-ca-server` currently constructs a `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` file when initialised or started. This file stores the passwords of all initial identities (including the bootstrap admin identity when LDAP is disabled) in plaintext form.  This is bad practice as anyone with read access to these configuration files could potentially register and enroll arbitrary identities given the bootstrap identity credentials ( CWE 256| https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-details/256/Plaintext-Storage-of-a-Password.html  ). An alternative method should be used to store these passwords such as hashing or local shell variables.  Attached image shows an example ofÂ `fabric-ca-server-config.yaml` when bootstrapping the server with credentials "admin:adminpw" (i.e. `fabric-ca-server -b admin:adminpw`).  Suggested fix:  We should allow the user to specify a password file to use, that way it can be written before launch or a k8s secret can be used.  * add a new option to the config called `pass_file` * if set, the `pass_file` should take precedence over the existing `pass`. Read the contents as plaintext and use them in place of the existing password variable on the server.  ></description> </Issue>

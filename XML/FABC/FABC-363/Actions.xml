<Action id="30248" issue="20193" author="keysjrw" type="comment" body="Experienced the same issue with a local postgres. Identified that it works when using user postgress with a password. Also works remotely with user postgres. I assigned full access to a custom username in postgres, but it would not work. Either I failed to properly assign rights to this custom user or something is hard-coded to user postgres. I could not identify which. Init, start, register, and enroll now work using 2 CA VMs with a third VM running postgres for both with username postgres and a password. If it can be shown that a custom username works then this issue should be closed. Else it should be noted why user postgres is required or modified to allow custom user names in postgres." created="2017-08-28 09:18:34.0" updateauthor="keysjrw" updated="2017-08-28 09:18:34.0"/>

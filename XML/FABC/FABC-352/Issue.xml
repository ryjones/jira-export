CDATA AKI and serial are stored in the database with no leading zeros. However, when using openSSL command line to get serial or AKI from a certificate there are times when these might contain a leading zero.   Need to make lookup logic more robust to accept a leading zero or not when doing a look up against the certificate table using serial or AKI.   ></description> </Issue>

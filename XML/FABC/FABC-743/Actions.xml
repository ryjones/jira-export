CDATA CA health is a function of: - server up - database available  In terms of server up, if we can respond to the health check, we're "up."  For the database, we have three options: sqlite, postgres, and mysql. A ping operation already exists for all three of the backends so the health check would simply drive the existing operation on the configured database.  Ping is the same interface on all backends and already tested.  Likely need to create additional stories for authorization and a separate separate server.  ></body> </Action>

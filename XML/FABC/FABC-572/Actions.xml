CDATA Relating to this issue, "fabric-ca-client register" command fails when upper case character is used at affiliation section of fabric-ca-server-config.yaml and "id.affiliation" parameter of register command.  The reason is as followings. * In fabric-ca-server-config.yaml: "key" characters of YAML's "key:value" node are changed to lower case by Viper and stored in DB. (https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/371) * At "fabric-ca-client register" command: "id.affiliation" parameter is case sensitive.  User can define "key" value at affiliations section in fabric-ca-server-config.yaml. So, this issue is occurred (probably) only when upper case character is used in "id.affiliation" parameter.  I think it's suitable for this issue that register command changes characters in "id.affiliation" parameter to lower case.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~tsrb   If this is a required feature, then automatic character case converting should also added to fabric sdks to make alignment, I think.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Fabric-CA commands are sent to fabric-ca-server by REST API. So, "converting process" is needed in fabric-ca-server only. But I don't know "affiliations is case insensitive" is correct spec or not.  Does anyone know the spec?  ></body> </Action>

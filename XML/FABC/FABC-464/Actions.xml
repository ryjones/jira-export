CDATA Having continuous port ranges provide benefits: * You can create only 1 firewall rule for them by stating the range 7050-->7054 * You can perhaps leverage that information when you parse logs of network traffic- catch everything with 705,(70500 is above the maximum port number). * It's uniform and easy to remember  I think it's a good idea as this should be done as soon as possible. The later we do this, the more confusion it will cause IMO.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The goal of this story is allow fabric-ca to use Updatable CRI to avoid the need to regenerate the CRI each time a new user enroll. CRI regeneration should happen only at revocation time. This means also that the enrolled user gets only the part of the CRI that is needed to generate valid idemix signatures. This reduces the communication complexity. To get the full CRI, the endpoint */api/v1/idemix/cri* can be used.  Impact on *lib/server/idemix/enroll.go*      ></description> </Issue>

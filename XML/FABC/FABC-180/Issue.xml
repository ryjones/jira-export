CDATA Currently, fabric-ca-server enforces that the input <filename> passed to the -config arg ends with .json, .yml, or .yaml (there may be others, but I can confirm these)  It will not accept filenames without an extension, nor with extensions it does not recognize.  This does not appear to be a restriction for the fabric-ca-client command.  I propose that the command accept any valid filename, for both consistency and convenience to the user.  ></description> </Issue>

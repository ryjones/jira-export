CDATA  ~skarim , hi Saad, may I get your issue clear?  Does what you mean here is to  # to make userInfo be included in the User object struct // @ client.go # thus, GetUser function returns the User object which contains the userInfo # switch the calls to GetUserInfo with GetUser function and specify the member value "userInfo" (eg. "User.userInfo") as the output arguments.  Thanks  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~luomin   Take a look at this work in progress changeset that I had started. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/14741/0  The GetUserInfo function in dbaccessor.go needs to be removed. Once we remove this function, anywhere in the code that called GetUserInfo needs to be replaced with GetUser. This might require expanding on the User interface defined in lib/spi/userregistry.go and adding any new functions to get GetUser to do all the things that GetUserInfo was used for. GetUser function should still continue to return the User interface.  ></body> </Action>

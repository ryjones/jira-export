CDATA We are not required to scan Vendor package and other directory , e.g. *bddtest ,* that is not part of Fabric and fabric-ca mage. Also , the output should be in HTML format.  Here is the command that I used for my scanning :  *gas -skip=/Users/ash/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/vendor/* -skip=/Users/ash/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bddtests/* -fmt=html -out=scanresult.html ./...*  These scans should be run fabric-ca repository also.  The output of scan should be retained somewhere on some server and in the event of scan failing , an email should go to mailing list consisting of squad leads :  Srinivasan Muralidharan  David Eneyeart  Jim Zhang  Kostas  Keith Smith  Barry  Ashutosh Kumar  Binh Nguyen  Gari Singh  There is no way the scan not to throw error. There will be false positives , which will make scan fail. Team will fix vulnerabilities identified , but currently , there is no way to eliminate false positives.                    ></body> </Action>

CDATA This tool reports lots of "undeclared name" errors for things that are actually defined. See https://github.com/GoASTScanner/gas/issues/113 which currently says a fix may be in the experimental branch.  ~jtclark  I think this tool is unusable until we get a version of gas with this fix.  I suggest trying the experimental branch.  ></body> </Action>

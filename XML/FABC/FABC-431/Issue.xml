CDATA We should be able to use our struct introspection code to write out the config file with comments defined in tags.  This means we can delete the server and client template files in the code and will be easier to maintain.  But the bigger change is to support options to save flags and env variables to the config file when creating it, or with an option to modify it after it is created.  Something like:  fabric-ca-server cfg update --ca.name foo  ></description> </Issue>

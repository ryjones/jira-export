CDATA Implement the following cop client command: cop client reenroll <copServerURL>  This uses the existing private key associated with the client to sign a request for a new certificate.   It is the same as "cop client enroll" except instead of using a one-time user name and password to authenticate the user for initial enrollment, the user is authenticated based upon the signature of the existing private key for the client.

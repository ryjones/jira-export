CDATA Instead of storing all enrollment artifacts in a single client.json file, store it in separate key and store files.  This is inline with MSP (Membership Service Provider) APIs.  The enrollment certificate is stored at `$COP_ENROLLMENT_DIR/cert.pem` by default, but a different path can be specified by setting the `COP_CERT_FILE` environment variable.  The enrollment key is stored at `$COP_ENROLLMENT_DIR/key.pem` by default, but a different path can be specified by setting the `COP_KEY_FILE` environment variable.  The default value of the `$COP_ENROLLMENT_DIR` environment variable is `$COP_HOME`.  The default value of the `$COP_HOME` environment variable is `$HOME/.cop`.  ></description> </Issue>

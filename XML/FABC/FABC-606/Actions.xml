CDATA Hey  ~corecode   First of all, I'm really glad we share the same view on this. Second, yes, this is much preferable!  I gave a talk last week about scalability (the talk focused mostly on Fabric's Membership Services' work-in-progress, challenges and where we want to be)... and this is one of the issues that came up (from bootsrapping a small private, permissioned chain... all the way to mass-configuring, large set-ups, etc.).  One of the items was the server's policy... in the sense of, what can we enforce/require from 'adhering' clients. Instead of hard-coded username-password, Client Authentication can/may be key here! Several setups may include servers that require client auth.  Will try to break this to smaller sub tasks, promote these, split the work (, try to use some of yours) etc., ... but the first 3 things that sprang to mind when I read your comment are 1. yes, 2. yes and 3. yes!  Thanks a lot.     ></body> </Action>

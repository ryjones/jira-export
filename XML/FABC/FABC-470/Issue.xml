CDATA Hello  I noticed that when configuring fabric CA (rel 1.0.2) with TLS server enabled, and called by the fabric-ca client CLI on HTTP URL (e.g: -u  http://ca1.example.com:7054|http://ca1.example.com:7054/  instead of -u  https://ca1.example.com:7054)|https://ca1.example:7054)  , the response is some garbled binary output and not some proper HTTP error message.  Could reproduce using curl traces.  This is annoying for clients with improper configurations, as the error is difficult to interpret.        ></description> </Issue>

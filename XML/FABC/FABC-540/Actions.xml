CDATA  ~rennman Allen, I think this is an user error. I think you need to specify -config option. I think you will not see this error if you specify -config option.  /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/bin/fabric-ca-client -d revoke -u http://localhost:8888 --eid admin2 -config <config location>  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The command is using the config path,  $CA_CFG_PATH, but looking for the default file name  "fabric-ca-server-config.yaml", which is not the config file for this particular server instance.  When Keith, Anil, Saad and I discussed around 04/07/2017 we determined that one potential solution to this problem was to hard-code the config file name, disallowing a user-defined name, but I don't know what the final decision was.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Since the "-c" option is part of v1, I think the best option is to continue to support it but to remove it from all documentation and from the usage message (see https://godoc.org/github.com/spf13/pflag#FlagSet.MarkHidden).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'd love to see the -c option in the documentation as before. I was very surprised and confused it disappeared in the last versions. The -c option is very helpful for testing and debugging (especially in docker environments), I just have to pass a configuration file and not a directory. Let's say, I create a directory conf, and I put inside three configuration files for my tests : fabric-ca-client-config-dev.yaml, fabric-ca-client-config-staging.yaml, fabric-ca-client-config-prod.yaml, I can easily test my commands by passing them through the -c option. But with the -H option, I add to create three directories, and call them dev, staging, prod and copy my files inside. It is extremely verbose when mounting volumes in a docker environment for example.  I think it is totally usual that you can define the CFG_PATH globally and override it for every command for testing. The contrary as described in the first post is wrong in my opinion.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="46235" issue="15413" author="skarim" type="comment" body=" ~GuillaumeCisco  The -c option is still there and can be used as it was used before, it has just been merely hidden. The -H flags was added to increase usability and by not having to require the -c flag on each subsequent command after enroll. But if you wish to use -c flag, you may do so." created="2018-06-19 20:50:35.0" updateauthor="skarim" updated="2018-06-19 20:50:35.0"/>

CDATA  ~skarim  The -c option should be documented so... Why hiding it? It does look like the -H option has to be used on each subsequent command too. Which is totally normal and expected to me. If you want to set the directory globaly, use a global variable. If I want to override it, I use a cli option. Furthermore in my opinion using a directory instead of a file is not the best solution as I explained it above.  ></body> </Action>

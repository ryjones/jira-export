CDATA There is a mixture of terminology used in fabric-ca for affiliation groups.  It is called group and affiliation.  The code needs to be changed to use affiliation throughout.  The term "group" would be confusing because users can be a member of multiple groups, but a user can only be associated with a single affiliation, thus the name affiliation is better.  Change the name of the table from "groups" to "affiliations".  This table has two columns: path and prekey.  We really only need to store the root prekey but doesn't hurt to store all of them.  The root prekey is the row with path equal to the empty string.  That said, another approach is to have a separate table with a single row which contains columns for multiple "singleton" type information.  For now, the table would have only two columns: name which is always "fabric-ca-server" and prekey which is the value of the root prekey.  We could add columns as needed.    ></description> </Issue>

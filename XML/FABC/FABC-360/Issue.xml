CDATA  EDITED BY JONATHAN:   *Background/Context* We have spent some time (Mon/Tue) trying to figure out why the COP server/executable throws NPE when an enrollment request is received, please see more details here https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1591  *Synopsis* Apparently, we have learned that if/when the cop server was initially launched without having the ca_cert and the ca_key in the json config file. ,  *How to Reproduce* Build the latest cop from the master branch (v1), start it with the default (the 0.0.0.0:8888 binding, etc.) and try to make an enrollment request.   Greg Haskins  wrote a simple script that does that, I  Jonathan Levi , could reproduce using the node test/unit/end-to-end.js.  *Known Workaround* When initially starting the *cop* server, you currently have to use the use the *-ca* and *-ca-key* command line options - otherwise, the server throws NPE when it receives an enroll request.   ></description> </Issue>

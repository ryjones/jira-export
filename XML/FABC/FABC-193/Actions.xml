CDATA Just for history's sake, regarding above comment. We traced this with Keith, CA will fail to start with an explicit RSA key. As a workaround, if somebody ablsolutely needs it, I believe one can stick RSA pem key into BCCSP keystore,  Â   It was agreed by Keith and Gari not to pursue more RSA support work. If it is to be resurected, see:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9437/    https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9433/   ></body> </Action>

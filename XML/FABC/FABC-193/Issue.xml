CDATA 1. Server fails to start if an RSA key and certificate are provided to the fabric-ca server.  The following errors are seen: Error: Could not find the private key in BCCSP keystore nor in keyfile rsa-key.pem: Failed to import RSA key from rsa-key.pem; RSA private key import is not supported  *Reproduction steps:* 1. Make sure that you don't have an existing certificate or key file that server has used. Clean up keystore and any certificate. 2. Run the following command:  fabric-ca-server start --ca.certfile testdata/rsa.pem --ca.keyfile testdata/rsa-key.pem -d -b a:b  The rsa.pem and rsa-key.pem are under the fabric-ca/testdata directory   2. Server ends up overriding an exisiting certifcate file and create a new key. Using an PKCS8 version of the an rsa key with and rsa certificate, caused the fabric-ca server to override the exisiting rsa certificate and create a new key in the key store.  *Reproduction steps:* 1. Run the following command: fabric-ca-server start --ca.certfile testdata/rsa.pem --ca.keyfile testdata/rsa-key.pcks8.pem -d -b a:b  rsa-key.pcks8.pem is attached to this work item  ></description> </Issue>

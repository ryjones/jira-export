CDATA a. Internal server errors (500) need to be eliminated (as much as possible/reasonable)  b. less information should be returned to client. Messages like: Error: Response from server: Error Code: 45 - Failed to verify if user can act on type 'user': : scode: 401, local code: 42, local msg: 'restrictedAdmin' is not a registrar, remote code: 20, remote msg: Authorization failure and Failed to add identity: Identity 'admin' may not register type 'role1' should be changed to 403 (or 404)  c. some of the classifications are just wrong. e.g., in some auth cases we return statusCode=400 (400 Bad Request) Error: Response from server: Error Code: 50 -  when the request is perfectly valid. Bad request implies bad syntax; should be 403/404  d. Some remote error codes are returning a value of '0'.  ></description> </Issue>

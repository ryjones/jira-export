CDATA This is Bhargav and I tried getting this running in my SKYTAP hosted cloud and in a locally running VM on my laptop.  I did not succeed in being able to run this script.   Attached is failure log and Keith knows this issue per our emails and sametime chats.   ^fabric-ca-cryptogen_consoleoutput_V1.log   I am posting this comment in order to see this *not working issue* slip thru' the cracks.     Thanks.        ></body> </Action>

We are not able to generate certificates with crypto-gen that is CA compatible, with our topology. The success of our project depends on this feature.

CDATA hi, thanks for this script about using ca instead of crytogen. and i run it locally with the fabric1.0.1  I found there is no tls cert created but all other cets and keys seemed to be fine.  Ah, it works, i forget to change the ca path in the top of this scripts. Thanks. And i'll check its validity by using those certs and keys to create a network.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I just make some change with the sript and that runs well with tls enable. And i have uploaded the scrip named fabric-ca-cryptogen-tls.sh and the relevant byfn.sh  You could download that two files and place it in the fabric-samples/fist-network  And then as usual use the byfn.sh to generate up and down.   It works with fabric1.0.1 and fabric-ca1.0.1  ></body> </Action>

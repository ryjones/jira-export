CDATA Currently, the documentation states: {{--csr.hosts stringSlice A list of space-separated host names in a certificate signing request}}  However, the host names should be comma separated.  Also, if both commas and spaces are used, the resulting CSR will be corrupted, since the spaces are taken as part of the hostname, and things like IP addresses will not be detected properly.  For example {{--csr.hosts "host1 host2 10.0.0.1"}} will result in the incorrect {{"DNS:host1 host2 10.0.0.1"}} {{--csr.hosts "host1, host2, 10.0.0.1"}} will result in the incorrect {{"DNS:host1, DNS:{color:#ff0000}_host2{color}, DNS:{color:#ff0000}_10.0.0.1{color}"}} but {{--csr.hosts "host1,host2,10.0.0.1"}} will result in the correct {{"DNS:host1, DNS:host2, IP Address:10.0.0.1"}}  Note the extra space preceding {{host2}} and that {{10.0.0.1}} is not recognized as an IP Address, but rather as a DNS host with a leading space.  ></description> </Issue>

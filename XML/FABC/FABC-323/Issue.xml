CDATA If a client/identity uses an Idemix credential to send a reenroll request, this request should not be honored by the Fabric CA Server. Currently, if you send a reenroll request using Idemix credential than an x509 certificate ends up getting generated even though this identity never posses an x509 certificate to begin with.  A check should be made to see what type of credential is being used when handling a reenroll request, if a Idemix credential was used and appropriate error message should be returned back to user and the request should fail.

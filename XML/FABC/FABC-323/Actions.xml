CDATA Why do we not allow an idemix cred to be used on reenroll?  If this is something we aren't supporting for v1.2, that is fine, but am trying to understand why we would limit it.  Just a quick thought ...   For a future release, we should  consider something more generic than enroll/reenroll now that we have two types of credentials, like a fabric-ca-client getcredential which allows two options: 1) type of input authentication data to use (user/pass, x509, or idemix) 2) type of output/credential to produce (x509 or idemix) and where to store the credential  We would keep enroll and reenroll for backwards compatibility, but getcredential would be more generic and I think less confusing?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~smithbk  Talking with Anil there is no concept of reenrollment for an idemix credential. Currently, if an identity issues a reenroll request when they *only* posses an Idemix credential they end up getting an x509 certificate. Talking with Anil, this seems like an odd behavior so a check was added that makes sure a re-enrollment is issued only if caller is using an x509 certificate.   Also, the the approach going forward of adding an new command sounds good and I can open a JIRA to track this.  ></body> </Action>

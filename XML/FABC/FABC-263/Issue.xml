CDATA My enrollment certificates tend to have a serial # with 40 hex chars, e.g.  7b07302b35cf4dcf3a368d26d8eeeb9e48e5a61d  However, the DB entries have a leading 0:   VALUES('admin','07b07302b35cf4dcf3a368d26d8eeeb9e48e5a61d','1b88a307e17c118ad9ea5d8ffaf88f73be522b96' ...  Consequently, a revoke invocation fails with 404 not found.  If I supply the leading 0 to the --serial value, it succeeds.  Whether or not the leading is either in the DB, or part of the command-line argument for that matter, it should be recognized as a number. (Ideally, the command should allow hex or decimcal, but I can live with requiring hex, provided it's documented.)  ></description> </Issue>

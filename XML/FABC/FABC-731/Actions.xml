CDATA As I understand the error occurs because you can not register new user via fabric when ldap enabled. We have very misleading error messages - at first it show something like _"'admin2' with affiliation of 'org2' is not authorized to get 'testuser' with affiliation of 'hyperledger'_, after you set proper affiliations for admin and user - it just fails with _"code":0,"message":"Registration of 'user' failed in affiliation validation: Failedgetting affiliation 'users': Not supported" ._  Would be better if error message will notify that you ca no register new users when ldap enabled.  Â   Regarding compsoer i still can user it, just use compose identity bind instead of composer identity issue  ></body> </Action>

CDATA To reproduce need to enable and configure ldap in fabic ca,  then deploy any test network based on composer, like  https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks/tree/master/packages/trade-network   create demo participant _composer participant add -c admin@sp -d '\{"$class": "org.example.trading.Trader","tradeId": "TRADER1","firstName": "Jenny","lastName": "Jones"}'_ and the issue identity for participant _composer identity issue -c admin@sp -f test.card --participantId_ "org.example.trading.Trader#TRADER1" -u trader this command send register new identity request to fabric-ca which will cause first error  ></body> </Action>

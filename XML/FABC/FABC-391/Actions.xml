<Action id="29127" issue="19542" author="aambati" type="comment" body=" ~JonathanLevi   The root cause of the problem is that String method was defined for CAConfigIdentity as pointer receiver instead of non-pointer receiver. Because _CAConfig.Register.Identities_ is an array of CAConfigIdentity, when CAConfig is logged, String method of CAConfigIdentity is not being used. After I changed String method to non-pointer receiver, it started using String method when CAConfig is logged. String method of CAConfigIdentity will mask the field that is tagged &apos;secret&apos;" created="2017-07-28 02:49:14.0" updateauthor="aambati" updated="2017-07-28 02:49:14.0"/>

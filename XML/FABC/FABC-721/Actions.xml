CDATA A few questions: # Has a task been opened already to rewrite, as was suggested needed doing? It would be helpful to link it to "relate to" this jira. # Can we explain better why this is being removed? # And is there an urgency to do it now, without doing the refactor first? If not, then could we hold off on this until that gets done, to avoid leaving a hole in our test coverage?  ></body> </Action>

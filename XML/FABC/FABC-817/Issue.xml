CDATA As of now, the dist-all target creates the fabric-ca-client binary for supporting platforms and creates a tar file for each platform.  Can I make a request to include the 'fabric-ca-server' in the same path with dist-all, This would make it easy to get both binaries in the folder and in tar format with a single make target.  ></description> </Issue>

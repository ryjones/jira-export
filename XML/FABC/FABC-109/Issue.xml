Currently the rc is out of scope of the main script due to the fact that when the shell opens a pipe to &apos;tee&apos; it operates in a new subshell environment, replete with it&apos;s own I/O stream and variable set. The run_fvt_tests script will be re-written using process substitution to simplify the return code logic.Â " priority="2" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-05-18 17:14:29.0" updated="2018-07-18 22:03:32.0" resolutiondate="2017-05-24 13:07:56.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="32289"/>

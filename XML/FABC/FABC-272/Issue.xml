CDATA From a debug statement in genCRLHandler() fromÂ  lib/servergencrl.go, the crl is printed in raw binary. This change would print the standard string representation of a   byte stream: - log.Debugf("Successfully generated CRL: %s\n", crl) + log.Debugf("Successfully generated CRL: %v\n", crl)  Also, there are a couple of debugging statements in  lib/client.go lib/ca.go where the string substitution is not happening properly (the '%s' is printed, and not the value). This would fix those instances.  ></description> </Issue>

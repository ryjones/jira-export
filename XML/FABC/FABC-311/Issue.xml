CDATA For the composer dev environment we build a simple fabric with a fabric ca server without a config file and just use admin:adminpw.   We want to then use this fabric-ca server to provide identities that can only be enrolled once, so as part of the registration of a new identity we specify maxenrollments of 1. However the fabric-ca server overrides this and sets the user to -1 ignoring our request.  I have tried to set the maxenrollments value for the server using environment variables so that I set maxenrollments to a large value. This works but then the server fails with an error because the default bootstrap id of admin has a maxenrollments set to -1 and is not allowed.  ></description> </Issue>

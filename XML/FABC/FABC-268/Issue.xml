CDATA The empty string is the root of the affiliation hierarchy. The empty string affiliation should be recognized as an affiliation on the following command, and assuming the user is authorized to register an identity with this affiliation, it should not return an error as shown below.  {code} # fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 # fabric-ca-client register --id.name foo --id.type peer --id.affiliation "" 2017/08/09 09:37:38  INFO  User provided config file: /Users/keith/.fabric-ca-client/fabric-ca-client-config.yaml 2017/08/09 09:37:38  INFO  Configuration file location: /Users/keith/.fabric-ca-client/fabric-ca-client-config.yaml Error: Registration request does not have an affiliation {code}  The easiest work-around is to use the bootstrap username and password to enroll since this identity has the empty string as it's affiliation.  ></description> </Issue>

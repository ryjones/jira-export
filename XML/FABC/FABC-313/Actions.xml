CDATA According to this  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21421  , this is expected behavior.   From  https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2849  :  You cannot statically link to glibc - it uses runtime plugins for things like DNS resolution. Also it's licensed under the LGPL, which means you can do dynamic linking, but static linking means your program's source code also has to be released under the LGPL.  Besides that, it looks like a problem with Golang, by searching for that error on google this is the second result:   golang/go#21421|https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21421   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Is this really a problem when the program was built in the same docker container that it will run in?  ~mastersingh24   ~smithbk  can you pls weigh in on this     ></body> </Action>

See the final comment of https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21421.  That said, it is just a warning.  If you set FABRIC_CA_DYNAMIC_LINK=true, there are no warnings.  So I&apos;m going to close." created="2018-02-14 18:49:56.0" updateauthor="smithbk" updated="2018-02-14 18:50:35.0"/>

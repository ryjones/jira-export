CDATA Currently the fabric-ca-client is able to generate a certificate signing request and send it to the fabric-ca-server for it to generate and sign a certificate for the private key generated by the BCCSP in the msp directory.  If a user wishes to use an external CA for generating and signing the certificates, it would be useful to leverage the fabric-ca-client and BCCSP to generate a certificate signing request for the keys generated by the BCCSP and write the CSR to a file without any interaction with the fabric-ca-server. Â This would allow the user to then send the CSR file to an external CA.  The fabric-ca-client should be modified to accommodate this use case.  ></description> </Issue>

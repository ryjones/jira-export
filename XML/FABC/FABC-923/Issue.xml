CDATA fabric-ca-client reenroll is expected to renew the existing certificates. But, the command generates a new private key and thus generates a fresh set of crypto material.     Expected behavior: fabric-ca-clien reenroll renews the existing certificate using the existing private key.     Please let me know if the current behavior is as expected. Thanks in advance.  ></description> </Issue>

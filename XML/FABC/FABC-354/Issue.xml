CDATA The Java SDK makes some Fabric ca calls register enroll reenroll and revoke during it integration tests.  Most of the time these don't fail.  But every 10th run or so a failure 500 returns.  Putting in sleeps seems to have solved this.  There is no specific scenario by which I can say makes this happens. Best advise is to do stress testing of the api to try and reproduce.  ></description> </Issue>

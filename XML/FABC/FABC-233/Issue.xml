CDATA Ubuntu 16.04.1 recently updated the mysql package to version 5.7.19.  It's hard to track down exactly what changed between this version and the prior version that was installed by default, but something has changed in the install / config process.  I've taken a look at the updated mysql image on Dockerhub and will try to apply similar changes to the start script.  Of course we test on both x86_64 and s390x and unfortunately s390x is based on Debian Jessie which provides mysql 5.5.55.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA After using Fabric CA client to enroll an Identity to get back an Idemix Credential, the identity could not be used to invoke other Fabric CA commands (e.g. register, revoke, etc.). This is because the logic that loads the indentity fails if it does not find any x509 credential.  This should be revised to check for both x509 and Idemix credential. If both credentials, are not found then it should return a failure.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hey there, we are using fabric-ca and fabric-ca-* images. We started migrating from 1.2 to 1.3, and discovered fabric-ca-* are not published on docker hub anymore. Example for fabric-ca-peer:  https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-ca-peer/tags   Following https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABCI-24 , https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABC-131 and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABC-722     We can now build fabric-ca-* images by cloning 1.3 release of fabric-ca project  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/tree/release-1.3  and run: {code:java} sudo make docker-all{code}    However, in this  doc|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.3/fabric-ca  we can read: {code:java} How to use the Hyperledger Fabric CA client and server to generate all crypto material rather than using cryptogen. The cryptogen tool is not intended for a production environment because it generates all private keys in one location which must then be copied to the appropriate host or container. This sample demonstrates how to generate crypto material for orderers, peers, administrators, and end users so that private keys never leave the host or container in which they are generated.{code} From version 1.4, fabric-ca sample has been removed from fabric-samples:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples    Furthermore, images folder is no more present in fabric-ca 1.4 for building fabric-ca-* images with sudo make docker-all.  So when you say "we really should not be promoting this type of usage.", what should we do from 1.4 version?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~GuillaumeCisco  Dear Guill, per our conversation in mail list, I have some reason that why the sample is bad practice in production.   1. we will not use fabric-ca-* image as. They are experimental.   2. fabric-ca-client is used in offline environment 3.  for online environment, we use sdk to interactive with fabri-ca-server(CA service), and access to sdk program is strictly under control.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi,  I find this fabric-ca examples extremely useful and easy to understand, furthermore it allowed to build _docker-compose_ network with arbitrary organisation and number of peers. It was easy to debug as all logs were in one single dir. IMHO you should've refactored this way of setting up the environment instead of removing it...   ~davidkhala  as it was mentioned in README, cryptogen tool is also not supposed to be used in production as well as CA services, but is there any good examples of SDK how to setup the environment programatically from scratch? e.g registers identities, generate the genesis block and other artefacts needed to setup the blockchain network?  So far I haven't found any and still reading e2e tests to understand the workflow... IMHO lack of good examples and archetypes is a huge gap of Hyperledger SDK.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="55700" issue="36454" author="davidkhala" type="comment" body=" ~ihormudryy  sure it is still not enough. But I think for learner to understand the workflow, e2e is enough. For further learning, I will normally go to see the integration tests of each fabric sdk. That is the exact place to learn how to play.

CDATA  ~davidkhala   which integration test are you referring to that makes use of the fabric-ca images? I looked into the tests and I don't see any. I would assume they would be here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca      Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

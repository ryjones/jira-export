CDATA When bootstrapping a new network or peer, we sometimes end up in a state where the fabric CA telling us our password is invalid when it doesn't appear to be.  Our automation for bootstrapping is the same for each network and peer and this works most of the time.  And as you'll see from the attachment, if we decode the basic auth header that is getting sent, it does match the ID/PW configured for that user.   See attachment for more details.  Unfortunately, the last network we saw this on was deleted, so I don't have a live network to debug with, but we've seen this a few times, so I can update when we see this again.  I would like this looked at to make sure it isn't something that should be fixed in 1.0, but I've listed the fix version as 1.1 for now.   ^ca_issue_details.txt         ></description> </Issue>

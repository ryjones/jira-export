Consider using {code} code brackets {code} as I think the formatting makes it harder to follow.  But some clarification is needed here regarding how to reproduce.  Maybe even a test case that fails." created="2017-04-06 01:04:55.0" updateauthor="smithbk" updated="2017-04-06 01:05:51.0"/>

CDATA More simply stated: when admin(A),  registers delegate(D) (who in turn is authorized to registers clients *only*) D can turn around and register enduser(E) and also give delegate authority (*for any and all types*) to E.   enduser(E) can now register clients, peers, auditors and validators. Not only does this exceed the authority of 'D', but also that of 'A'.  I don't think this is what was intended.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Sorry, there's a somewhat convoluted history to this.  Originally, it was delegation_test.sh ( now in the staging directory ).  After the split of the fabric client/server executables, we lost the ability to specify multiple attributes at registration time, thereby also losing the ability to drive the test. When I made mention of this, I was informed that multiple attributes was an advanced feature that would be deferred. Hence, I did not rework delegation_test.sh when I reworked the other tests.  Good timing on the comment though, since the feature is now sitting in a change set:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9479/  ready to be tested.  I'll revisit delegation_test.sh and retest. I'm confident it's still broken because I hacked up a driver about a month ago and it failed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA It is unclear what we can do about this as these files are included in vendor/ and are not ours to rename. Suggest that you take this up with Cloud Flare or install fabric-ca into a virtualized context (we have the fabric-buildenv docker container that could be used for this purpose).  Apologies for the inconvenience. I have lowered the priority as again, there isn't much we can do to address this issue presently.  ></body> </Action>

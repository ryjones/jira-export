CDATA I was trying to register new users with CA's grpc interfaces using golang. When I tried to enroll the "admin" user, I got an error "Signature verification failed." from  ECA .  I was confused, because the enrollUser function I used was copied from the "eca_test.go" file, and when I run the command "go test" under membersrvc/ca package, those tests passed without any errors. I googled a lot about this issue, but not found anything useful. So I create this here, hope someone can give some tips. BTW, I also posted this issue on stackoverflow.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39701198/enroll-member-request-fails-with-signature-verification/39701671?noredirect=1#comment66723076_39701671   ></description> </Issue>

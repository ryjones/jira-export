CDATA  ~denyeart , let me start with a clarification, *cacerts* can actually contain multiple root certificates (only root certificates should be there). The code allow this for flexibility reasons.  Anyway, that paragraph also looks to me not relevant. I guess removing it is enough to address this FAB. Would this be okay?**  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~angelo.decaro  I'm happy if you remove that section. Just wanted your opinion on whether there was anything worth salvaging there...  About the multiple cacerts... would that be multiple cacerts from the peer's org? Due to multiple CAs associated with the org?  There remains much confusion in the msp setup. I'm hoping you can also help review/complete FABC-814 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29430/ , to address some of the confusion.  ></body> </Action>

It is just a possibility in the case one wants to create to aggregate multiple organisations under a single MSP.

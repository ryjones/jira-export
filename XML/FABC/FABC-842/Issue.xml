CDATA This Fabric CA doc topic looks incorrect:   https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-guide.html#getting-a-ca-certificate-chain-from-another-fabric-ca-server      Peer should have one root cert in its MSP *cacerts* directory from its own org.  I don't understand what this section of documentation is trying achieve by suggesting you get other certs from other org's Fabric CAs. Maybe it was a bad attempt at describing the content that goes into peer's *intermediatecerts* directory?  Regardless, I think this entire section should be cleaned up, and potentially completely removed in favor of the operations guide proposed at FABC-814 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29430/  ></description> </Issue>

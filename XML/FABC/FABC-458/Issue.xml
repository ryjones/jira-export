CDATA In order to support hyperledger in a production environment, especially when hosting many networks for other users, we need a way to easily tell if a fabric-CA is healthy. Â Simply checking if the process is running isn't enough, and looking at the logs is great for debugging a single network, but doesn't scale when trying to support many networks in a production environment.  A simple, low impact, CLI or grpc call that verified that returned status indicating whether or not a fabric-ca was healthy, or a simple check we could do on a network we were hosting for other users (so didn't require us to submit transactions) would suffice.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~smithbk   ~aambati  If it is deferred, then won't a fix in 1.2 be even more difficult?  That is, you'd have a mix of cases already in the DB.  Isn't the 1.1 fix simply a matter of lowercasing (or uppercasing) values as they are persisted, to ensure they are all the same?  I've put back into 1.1 until this question is answered.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Keith Smith Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1  There are more changes than I expected, and thinking more about this, I don't like that everything would be case sensitive (user name, type, attribute names) except affiliation. For consistency, everything should be case sensitive.   For 1.1, we should 1) document that all non-leaf affiliations in the config file are made lower-case by golang yaml, and 2) not generate any affiliations in the default config file as this has just confused users, and now that we have APIs for dynamically adding affiliations, this is the recommended way anyway.     ></body> </Action>

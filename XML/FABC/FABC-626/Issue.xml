CDATA peer/orderer cop init manual <peer-ID> <keyFile> <participant.json-file>  Manually initialize membership services in the peer or orderer.  This command may be used when you have your own CA.  It is used instead of “peer/orderer init auto” when the COP server is not being used.  For example, if you want to provide your own CA for issuing ECerts and you don’t want to use TCerts, you may use this command to initialize the peer identity information manually.  In this case, the <participant.json-file> is the one produced by “cop server init manual” command.   ></description> </Issue>

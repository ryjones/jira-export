CDATA COP must support HSM's via the PKCS11 standard.  The only current requirement is that the private key never have to leave the card.  Said another way, the requirement is that we support signing, but does not currently require that all hash or other cryptographic operations be performed on the card.  This applies to all CFSSL code which is used for creating ECerts as well as all COP-specific code used for creating TCerts.  This will be plugged into CFSSL as follows: 1) Implement the 'localSignerCheck' function based on BCCSP.   See 'localSignerCheck' in cfssl/signer/universal/universal.go. See 'bccspBackedSigner' at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3679/6/cli/server/bccspsigner.go for an implementation of this. 2) A small change in CFSSL's universal.go to allow COP to prepend bccspBackedSigner to the 'localSignerList'.  ></description> </Issue>

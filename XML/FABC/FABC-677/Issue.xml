CDATA When we try to enroll a user, the call to membersrvc fails with "Signature verification failed" message. Further investigation shows that the unmarshalling of signature R and S fields is not working correctly on lines 170-171 of ecap.go: r.UnmarshalText(sig.R) s.UnmarshalText(sig.S)  After these statement if we add a debug, we find that the value of r and s is still 0. If we change these lines to : r.SetBytes(sig.R) s.SetBytes(sig.S)  the user is enrolled correctly. Can you please provide a fix for this issue or advise any work-around?    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Pardha brought this to my attention...  It does seem strange (to me at least :-)) that Unmarshall can be simply replaced with SetBytes to make it work. Without too much digging in I'd say somehow unmarshal has been done upstream.    ~jimthematrix    ~mastersingh24  can you comment please ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA If it helps, the Signature struct is defined in ca.pb.go as: type Signature struct { 	Type CryptoType `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=type,enum=protos.CryptoType" json:"type,omitempty"` 	R      byte     `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=r,proto3" json:"r,omitempty"` 	S      byte     `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=s,proto3" json:"s,omitempty"` }  which is the same what we got when converted protofile to java class. My understanding is that at some point the proto definition was changed to use byte   but the code using that was not.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I found a way to send a byte   that gets Unmarshalled properly, the solution is no longer needed.  Please close this issue  ></body> </Action>

CDATA TLS version 1.0 is broken since years, there's a ton of literature showing why and how it's insecure. Unfortunately, fabric will accept to talk TLSv1.0, as shown here  {{// MinVersion contains the minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable.}} {{// If zero, then TLS 1.0 is taken as the minimum.}} {{MinVersion uint16}}  The fix should be that we setÂ MinVersion to be TLSv1.2.  _FWIW: this is a stopship for most proprietary products._  ></description> </Issue>

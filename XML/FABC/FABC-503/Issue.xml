CDATA On fabric-ca 1.1 to be able to remove an identity ca-server need two extra flags during start up    something like this: {code:java} command: sh -c 'fabric-ca-server start --cfg.identities.allowremove --cfg.affiliations.allowremove -b admin:adminpw -d'{code}    Expected removal of identities to  happen automatically  without passing any flags.  Could we have this feature of removal of identities supported without user having to pass these extra flags during startup command?  ></description> </Issue>

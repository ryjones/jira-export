If that is agreed, then if they are missing from config file and from commadn line, then the default behavior should be to initialize them as true; and the user can optionally DISable them by either method.  Was there a reason why it was done that way, that would prohibit us from flipping the logic?" created="2018-02-21 00:36:05.0" updateauthor="scottz" updated="2018-02-21 00:36:05.0"/>

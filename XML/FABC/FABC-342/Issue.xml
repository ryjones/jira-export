CDATA TestNewUserRegistryMySQL relies on being able to change a file access mode to be readonly. Unfortunately on vagrant this doesn't work because, at least on Windows, all files on shared volumes appear with a 777 mode which cannot be changed.  This makes the test fail.  A simple fix is to use a file on a local volume so that its access control can effectively be changed as desired.    {code:java} $ go test -v -run TestNewUserRegistryMySQL === RUN TestNewUserRegistryMySQL 2017-07-21 21:47:33.845 UTC  bccsp  GetDefault -> WARN 001 Before using BCCSP, please call InitFactories().

CDATA There are no checks on length of RDN, nor total DN for a CSR. This causes an issue for authentication, since a DN of > approx. 3700 chars causes an error related to the authentication token (presumably, since that's the most likely thing to be affected):   {code:java} 2017/04/08 14:42:59  DEBUG  Received response statusCode=400 (400 Bad request) <html><body><h1>400 Bad request</h1> Your browser sent an invalid request. </body></html> {code}  We should define a maximum length for the DN. Although the LDAP specifications do not define a maximum length for DNs, the industry standards range from approximately 255-2048. Even for multiple products within the same company, there are often no consistent rules, e.g.   ||Product|IBM® Tivoli® Directory Server|IBM z/OS® Security Server|Novell eDirectory Server|Sun Java™ System Directory Server|Microsoft® Active Directory Server|Lotus® Domino® Server|Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM)|Optimal length|| ||Max allowed|1024|1024|1024|1024|2048|255|1024|255||   ></description> </Issue>

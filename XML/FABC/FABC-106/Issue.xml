CDATA The affiliation table in fabric-ca-server's DB should contain two columns: name and prekey. The name is like a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the form "a.b.c", so the name uniquely identifies the node in the affiliation hierarchy. The prekey field is the prekey associated with the affiliation.  The root prekey is the one associated with the affiliation with the empty string, which is the root affiliation.  This must also be stored in the DB.  ></description> </Issue>

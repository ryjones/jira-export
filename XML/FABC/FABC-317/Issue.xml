CDATA The "fabric-ca-client enroll" command stores certs in MSP format, except it does not store intermediatecerts appropriately when there is a certificate chain of more than one certificate. It stores the cacerts, signedcerts, and keystore correctly. It should also store the intermediatecerts when there is a chain of more than one certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

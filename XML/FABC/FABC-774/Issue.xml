CDATA Value for environment variable *FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1.3* would always be set to true, even if the environment variable was explicitly set to another value (e.g. false). This behavior should be fixed. If environment variable is not set, the default should still be true. However, if a value has been explicitly set then value that is set should be used and the default should be overridden.  Change name from '*FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1.3*' to `*FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3*`, dots can't be used in environment variable name.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The overall epic for self-signed tcerts is at https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2441 This story adds support to the fabric-ca client library so that it can be used in a golang SDK.  In particular, the fabric-ca/lib/Identity object will have the following functions: {code} func (i *Identity) GetTCertFactory(req *api.GetTCertFactoryRequest) (*TcertFactory, error) {  func (i *TcertFactory) GetTCert() (*TCert, error) { {code} The api.GetTCertFactoryRequest will be the same as the previous api.GetTCertBatchRequest except that it has a new boolean field specifying that the tcertFactory object is to generate self-signed tcerts.  In this case, the numTCerts field is ignored; it is up to the client how many tcerts will be generated by the client, subject to the expiration/revocation of the associated ecert of course.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hello everyone, i am using fabric ca to generate my network certs, ive encountered an issue i think related to the generation of the msp cacert of peers and orderers. The problem is that the name of this cert is generated by a combination of parameters that are: the url and port of the ca used and the ca name, but, if your hostname or ca name have dots in them they are automatically changed to dashes, i dont know if this behavior is intended but i couldnt find anything about this in the documentation. Is it ok if i change the name of this cert to something else after it is created?  i think it would be better if this cert was generated automatically with another name, something set up before creation or anything more simple.  ></description> </Issue>

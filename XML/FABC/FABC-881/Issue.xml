CDATA Currently the vendor.json on fabric-ca has different commit levels for dependencies from same github repository (example:  https://github.ibm.com/hyperledger/fabric)      It is okay if the commit levels are coming from the same branch, but some of those come from different branch of the same repository. Example: Only two metrics dependencies come from master branch of fabric, whereas others are from release-1.4 branch.     Ref:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/release-1.4/vendor/vendor.json#L501-L586   ></description> </Issue>

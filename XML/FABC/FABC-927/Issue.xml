CDATA Hello,  Actually I don't know if I should post this issue under Fab-CA or Fab-SDK-Go.  When I enroll a user from Fab-SDK-Go it creates a key and a CSR. The key is stored in the user store. Its filename is given by the SKI. The key is created by BCCSP which uses SHA256 to compute the SKI.  When Fab-CA creates the certificate it uses cloudflare (github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/signer/signer.go). Cloudflare however uses SHA1 to compute the SKI that it adds to the certificate.  When I want to reuse an already enrolled identity, Fab-SDK-Go finds the certificate, reads its SKI and looks up the corresponding key in the user store. The SKI found in the certificate is a SHA1 digest, as it comes from Fab-CA, but the user store contains a key whose filename is a SHA256 digest, as it comes from Fab-SDK-Go.  Finally I've decided to post this issue under Fab-CA and not Fab-SDK-Go because the latter uses the same BCCSP code as Fabric itself. So I suppose that SHA256 (Fabric; Fab-SDK-Go) will stay and SHA1 (Fab-CA/cloudflare) should go.  ></description> </Issue>

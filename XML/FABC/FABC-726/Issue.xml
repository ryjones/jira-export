CDATA *Senario:* 3 Orgs in a network lets call it AdminOrg, OrgA and OrgB 3 Fabric CAs AdminOrgCA, OrgACA and OrgBCA. All these CAs are trusted by all Orgs in the network. 3 Fabric Channels "shared" (AdminOrg has Admin previledges), "channelA" (OrgA is admin) and "channelB" (OrgB is admin). All Orgs use Fabric channel "shared". OrgA decides to revoke User1 and is able to generate CRL and push this change to "channelA". OrgA would now have to manually share this CRL which AdminOrg so it can push an updated on "shared" channel that User1 is revoked hence doesn't have any access to this channel.  Adding getcrl endpoint with anonymous access would allow AdminOrg to do a periodic pull of CRLs of each Org and push update on "shared" channel.  I believe currently gencrl generates a new CRL when called. If the latest CRL is stored in DB then this could be returned when getcrl endpoint is queried.

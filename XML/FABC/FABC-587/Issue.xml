CDATA fabric-ca-server should support REST APIs for managing certificates. One of the most important ones will be to delete all expired certificates, or which expired more than some period of time ago.  This will prevent the certificate table from infinitely growing. Another is to query for certificates which are about to expire so the identities can be notified that they need to reenroll in order to renew their certificate.

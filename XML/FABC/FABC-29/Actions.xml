CDATA I'm not sure I understand the "root" of this requirement.  I think it would be better to actually define the API on the fabric-ca server rather than showing the fabric-ca-client syntax.  CA certs are supposed to be long-term .... I understand that one might need to eventually need to create a new root CA keypair .... but not sure why we necessarily need to have an API for this?  I guess the bigger question is why we need to add anything special for this?  If someone really wants to change / update the root signing pair, they can do so.  I tend to think having this as a manual process is more in line with the significance of actually making a change like this.  That being said, maybe we should actually have a config setting for fabric-ca server to allow rotation of the key pair at some  interval.  Of course we could also expose that function as an API.  I guess we'd need something similar when running as an intermediate CA as well.  ></body> </Action>

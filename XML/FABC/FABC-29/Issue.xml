CDATA The following is a first pass at the commands which would allow rolling over a CA signing key:  {code} 1) fabric-ca-client cacertificate create <name>  --parent-cacertficate <parentName>  Simply creates a new signing certificate and tags it with <name> but doesn't start using it, at least not by default.  We could provide a non-default option to sign with this new cacert also. 2) fabric-ca-client cacertificate list List all CA certificates and which one is currently being used to sign. 3) fabric-ca-client cacertificate setcur <name> Change the current certificate used to sign. 4) fabric-ca-client cacertificate delete <name> Delete a CA signing certificate.  Do not allow deleting the current one. {code} The name of the first CA cert is named "default" by default.  To rollover a CA cert: {code} 1) fabric-ca-client cacertificate create 2018 Using the year for the name.  This will return the new CA cert. 2) Push the new CA cert to the appropriate channel MSPs and local MSPs. 3) fabric-ca-client cacertificate setcur 2018 The CA will now start issuing certs with the new CA cert 4) fabric-ca-client cacertificate delete default This really isn't necessary and is probably better to leave for history purpose, but could be done if you want {code}  NOTE: If we need to rollover root and intermediate CA cert at the same time, the process would be as follows: {code} 1) fabric-ca-client cacertificate create 2018   // while logged into root CA 2) fabric-ca-client cacertificate create 2018 --parent-cacertificate 2018 //  While logged into intermediate CA. 3) Push the new root and intermediate CA cert to the appropriate channel MSPs and local MSPs. 4) fabric-ca-client cacertificate setcur 2018 // do this for both root and  intermediate CA 5) fabric-ca-client cacertificate delete default  // optionally do for both root and intermediate CA {code}  All of these commands would require a new `hf.CAAdmin=true' attribute.  ></description> </Issue>

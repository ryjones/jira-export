First, that's a great change/suggestion (to have this consistently aligned). As history has shown over an over, naming environment variables, repos and sub-directories has always been one of the hottest topics in the project! ;-)  Just quickly: I'm totally with you on CFG_HOME -> CFG_PATH suffix. My suggestion is to change from *CA_CFG_PATH* -> *FABRIC_CA_CFG_PATH*  While {color:red}FABRIC-CA{color}_CFG_PATH is more "correct" due to the capitalization of "fabric-ca", I believe it's very error prone... and does not feel right.  Let me quickly run it by the teams?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Instead of a single fabric-ca executable, we will soon have separate fabric-ca-server and fabric-ca-client executables and fabric-ca will go away. Although I'm not wild about long names to start with, I think there is some consistency in that the new env var prefixes will be FABRIC_CA_SERVER and FABRIC_CA_CLIENT, respectively.  That is, the prefix for "peer" is "PEER_", so the env var prefixes should be the same as the executable name, changing "-" to "_".  Anyway, the exec name to env var prefix seems consistent. If we changed the name of the executables to "ca-server" and "ca-client", then we could change the env variable prefix accordingly.   ></body> </Action>

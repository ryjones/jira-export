CDATA The readme files for fabric and fabric-ca include instructions for starting and configuring these entities, but no (fabric-ca) or minimal (fabric) instructions for how to reliably restart fabric-ca and fabric.  It is inconceivable to expect no one to need to restart these processes.   We need to make it clear to our users how to do so reliably.   One solution is to simply list the steps for cleaning up after the process is cancelled  in the readme files or other associated documentation.   Maybe that's the best approach for fabric.  For {{fabric-ca}},  we can do something more robust and user friendly.  Is now : {{fabric-ca server  init | start }} Could be  {{fabric-ca server  init | start | *clean* }} where *clean* tells fabric-ca to delete all artifacts from prior server invocations.  You'd follow that up with *fabric-ca server start *to get a fresh start. The advantage of doing it this way is that the artifacts remain after the server is cancelled, which may be useful for diagnostics.   Could be {{fabric-ca server  init | start | *stop* }} where *stop* tells the server to clean up all its artifacts instead of simply crashing and burning.  The idea is that the next start will be a clean start.   It would be easier to maintain the server *clean|stop* code than to keep the documentation synchronized.   If you want to bug->task this fix, the documentation should be updated immediately before putting this issue into the backlog.      ></description> </Issue>

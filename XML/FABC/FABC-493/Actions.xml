CDATA This is really a feature request.  The fabric-ca-server has an *init* and a *start* command, but no *stop* command or *restart* command. The start command runs in a foreground and currently assumes you would just use a shell to run it in the background.  One option would be to support a fabric-ca-server stop command which sends a stop request to its listening port as an identity with the "hf.fabric-ca-server.admin" attribute (or something similar). This would prevent just anyone from being able to send a stop request. The fabric-ca-server restart command would then do a stop and then start a new instance.  I believe go 1.8 will support a graceful shutdown so that we don't lose requests that are currently being processed.  ></body> </Action>

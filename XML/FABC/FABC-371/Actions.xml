CDATA Changing the focus of this defect. Ultimately, I think still requires both a code change and a doc change. The bottom-line is that I should have specified user:pass as part of the URL scheme.  1 -  The instructions for starting a registration authority (child CA) in the "Fabric CA User’s Guide" should also specify that the 'user' and 'passwd' are part of the URL for the -u option. Here is the current text:  "The fabric-ca-server init command generates a self-signed CA certificate unless the -u <parent-fabric-ca-server-URL> option is specified. If the -u is specified, the server’s CA certificate is signed by the parent fabric-ca-server. The fabric-ca-server init command also generates a default configuration file named fabric-ca-server-config.yaml in the server’s home directory."   2 - This URL scheme should be enforced. Currently the command proceeds w/o it, but is doomed to fail with an 'Authentication error'  ></body> </Action>

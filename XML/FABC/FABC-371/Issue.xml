CDATA I think this is really two issues, depending on whether or not I mis-understand how it's supposed to be configured.  At any rate the certificate that is created on behalf of a delegate/subordinate registration authority is created with the Basic Constrains extension flagged 'critical' and set to CA:FALSE. It should be CA:TRUE.  Secondly, I could not figure out how to populate the data for the CSR (the potential 2nd issue). It seems that it comes from an instantiation of the ServerConfig.Client.ClientConfig object, but I don't know where this data is coming from. In order to create the certificate, I coded the CSR data manually in getCACertAndKey(). The documentation should make this explicit.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Today, fabric-ca-server will fail register, revoke, and reenroll requests if the authorization header does not contain an actual certificate that was issued by the CA and that is stored in the CA's database.   This is overly restrictive and prevents us from supporting a scenario in which a user starts with cryptogen and then wants to transition to using fabric-ca-server. It should be sufficient to verify that the certificate was issued by the CA's signing certificate, and not require that the actual certificate is stored in the CA's database.   ></description> </Issue>

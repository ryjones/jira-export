CDATA Related issue: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-141  I think we need a certificate renewal function.  Recently, I experienced an expiration of tca.cert, which caused failures in generating TCert batches. I manually installed tca.cert, tca.pub, tca.priv to membersrvc, and tca.cert to non-validating peers (clients), and validating peers. There are many certificates, such as eca.cert, tca.cert, aca.cert, tlsca.cert, ecerts, etc. Doing the above process for all the certificates manually is error-prone. It could be helpful to automate this process.  In addition to this, it will be helpful if one can configure the default valid period of a certificate. Currently, the valid period is fixed to 90 days, as far as I know.   ></description> </Issue>

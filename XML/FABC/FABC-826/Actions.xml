Generally speaking, people should either be able to enroll once or an infinite number of times.  Not sure why anyone would pick an arbitrary number of enrollments so not sure we actually need this." created="2019-08-25 23:07:38.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2019-08-25 23:07:38.0"/>

Since Fabric provides functionality to select number of enrollments we expose it through the UI the same way...  currently it is mainly for information purposes and troubleshooting to see if the given id has any enrollments left. " created="2019-08-26 13:21:47.0" updateauthor="varadatibm" updated="2019-08-26 13:21:47.0"/>

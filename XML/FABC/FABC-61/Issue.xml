CDATA *Server* Currently the ServerTLSConfig does not have an option for mutual TLS (client TLS authentication). The configuration needs to be extended to support different various client authentication by incorporation the different TLS client authentication types the TLS go package provides.   https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#ClientAuthType  type ClientAuthType int const ( NoClientCert ClientAuthType = iota RequestClientCert RequireAnyClientCert VerifyClientCertIfGiven RequireAndVerifyClientCert )  *Client* On client side need to remove enabled option from client TLS configuration. Whether TLS is enabled on client side will depend on the protocol of the URL that is provided for connecting to server. Using "https" will enable TLS, "http" will disable TLS.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Here is what I am seeing in the published API definition file for v1.4.0-rc2 release.  So the fabric-ca-server API wants to start the lifecycle of an identity from its own end and does not want to take the inputs of valid identity from another tool  such as cryptogen . If we can permit this new API call – where the caller passes in an identity – say created by cryptogen and if ca server can validate it and populate it in its SQLite data/object store – perhaps this would ease the pain and reduce the friction?  For more details - please see attached documents.   This issue is a friction point at multiple customer PoCs that we are aware of and it is getting more scrutiny as more customers are getting aware of this issue.   Thanks.   ></description> </Issue>

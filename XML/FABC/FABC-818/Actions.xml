CDATA Dear Gari,   >>> so I'm not sure this is a scenario we want to / should support.            Me neither!  However I can tell you - cryptogen is being used not just to play with and use in dev/test/pre-prod environments.           I also know - bringing up fabric-ca with key pairs generated by cryptogen is one part of solution. What is needed is - an ability to transition all the consortium members be recognized by fabric-ca *seamlessly* - that cryptogen initially bootstrapped since this is what enables customers to use the bootstrapped and running identities to be continued on as the cryptogen to fabric-ca hand off takes place.  Are you aware of such a capability?  This is the context of this feature request. If this capability is not provided - there is a risk of customers going into operational environment with cryptogen identities  *unsupported * if ** this is not already happening. This would lead to more downstream issues, potentially.  Please share your wisdom.  ></body> </Action>

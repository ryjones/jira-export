CDATA Currently there are two places you can specify 'hosts' when performing an enrollment. One place is to specify it as part of the CSR API and the second place is in the Enrollment Request API. For example, you can see duplicate hosts flags:  --csr.*hosts* stringSlice        A list of space-separated host names in a certificate signing request --csr.serialnumber string      The serial number in a certificate signing request, which becomes part of the DN (Distinquished Name) -d, --debug                        Enable debug level logging --enrollment.*hosts* string      Comma-separated host list  It is unclear to a user as to which one to use or which one will take precedence. Currently the hosts that is part of the Enrollment API will only take affect and the host from the CSR API will get ignored. Need to only have one place to specify hosts and it should be part of the CSR API.   *Reproduction:* 1. Enroll user: fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 --csr.hosts host1 --enrollment.hosts host2 2. Examine ecert and will only see host2 and not host1  ></description> </Issue>

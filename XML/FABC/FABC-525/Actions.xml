CDATA Was wondering if this change in the MSP logic suffices for us to define a different MSP that identifies admins in this way(?)   It seems a bit strange to me that we would have two ways of identifying the same role in the same MSP. If we decide to go this way, shall we have a flag that is set or unset to indicate the mode in which admins are identified in a certain MSP instance? Though this would complicate the configuration of that MSP slightly more, we can have the default value of the flag be indicating the current operation. What do you think?  Also keep in mind that with this new way of defining admins, changing an admin would require blacklisting its certificate.   Would you consider this story for alpha2, v1.0, v1.1?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I think half is this is tied up in the ability to update a peer's local MSP without restarting.  If this were possible, I think many of the usability issues go away.  That being said, I've also long thought it would be a fairly simple thing to do, to designate some particular channel to be an 'MSP source' for a peer.  Essentially, if this channel says the user is an admin, then treat that user as an admin.  But specifically, I wouldn't consider this tied to lifecycle, and a more general approach is needed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I agree that updating a peer's local MSP is needed for other reasons, but I don't think it is needed to solve this particular problem. This can be solved in an easier way by removing the need for a config update. My proposal in the description works only with fabric-ca because it relies on custom attributes; however, you could use an OU path or any of the standard X509 fields to support other CAs. No matter which field is used to identify an admin identity, there must be appropriate governance around the issuance of certs with that field. For example, if the flag to identify admin was OU=admin, the CA must issue certs with OU=admin to only the appropriate identities who are intended to be admins.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="56276" issue="16503" author="jyellick" type="comment" body=" ~smithbk  Agreed, it would be great to be able to define admins by OU, instead of explicitly listing them, and perhaps that would satisfy this issue by itself.  Still, I think there is the broader issue that managing the local MSPs is painful, and the requirement to specifically enumerate the admin certs makes the pain more obvious." created="2019-01-28 17:35:39.0" updateauthor="jyellick" updated="2019-01-28 17:35:39.0"/>

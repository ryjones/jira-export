CDATA Can be approached two different ways. One approach is to have multiple tca.cert.chain files coming from multiple different membership service instances. These were placed in the peer's filesystem, from there the code was modified to be able to read multiple chain files and then append their respective certificates to the certpool. The transaction certificate is then compared against the certpool which now contains cert from multiple membership services and will pass verification.  Second approach is to have one chain file with multiple certificates inside (a certificate from each membership service instance). Then to parse the chain file to separate out the certificates and append them in the certpool. Both approaches work, so we can do down either path.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This bug is definitely real - it just depends on how far we want to go in terms of fixing it in the near term versus a longer term fix. A quick fix is to  modify https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/lib/tls/tls.go#L47 by removing the skip tag.  This will make it possible for this command to work with TLS but will not support config files nor environment variables  - just command line options  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The main issue is that there in no way to enable TLS for the getcacert command. The way TLS is enabled is by looking at the URL the client provides, if the client uses https as the protocol then TLS gets enabled. This logic is executed in a function called configInit(), all other commands call into this function however getcacert command does not. Besides just enabling TLS, configInit() also contains the necessary viper logic to enable reading configuration settings from the a config file or environment variables. Calling configInit() for the getcacert is the ideal fix to this issue.  However, there is a simpler fix of just enabling TLS for getcacert by exposing a CLI flag (currently hidden) that will allow user to enable TLS be setting this flag. However, this introduces a difference in behavior when compared to other commands that don't require setting this flag to enable TLS. Also, no support for config file or environment variable would exist for getcacert.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is a follow-up to FAB-5305.  Looking at the problem more broadly it has become apparent that we need to be more careful about not leaving CA databases open all over the place. On Windows this translates in files remaining locked, which prevents the deletion of those files, after which all sorts of errors occur as a consequence. While unit-tests exacerbate the problem by repeatedly creating databases, doing some test, and deleting them, which is probably not frequently done in a normally running system this still exhibits a problem that ought to be addressed.  To fix this problem, we need to: # check that os.RemoveAll doesn't return any error and act on them if there is any # consistently close any open CA database when done  Â   ></description> </Issue>

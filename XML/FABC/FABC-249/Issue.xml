CDATA fabric-ca 64 encodes and decodes w/o padding, but the standard is to use padding. So we need to change fabric-ca to encode with padding and handle decoding both with and w/o padding.  This problem became apparent when coding the register command for the java SDK.  The standard base 64 encoding was not recognized in the authorization header, so the request failed.  ></description> </Issue>

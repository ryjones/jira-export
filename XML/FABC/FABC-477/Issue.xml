CDATA If an intermediate CA tries to specify a CN in the CSR section during enrollment with the root CA an error is thrown and the enrollment fails.  An error is not necessary and would improve usability if the following is done. If the CN is populated in the CSR, the CN should get replaced with the Enrollment ID and a warning should be thrown to indicate that such a replacement took place.  ></description> </Issue>

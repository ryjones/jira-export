CDATA In concrete terms, ensure the generated metrics reflect what's currently in the code.  For the "api_name" label, provide a list of possible values and their meanings. Ideally this becomes a metadata field or annotation on the struct.  Then, based on the extension, gendoc should be updated _or_ a solution specific to ca should be used to include the api names and descriptions into the documentation.  Acceptance: documentation can be generated by running a script. The generated doc should include api name values and descriptions in a human readable form.  ></body> </Action>

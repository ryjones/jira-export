CDATA There's been a difference of interpretation regarding the display of DNs.  Notwithstanding the dispute, this is actually good timing since I've been investigating the go1.10 release documentation including updates to crypto/x509/pkix. It now implements a String() method that formats the X.509 distinguished name in the standard RFC 2253 format. The fact still remains that the RDNs displayed are limited to those returned by toRDNSequence(), which apparently by design *only include the common elements* of a DN. While all elements stored in Names (including those which are non-standard) *are available* in the pkix.Name object, and  *can* be extracted from there, we chose not to. So it makes sense to exploit the pkix package-provided  h3. func (Name)  String|https://golang.org/src/crypto/x509/pkix/pkix.go?s=6060:6089#L216   method for simplicity and consistency. I've updated the CR accordingly.  ></body> </Action>

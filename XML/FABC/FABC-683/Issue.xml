CDATA The *run_ldap_tests* script contained in the fabric-cop codebase uses an x86-based Docker image: osixia/openldap.  The LDAP tests fail on both z and p platforms due to the use of this x86-based Docker image.  The script could be changed to select the appropriate LDAP Docker image based on the detected architecture.  If there are currently no LDAP Docker images for z and p on Docker Hub, perhaps the images can be built upon the hyperledger/fabric-baseimage.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24 , I have not taken a look out on Docker Hub to see if there are openldap distributions for Linux on z or p.  There have been an increasing number of fabric and fabric-cop unit tests that require external Docker images.    In addition to openldap for fabric-cop, Kafka and Zookeeper are required for the Kafka Orderer unit tests and these tests use x86_64 Docker images as well.  I have opened up issue,  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1413 , regarding the use of x86_64 Docker images for the Kafka Orderer tests.  Just recently, a change,  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/3161/ , was submitted that proposed using x86_64 Docker images for Postgres and haproxy.  I wonder if it would make sense to come up with a plan to implement our own set of Docker images for all three platforms, if there are no publicly available OpenLDAP, Kafka, Zookeeper, Postgres and Haproxy Docker images for z and p.  ></body> </Action>

<Issue id="29331" key="FABC-428" number="428" project="10607" reporter="toddinpal" creator="toddinpal" type="10001" summary="Accept OAuth or other token in fabric-ca enrollment request" description="In anÂ enterprise environment, fabric SDK or fabric application would not have access to user credentials. The User would authenticate against Identity Provider or Authentication Provider and will pass some form of token to the fabric SDK application. The SDK application can pass through the token down to fabric-ca and fabric-ca should be able to authenticate the user based on the token and enroll the user. We should support OAuth tokens at a minimum, although ideally the API change would support any form of token and leave it to the fabric-ca plug-in to deal with it." priority="2" status="10000" created="2018-04-11 17:44:51.0" updated="2019-08-25 23:04:40.0" votes="3" watches="8" workflowId="32610"/>

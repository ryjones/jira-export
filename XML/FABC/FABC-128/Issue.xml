CDATA Currently, attribute a=b is stored as  \{"name": "a","value":"b"} , which is lot of characters to just store a=b. This needs to be optimized.     Also, affiliations table can be optimized as well. Currently, prekey field is not being used. We should think about removing it  , if it is not going to be used in the future.  ></description> </Issue>

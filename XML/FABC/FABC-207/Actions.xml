CDATA This is not really a bug, it is just how Postgres chooses to display binary data. We derive the certificates table schema from CFSSL and we can't really change the schema, otherwise, we risk being incompatible with CFSSL. Both Serial and AKI are stored as hex. The right way to retrieve column data in hex format is to do a SQL query rather than just inspecting the table directly.   For example, you can query the Serial number in hex format with:  SELECT convert_from(serial_number, 'SQL_ASCII') FROM certificates;  I am marking this as Done, please open back up if you don't agree.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Seen with versions 1.3 and 1.4. Using Postgres as the DB for fabric-ca-server.  When a fabric-ca-client later tries to enroll, it receives the following error message: {{Error Code: 0 - 2 rows were affected when updating the state of identity <username>}}  This can be confirmed by using psql to check the user's table.  One possible reason why this may be happening is due to the users table not having a PRIMARY KEY set, or at least not having UNIQUE set on the id column:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/8c5bc3566495a3aaf566bf90d3f9da631ec46869/lib/dbutil/util.go#L295 Â   fabric-ca-server (debug) logs are attached.  ></description> </Issue>

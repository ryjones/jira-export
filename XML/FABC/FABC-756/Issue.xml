CDATA I've modified the fabric-ca example in v1.2 fabric-samples to have one common RCA and an ICA for each org. So, in that example there are 3 orgs and hence there were 3 RCAs which I changed it to one RCA and then there are 3 ICAs for each org.     When the setup is creating channel, there is an error in run container log saying failed to connect to orderer due to authentication handshake failed and tls bad certificate.  Error on orderer log is, tls: failed to verify client's certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509: ECDSA verification failure" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "rca-mainorg-admin"     ></description> </Issue>

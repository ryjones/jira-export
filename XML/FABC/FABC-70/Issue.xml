CDATA Currently, fabric save ECDSA key to file with begin line like ` {code:java} -----BEGIN ECDSA PRIVATE KEY----- {code} `. Though the RF5919 don't make begin line standardized, openssl forced ECDSA key file begin with ` {code:java} -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- {code} `, and x509 package of golang examples use ` {code:java} -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- {code} `, too. So it's better to keep fabric being compatible with openssl.   ></description> </Issue>

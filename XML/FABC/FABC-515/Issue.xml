CDATA The FabricCA should provide both a means for finding it's current version and possibly what capabilities it has.  I suggested augmented {color:#444444}cainfo{color} endpoint as I think it's been there since 1.0 so it can be distinguished between api failure and endpoint not there.  If cainfo does not have a version or possibly capabilities  it's just assumed 1.0 level.        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Whether this optional parameter is useful is debatable.  Either way, it's intended use is unclear, since the sample does not include it, nor does the help text adequately describe it's use. I'm not advocating either way for the elimination, nor retention of this field; if we keep it, it needs to honor the syntax rules defined by the OID, and is well-documented.  The expected use of the Serial Number attribute type defined by the LDAP schema (2.5.4.5 - id-at-serialNumber) would used as a qualifier RDN of the certificate subject, e.g. CN=admin,serialNumber=<number>, ...  The cfssl implementation violates the syntax of the the ASN.1 definition, since the printable string's 'ub-serial-number' restricts the length from 1-64. cfssl apparently has no upper limit for this field as I was able to stuff well over 8K chars into the cert.  This is apparently raises a separate issue since we should restrict the DN's length to a reasonable value. I'll open a separate defect for that.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~gsqtds  The expiration of a certificate is not related to the "Not Before" of a the issue CA certificate. The certification expiration is just checked against the current time to see that it falls between the NotBefore and NotAfter value of the certificate. Do you have the full set of logs with debug enabled from when the error occurred? Maybe the certification validation is failing due to incorrectly configured MSP?  Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~skarim  I am developing baas platform based on fabric. Because the crypto configuration file is generated, it contains the root CA certificate and takes a very short time to register with the user. So if both the crypto configuration file and the registered user are within the first 30 seconds of the same minute, then the user registration time is less than the root certificate generation time. This is because not before uses the round function.  NotBefore = time.Now ().Round (time.Minute).Add (backdate)  For this problematic network, I tried to make it work well if another new user was registered at a later time.  ></body> </Action>

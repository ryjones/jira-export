CDATA Just to clarify (yesterday I have approved the CR from my mobile), this +{color:#ff0000}needed{color}+ fixing not just because PKCS#8 is less confusing... we could not have used PKCS#1 (which was made for RSA keys), for EC. See:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9121/1/images/fabric-ca/payload/ca-key.pem   While reading and parsing the PKCS#8 is a bit slower (not that the bottleneck here is reading the private key) - it is the correct way in this case.  As I wrote before approving, I hope this is well tested... otherwise we should add tests for this.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~JonathanLevi   Sure, the key was usedÂ in the e2e test cases, also the sdk-py project.  So if we do not break existing ones, then it will be fine.  We will add more test cases in the sdk-py project, too.  ></body> </Action>

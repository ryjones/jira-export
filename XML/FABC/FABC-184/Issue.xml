CDATA Need to make sure that backwards compatibility is maintained for identities, if any new attributes are added that affect current functionality. An example of this is the newly introduced 'hf.Registrar.Attributes' attribute that defines what attributes a registrar is allowed to register for a new identity. If the registrar does not have this attribute they will not be allowed to register an identity that is requesting attributes. Currently, registrar identities won't possess this newly added 'hf.Registrar.Attribute' attribute and will start to break when they try to register new identities.  *Proposal:*  Introduce versions on both the server configuration file and the database. During server startup, the version of the configuration file and database will be examined. If an older version is being used, actions will be taken on the identities to add any newly introduced attributes as appropriate. After a successful update, the version of the configuration file and database will be updated to the current version.   ></description> </Issue>

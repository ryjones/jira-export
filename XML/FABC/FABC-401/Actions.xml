CDATA Why not just copy the official busybox images?  I'd say just use them but we do build on multiple platforms so probably better to copy them.  I'd suggest https://github.com/docker-library/busybox/blob/master/uclibc/Dockerfile.builder   - which uses ulibc and does not require any of the libnss* stuff used by glibc.    There is also a nice glibc version as well if we are inclined to stay on that path  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Pasted from slack;  The problem is build environment neutral.  We compile both busybox and the golang code in our baseimage container.  The glibc in question is therefore picked up in our Debian/Ubuntu ecosystem.  I explain the rationale for not using the official busybox here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/b61723f9ddcc91cafd4f3a8c3634bd8d32388b32  One complication here is the multiarch stuff as you noted.  Another is that it's not only busybox that is broken:  Our golang apps pick up the bad dns functions too  There are numerous ways to solve this but most of them are probably untenable from either a support and/or licensing perspective.  I think I have a workable solution being tested right now though.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Change type of IsAdmin attribute sent in the idemix/credential response to bool and change swagger doc accordingly.  IsAdmin is an attribute given to all users requesting Idemix credential. The response to the idemix/credential request contains a map of attribute name and value. Currently, all values are converted to strings and sent as strings in the map. With this change map is changed to accept any type of value. So, a boolean value will be stored in the map for the IsAdmin attribute.  ></description> </Issue>

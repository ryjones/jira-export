CDATA We are running into issue with Fabric CA where we have multiple Intermediate CAs running with common ROOT CA and the user cert issued by Intermediate CA1 is not trusted by Intermediate CA2 even though both CAs are sharing the same DB.  Attached diagram for better explanation.  Current work around is to add Intermediate CA certs to ca chain file so that both CAs trust Root, itself and each the other CA.  ></description> </Issue>

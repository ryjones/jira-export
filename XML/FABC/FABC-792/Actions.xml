CDATA This is not a "bug" ... might be a feature request although I'm not sure we actually want to do anything about this. It's pretty hairy to get into trying to automate cert distribution across multiple intermediates.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Not a problem, but please update the documentation, because this means that getting load balanced between multiple intermediate instances is not possible anymore, especially not with round robin as the documentation suggests.   https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/users-guide.html#overview    https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/users-guide.html#setting-up-a-cluster         ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mastersingh24 ,  I agree with  ~silveraid 's comment here. If there's no plan to support this and mentioned that this is expected behaviour for PKIX the documentation should be updated.  Also, if you think this is be a feature request, I can open a Jira for it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Let me clarify.  Fabric CA will not copy certs across intermediates to enable HA.  However, this can be done manually outside of Fabric.   ~ahmedsajid   ~silveraid   ></body> </Action>
<Action id="61956" issue="36833" author="mastersingh24" type="comment" body="I also believe that load balancing across a cluster of CA&apos;s is orthogonal; unless I&apos;m reading the docs wrong, it does not say that your cluster had to be made up of multiple intermediate CAs.  Nothing prevents you from sharing the same intermediate root pair across multiple Fabric CA servers." created="2019-07-18 16:16:31.0" updateauthor="mastersingh24" updated="2019-07-18 16:16:31.0"/>

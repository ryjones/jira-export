CDATA 1. For starters, the feature/ca branch is broken and all the below submitted changesets cannot build.  * Add README, Makefile, test cases, fixes ...		Keith Smith * Defining Enroll Request in API and CLI.		Saad Karim * TCERT Library Partial implementation		Ashutosh Kumar * FAB-836/809 revisited: CreateToken and VerifyToken		Pho Le * Fix changeset 1971 - DB Bootstrapping & Register		Saad Karim			 * Partial work for supporting the register command		Keith Smith * Database API Implementation		Saad Karim * Bootstrap DB and update DB when registering user		Saad Karim * Moved DB API Implementation into COP code		Saad Karim  2. Tracing back we spotted two commits (from Oct 12, and the latest fix, from Oct 18): https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/gitweb?p=fabric.git;a=commit;h=64f7111eedf6838ad0b4fe534b9aab2230ee180b which may have broken it.  3. The break happens early on at the `vagrant up` stage (which triggers a make call that fails with):  default: update-java-alternatives: plugin alternative does not exist: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/IcedTeaPlugin.so *`==> default: Makefile:145: *** multiple target patterns.  Stop.`*  4. We are considering options - either to strip down the build process of the feature/ca branch, or to simply merge the latest version of master (which also upgrades to Ubuntu 16.04, etc.)  Noting that at the time of writing this, feature/ca is *554 commits behind* the master branch (which builds!)   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA User attributes can be selectively included in TCerts and this is the primary means to implement access control from within chaincodes. Right now while a registrar can dynamically register new users via API calls, this is not possible with user attributes managed by ACA.  Would be a high priority feature for deployments that don't have easy access to the backend peer processes (in docker or VMs), like those apps working with the a blockchain service deployed to a PaaS cloud platform. They rely on using the application to dynamically register users and add user attributes.  ></description> </Issue>

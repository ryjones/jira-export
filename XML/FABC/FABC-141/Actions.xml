CDATA Hyperledger Fabric does not provide binaries as we would need to do so for many platforms. This is easy to build if you want to run natively and we are now publishing more docker images with fabric-ca-client. This is our current plan.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~smithbk  I discussed this with  ~mastersingh24  before raising it, adding a bit more reasoning behind this request:  Composer users are coming to the Composer team and asking for a command line utility for performing Fabric operational tasks like enrolling IDs, registering new IDs, etc outside of a Composer business network. These are tasks that do not actually have anything to do with Composer.  We really don't want get into the situation where we end up building a duplicate of the existing Fabric CA client. Is publishing binaries really that hard, given that Fabric are already publishing binaries of the other CLI applications?  ></body> </Action>

<Action id="40552" issue="22483" author="aambati" type="comment" body=" ~weeds  Hi Sharon, Fabric CA uses couple of libraries that use C code. This is complicating cross compiling Fabric CA client on Linux (which is the OS used in our builds) to create binaries for different architectures and operating systems. For 1.1 Simon wants binaries for Linux and Mac. So far I have not been able to build Mac binaries on Linux. I have tried multiple tools, with out any success.  I am continuing my investigation. Hopefully will have a solution soon." created="2018-02-22 03:44:29.0" updateauthor="aambati" updated="2018-02-22 03:44:29.0"/>

CDATA The actual bug here might be that we allow extraneous command line flags for the init command. Most of the command line options are designed to override the config file ... not actually set value in the config file.  That's not to say that we can't do that, but that was not the actual intent of most of the flags.  I'd vote to defer this to either 2.0 or perhaps a 1.4.x path release at this point  ></body> </Action>

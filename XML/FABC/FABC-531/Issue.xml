CDATA The fabric-ca-server should support a stop command.  Perhaps it should only be invoked locally and not be supported remotely.  See the "peer node stop" command. See https://gist.github.com/peterhellberg/38117e546c217960747aacf689af3dc2 for graceful shutdown of HTTP endpoint. And also a fabric-ca-server status command to tell if the server is up or down.   ></description> </Issue>

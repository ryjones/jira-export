CDATA had a discussion with  ~ashku , this is the problem with the certificate: {code} X509v3 extensions: X509v3 Key Usage: critical Certificate Sign X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical CA:FALSE {code}  If the key usage is "Certificate Sign" then the next field must be "CA:TRUE". Or the key usage should have been "Digital Signature".  Essentially Java is pointing out a legitimate problem with the certificate. Please have the developer double check on the certificate and how it got generated.  ></body> </Action>

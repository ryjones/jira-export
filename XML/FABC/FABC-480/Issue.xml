CDATA When Fabric-CA is started for first time it fills affiliation table from provided config file, but all affiliation names are converted to lowercase. For example CompanyACME will be stored in database as companyacme.   When new registration request is send then the check for proper affiliation is case sensitive, so if user provide CompanyACME registration will fail because no such affiliation will be found.  When affiliation is added using: {code:java} fabric-ca-client affiliation add {code} case is preserved.  This is inconvenient in many cases, especially when there is some integration and automation.  Make this behavior consistent, for example in all places search and match are case insensitive, or preserve case no mater from where affiliation is added.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~maripo5  , you need to think in terms of how you can construct LDAP filter to get required attribute . So , what is your end goal ? You want users only from certain OU to be able to execute chaincode ? If that the case , the easiest thing to do , is to have your search DN constructed in such a way that an only Objectclass in the DIT corresponding to your OU will be interrogated. Will this work for you ?  Alternatively , you can control it via Group and Role LDAP construct.     Let me know which approach will work for you and then I'll move to next steps.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~skarim ,  ~ashutosh_kumar , could you please explain, why it is working as expected ?  I totally agree that i can make workaruond for that and it will works but the issue is about finding attributes if they occur multiple times in DN. If attribute occurs only once, then attr function return correct value, if multiple times, then nothing is returned. I am afraid that it's not very unlikely case while working with LDAP  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~maripo5  , LDAP attributes do not occur in DN , it is contained in LDAP object. So , you use your DN for narrow down the LDAP object that you are after. That DN is based DN of your search. If you do not have enough information to narrow down your search , your base DN becomes Root DN of your tree.  LDAP client implementation of Fabric CA merely searches for the object found in Base DN and return you the value for that attribute. In your LDAP search , entries appearing in Base DN is not being returned as search response and hence Fabric CA LDAP client cannot do anything about it.  Let me know , if you have more question(s).     ></body> </Action>

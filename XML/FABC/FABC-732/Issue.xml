CDATA {color:#172b4d}That issue was initially discussed with Kumar Ashutosh on hyperledger chat and i am opening Jira for that to more clarify the issue{color}  LDAP structure:  !image-2018-10-09-23-14-43-020.png!  Let's say that the requirement is to execute chaincode by users in _ou=dev_  To make it possible: # i defined custom attribute; _executeChaincode_ # check in chaincode if _executeChaincode_ evaluate to true # implement converters in _fabric-ca-server-config.yaml_ file:  {code:java}       names:  'ou', 'cn'  converters: - name: executeChaincode value: attr("ou") =~ ".*dev.*" {code} 4. Enrolled user and pass _executeChaincode_ as enrollment attribute  The issue in my opinion is in _attr_ function defined in server config file  My assumption here was that _attr("ou")_ will return string that will consist of all _ou_ attributes, so for dev1 sth like  *"dev,engineering,Groups"* but it returned empty String.  However _attr("cn")_ will return _"dev1"_ string.  So the issue is that in case of attributes which occur more than once in _DN_, _attr_ function doesn't return anything, but for these which occur only once it works fine.  ></description> </Issue>

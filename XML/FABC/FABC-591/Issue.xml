CDATA Story: Participants of a network must have the ability to apply, or have applied, patches to their node, so that they can take advantage of new features and function, gain new performance improvements, avoid serious stability issues and patches for bugs and possible vulnerabilities on her node.    Description: Needs to be an understand of the details of the fix and possible impacts before making a change. Fix application ultimately needs to be done in a manner that doesn't require taking down the entire network or incurring other serious outages. Also needs to understand the network compatibility strategy. She needs to be able to go to the latest and greatest level of code to use the latest and greatest features, but must have a migration path.   Fabric upgrade  This is to track the phases of applying fixes to fabric components.  Phase 1 - Take node down and replace. Simple bug fixes  Phase 2 - Changes that create protocol compatibility issues. Require migration path   **Other considerations: Can this be done by simply replace a single node, allowing for new transactions to be queued up?  Need a strategy for rolling migrations through the network. Backward compatibility   ></description> </Issue>

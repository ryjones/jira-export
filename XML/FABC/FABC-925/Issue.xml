CDATA When running the asset-transfer-basic example from fabric-samples 2.2.1 with fabric-ca, the user 'appUser' receives a certificate with the following Subject DN:  {{ Subject: OU = client + OU = org1 + OU = department1, CN = appUser}}  This subject uses a multivalued RDN for the organizational units, so there is no order between the three OU entries (as RDNs are specified as SETs of attribute-type and value pairs).  I would have expected the Subject to be a sequence of RDNs:  {{ Subject: OU = client, OU = org1, OU = department1, CN = appUser}}  Looking at the tests in fabric-ca/lib/server_test.go, this seems to be the intention, but "crypto/x509" produces multi-valued OU-entries.        ></description> </Issue>

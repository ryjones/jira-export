CDATA The attached document explains why this deployment topology should be recommended for the setting up of a Hyperledger Blockchain Permissioned Network that features Fabric CA custom root CA  can be equally used with Fabric CA working with an external BYOCA well known, commercial and public CAs or entirely with an external well known commercial and public CAs – that the proposer of this feature is unaware of at this time .  With few modifications to the existing docker compose file and some testing – the following topology could be realized with hopefully minimal incremental effort.  Alternatively – this following topology could be documented and published – with existing content left alone and adding a comment that the topology shown is optimized and notional to explain the concept.   https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operations_guide.html   ></description> </Issue>

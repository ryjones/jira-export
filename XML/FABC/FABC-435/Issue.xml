CDATA During migration from 1.0.4 to 1.1:  ------------------------------------------- # Start 1.0.4 fabric_ca_server & fabric_ca_client # Load users from configuration file. # Stop 1.0.4 fabric_ca_server & fabric_ca_client # Now user can choose to modify(update, remove) or add a new user in configuration file before migrating to 1.1 fabric_ca_server and 1.1 fabric_ca_client.      5.   Output/Result for step4 above:      When a new user is added, this user gets added to DB.      Where as modifications have no impact on CA database.     since the behavior is not as expected during modify it would be nice to document for customers what to expect during a modification and addition of user details via a configuration file (before migration of fabric_ca_servers).          ></description> </Issue>

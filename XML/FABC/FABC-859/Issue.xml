<Issue id="41456" key="FABC-859" number="859" project="10607" reporter="jtonline" creator="jtonline" type="10004" summary="Attribute-Based Access Control uses incorrect OID" priority="3" status="10300" created="2019-07-26 15:44:52.0" updated="2020-04-27 14:05:06.0" votes="0" watches="6" workflowId="54473"> <description><! CDATA It looks like Fabric Attribute-Based Access Control is using an OID of 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.1 which is under \{iso(1) member-body(2)} and not registered as far as I can tell.  I don't know if the Linux Foundation already has a registered OID somewhere which Fabric x509 certificate attributes could fit under, or whether there's some other suitable OID we could register ABAC under. For comparison Puppet allow extensions under 1.3.6.1.4.1.34380  The earliest occurrence of 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.1 I could find is  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/b2941b5dd1cf8b6a089dc43130026cfb19a78f0b#diff-91bca7b9a8040e0c1f7aea0208c866a9R41  although it's not clear why the OID was chosen.  (As an aside, I've not found anything convincing one way or another but it seems like Subject Directory Attributes might be an alternative option to registering a new OID. That could be a read herring though so feel free to ignore!)  ></description> </Issue>

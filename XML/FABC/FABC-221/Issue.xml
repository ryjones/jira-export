CDATA If Alice wants to revoke Bob, Alice needs to be a fabric-ca revoker. This is implemented in the following way: Fabric-ca associates to certificates' common names a set of attributes. Then, if an identity has attribute hf.Revoker set to true, then that identity can revoke other identities.  The mechanism described above is subject to a privileges escalation attack. In a nutshell, Alice can spoof the common name of a fabric-ca revoker and asks the fabric-ca to issue a certificate for her with that common name. Alice can then use that certificate to revoke Bob and more.  The issue comes from the fact that attributes are bound to common names instead of certificates. In addition, a malicious client can force fabric-ca to generate a certificate for any common-name it wants despite the fabric-ca API.   ></description> </Issue>

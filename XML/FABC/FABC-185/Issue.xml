CDATA Working in the fabric-samples repository I can see the the fabric-ca the following example:  /master/fabric-ca/scripts/run-fabric.sh # Revoke the user and generate CRL using admin's credentials revokeFabricUser| generateCRL  With fabric-ca 1.1 we can combine the underlying calls (fabric-ca-client revoke and fabric-ca-client fabric-ca-client gencrl) into one where we do the revoke and generate crl.  I think it would be good to show both in the underlying env.sh script, maybe even one of them as a comment.  The reason is as I went through it I thought, 'wow I wish the revoke generated the crl'.  Allen then told me it does in 1.1.  On the other hand, it is great to see samples of both calls in env.sh.  Let me know and we can talk about it.  Thanks,  Barry  ></description> </Issue>

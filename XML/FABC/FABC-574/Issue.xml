CDATA While I try to enroll the user, there is no such problem. But, during register, there is an error of Segmentation Violation. I had a look into the code and found that some variable had been misplaced in the cli/client/util.go file.  I'm new to JIRA and don't know how to push new changes to the project. Please help me through it.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The main for cop is currently in the fabric-cop/cli package, so when you invoke `go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric-cop/cli` the name of the executable is `cli` by default. The COP main should be in a package named 'cop' so that the executable is named 'cop' by default. I am going to move the main to the fabric-cop/cop package, so you must use `go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric-cop/cop` instead of `go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric-cop/cli` to install the COP executable.  ></description> </Issue>

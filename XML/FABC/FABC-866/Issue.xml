CDATA As a blockchain developer and maintainer, I would like to have an automated process for handling certificate renewals. As my network grows with multiple nodes there is an increase in maintainability.  With this in place, nodes would reach out to a CA before their certificates are about to expire  The  ACME protocol|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment  was developed for _Let's Encrypt_ and has gained traction beyond just this service. There is a Go ACME client providing this functionality -  CertMagic|https://github.com/mholt/certmagic . Similarly, there is a CA written in Go supporting the ACME Protocol -  Boulder|https://www.github.com/letsencrypt/boulder .  The ACME Protocol was mentioned/proposed in FABC-697 but as far as I can see not implemented.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I think we partially do ourselves a disservice in Fabric by using the Fabric CA to issue TLS certificates.Â  I think it's nice that we can do it, but I think most people in production scenarios will have their own preferred method for obtaining TLS certificates.  For the Fabric nodes (peer, orderer), we intentionally do not bake in any mechanisms for obtaining crypto material; we simply let you point to existing material which one can obtain however they like.  ></body> </Action>

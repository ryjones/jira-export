CDATA The GetID function currently returns: {code} base64 encoding of "x509::<subjectDN>::<issuerDN>" {code} However, it is possible for a rogue MSP to create both a subjectDN and issuerDN to match that of an identity from another MSP.  In order to prevent this, the GetID function will be changed to return: {code} based 64 encoding of "<MSPID>::<subjectDN>" {code} The <subjectDN> is unique within an MSP and the MSPID makes it unique across MSPs. Since the MSPID is part of the serialized identity and is used to verify signature, it is impossible for a rogue MSP to forge an ID which matches an ID of an identity in another MSP. Also, use of the MSPID means we do not need to include the issuer's DN.  ></description> </Issue>

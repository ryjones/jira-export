CDATA Hi Fabric experts:  From the Fabric CA's documentation, I know that Fabric CA can use either PostgreSQL or MySQL to store identities and certificates. All Hyperledger Fabric CA servers in a cluster share the same database for keeping track of identities and certificates.  But the documentation does not say which one is preferred or recommended.  Could you comment on this? Which one should I choose? Thanks.  ></description> </Issue>

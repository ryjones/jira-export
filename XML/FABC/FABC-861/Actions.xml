CDATA another possible work around which we tested:  1.) Stop the fabric 2.) Remove eca,tca,tlsca,aca x509 certs (cadir/*.cert) 3.) Delete rows from sqllitedb on eca.db that pertain to the enrolment IDs used by the peers. in our case: DELETE FROM Users WHERE id LIKE 'vp%_eid'; DELETE FROM Certificates WHERE id LIKE 'vp%_eid'; 4.) Delete crypto folder on peers so that they are forced to re-enroll 5.) start mebersrvc which will create new x509 certs based on same key material it already has and add entries to users table. 6.) start the peers and they should re-enroll   * Also if you want to change the length of the 90 days going forward you can change this line in the source:  line 113 - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/4491e28f38f4b31efb79fb550c2ea80f64d099f8/membersrvc/ca/ca.go notAfter := notBefore.Add(time.Hour * 24 * 90)  then re-compile the membersrvc  ></body> </Action>

CDATA all certificates created by the CA have validity period of 90 days (hard coded), this includes all the root certificates (e.g. eca.cert.chain, tca.cert.chain) and enrollment specific certificates (e.g. enrollment.cert) sent from CA to peers/SDKs  so if security is turned on, the whole system will basically stop accepting txs after 90 days since the cert verification checks will fail against its certpool (no longer valid)  The work around involve manually creating all certs elsewhere and replace the old ones, but this is not really documented and hectic to do   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The fabric-ca docs need a general review for accuracy and improvements. This includes fabric-ca/docs/source/users-guide.rst, as well as comments in the server and client config files which are automatically generated. Each section in the config files should clearly define how the section and field is used, etc.  Specific improvements include: 1) A description of how the CSR section is used in both the server and client config. 2) In the overview section, describe the cardinality relationships between server, CA, and root/intermediate CA and how/when to use each. 3) Describe the process by which to: a) Rotate the root CA signing cert, similar to: {code} (1) Use "fabric-ca-server init" to generate a new root CA cert, doing in another directory so as not to overwrite the existing one (2) Push the new root CA cert to fabric so that fabric trusts the new and the old equally for some period of time (3) Restart the root CA with the new root CA cert. (4) Enroll intermediate CAs with new root CA. (5) Enroll orderers, peers, and clients as needed with the intermediate CA. (6) Update fabric to forget the old root CA. {code} b) Rotate an intermediate CA signing cert.  ></description> </Issue>

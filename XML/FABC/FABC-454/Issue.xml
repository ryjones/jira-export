CDATA We have a "make ci-tests" target which is run for each change set. We should add a more extensive "make release-tests" target which is run at least once per release, though it could also be run weekly. Thoughts for per release testing include: 1) Increase variables in existing fvt tests which control how many users are added, or other similar variables. 2) Define load tests using the new load driver code (not yet merged).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA All non-absolute file names or path names listed in the COP config file should be made into absolute file paths by looking relative to the location of the config file itself, not relative to the current working directory. For example, the following is currently in fabric-cop/testdata/testconfig.json: {code} "ca_cert":"../testdata/ec.pem", {code} This should simply be: {code} "ca_cert": "ec.pem", {code} and since "ec.pem" is not an absolute path, it is located by looking relative to the location of the config file; therefore, it will be found in the fabric-cop/testdata also, not matter which directory you invoke "cop server start -config ..." from.  Note that file names listed on the command line via arguments are different and must continue to be process relative to the current working directory.   For example, if the -ca option is used as shown below from the fabric-cop directory, then the ec.pem file must be located in the fabric-cop directory, which is the current working directory. {code} cop server start -ca ec.pem -config testdata/testconfig.json {code}    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As of FAB-15388, Fabric will support "admin" OU.  This story will add support in Fabric-CA to issue certificates of type "admin" OU.  Also note the comment from FABC-525: {code:java} No matter which field is used to identify an admin identity, there must be appropriate governance around the issuance of certs with that field. For example, if the flag to identify admin was OU=admin, the CA must issue certs with OU=admin to only the appropriate identities who are intended to be admins. {code}  ></description> </Issue>

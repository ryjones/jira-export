CDATA An admin is restricted from registering a user with a type not defined in his hf.Registrar.Roles. Due to recent restrictions placed on hf.Registrar.Attributes, we can no longer override this type restriction.  Now that we have a mechanism for dynamically adding/modifying a user, there is no way to update the hf.Registrar.Roles with new types.   e.g. consider an admin with an initial hf.Registrar.Roles value defined in the server's registry configuration: hf.Registrar.Roles: "client,user"  Now consider we want to register (add) a user with type 'peer'. admin can't do this, since 'peer' is not in his list. Furthermore, there is no user (including admin) that can update admin's hf.Registrar.Roles value. Even if we restart the server, modify the yaml file to update the hf.Registrar.Roles paramter, then restart the server, the new configuration is not installed since the server will not re-register an existing user. Creating a new admin ID would do the trick, but seems wasteful.  Allowing a wildcard, '*' for  hf.Registrar.Roles hf.Registrar.DelagateRoles would account for any arbitrary type value potentially needed at some later date. Perhaps this should be the default for the bootstrap user?   ></description> </Issue>

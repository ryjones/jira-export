CDATA So it seems to me without this we would "break" how things in v1.0.0 work. Perhaps we really need to take a step back here in general and take a look at all of these roles and attributes.

<Action id="39913" issue="27045" author="smithbk" type="comment" body="Gari, looking back, some of it has turned out to be unnecessary for sure.  For example, affiliations were really only needed for tcerts which will not be used.  And types/roles it turns out aren&apos;t used in fabric, but instead using OUs.  But we didn&apos;t really know that back then.  So given where we are, do you have any ideas about how to simplify and remain compatible?  I can&apos;t think of anything." created="2018-02-09 12:16:09.0" updateauthor="smithbk" updated="2018-02-09 12:16:09.0"/>

CDATA The CI tests (esp on power) are taking far too long. There is a significant amount of network downloads during the build process.   Among other efficiency measures is removing the openldap build. Now that openldap exists in the fabric-fvt test image, the openldap image is superfluous.  At last count the docker build of openldap added ~40 minutes to the CI test on power.  ></description> </Issue>

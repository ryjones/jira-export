CDATA Enables the membership services server by getting certificate(s) issued by Let’s Encrypt, where “lego” stands for “Let’s Encrypt GO client”.  This requires running as root because Let’s Encrypt requires that the caller prove “ownership” of the host by listening on ports 80 and 443 to respond to a query from Let’s Encrypt.  This uses the ACME protocol. This command is used when you do not have your own CA and want membership services to function as your intermediate CA.  This is the preferred option in a production environment when you don’t have your own CA. NOTE: In the future, we may also support “cop server init scep …” to use the SCEP protocol to get certificates.   ></description> </Issue>

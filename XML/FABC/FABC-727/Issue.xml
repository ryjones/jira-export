CDATA There are times when an organization should not have to request revocation information, but revocation information should be pushed to the members on a certain channel. This "pushing" can be done after the revocation is performed for an immediate update to the revocation lists in the other peer nodes/organizations.  In other words, if a certain user needs to be immediately revoked, that revocation is immediately recognized by all nodes on the given channel.  ></description> </Issue>

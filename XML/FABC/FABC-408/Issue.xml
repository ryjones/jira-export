CDATA We have been working for a while with fabric-ca and we realize that fabric-ca cannot work with *Cross Domain* request. This is not an issue if *CA* and *REST* server are in same server located but for other cases, in where for example, web browsers want to directly connect with fabric-ca for registration/enroll purposes, this action is rejected.  The generated error, is the typical *preflight request* not supported message due to missing *CORS* policy on server side HTTP responses  !cors.png!  We should have a configuration option (via yml, env variable, etc) in CA for setting a custom value in response HTTP headers for key {{Access-Control-Allow-Origin.}}  As an example (in *fabric-ca-server-config.yaml*) it can be: # Server's listening port (default: 7054)  port: 7054 # Enables cors origin (default: disabled)  origin: * # Enables debug logging (default: false)  debug: false  ...  Which will become as {{Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * in all HTTP CA Responses}}  Obviously a more fine tuned configuration can be applied using {{Access-Control-Allow-Header and Access-Control-Allow-Method headers}}  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA For places that supports ecdsa, we only need to support ecdsa/256 for v1.  Randomness in testing is OK if/when you can't reasonably test all permutations with each run.  However, if we have this randomness, we must also have a way of replaying a particular test run without randomness in order to reproduce a problem that has occurred.  We can't have it fail once and then just reverify and have it pass because it chose a different random setting.  If there were a way to base the randomness on change set number, that would be ideal from my perspective, but don't know how that would be possible.  Can you think of other ways of accomplishing this?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The idea of randomness is not as all-encompassing as may be implied, e.g. the configuration will not change in a random fashion.  However, there is some. A perfect example of this is the defect that was uncovered by a particular class of serial number that was shorter than average and was prefixed by a leading '0'. In that case, we failed to find a match in the DB due to treating the int as a string.  As an aid to debugging, the log files that are generated in the CI tests always have debugging turned on, so that should help some.  Lastly, each test defines its own CA_CFG directory. As an additional aid to debugging, I could omit the line that deletes this testcase directory at the end of each test (which it does currently). Then, during post-processing done in jenkins, we could tar up the results (also and even including the /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca and /var/lib/mysql and /var/lib/postgres directories).  ></body> </Action>

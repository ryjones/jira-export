CDATA From the code, I found Client gets both of his Ecert and corresponding PrivateKey from COP server in "enroll". But this process may have such problems. 1. Client has his own Public/Private key pairs, and is more likely to get Ecert based on his own PublicKey. 2. For privacy, Client wouldn't like COP server knows his PrivateKey, so Client wants to send (userid, OTP, publicKey) to enroll.  (OTP: one-time password)  So I think it's better to deal with this problem. Solutions I think: 1. provide two different function:  a). Enroll(userid, OTP):  Let COP server to generate Ecert and the corresponding PrivateKey. b). Enroll(userid, OTP, PublicKey): Let COP server use the PublicKey to generate Ecert. 2.  In the source code which has been already implemented, add a field like "PubKey":"XYZ" in the csrJSONFILE to provide Client's PublicKey. When COP server receives the csrJSON, it checks if "PubKey" field exists and provides different services according to this.    ></description> </Issue>

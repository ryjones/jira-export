Furthermore, only certificates with ids that are associated with the caller&apos;s affiliation are currently returned. This check should continue to happen only if requesting certificates based on an enrollment ID. For requests made based on just serial and/or AKI should not require these checks." priority="3" status="10000" created="2018-10-25 16:41:43.0" updated="2019-02-28 16:01:29.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="46309"/>

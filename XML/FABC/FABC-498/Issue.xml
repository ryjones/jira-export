CDATA Checks need to be performed to see that the Registrar has proper authority to register attributes for an identity.   Register an attribute if: 1. The registrar has the hf.Registrar.Attributes attribute with values that matches the attribute or attribute pattern being registered.  See example below. For example, a registrar with the *hf.Register.Attributes* attribute with a value of "a.b,a.c.*" can register a.b and a.c.d, but cannot register a.c or a.d 2. If the attribute being registered is *hf.Registrar.Attributes*, require that the value of the registrar's hf.Registrar.Attribute attribute be equal to or a super set of the value being registered. For example, suppose the registrar has hf.Registrar.Attributes=a.b,a.c.*, then consider the following values of the registree: a) a.b,a.c.* - OK because it is equal b) a.b,a.c.d.* - OK because it is a subset c) a.* - NOT OK because "a.*" contains more attributes than the registrar d) b.* - NOT OK because "b.*" is not contained in the registrar's values/patterns   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Since none of the SDKs support tcerts, it makes no sense for fabric CA to continue to document it and to have this endpoint enabled. Remove this from the documentation so folks are not confused thinking that it is currently supported. And also disable the endpoint for now. The future direction is to use idemix to do this anyway, which does not require talking to the server but does require some integration for ecert issuance.  ></description> </Issue>

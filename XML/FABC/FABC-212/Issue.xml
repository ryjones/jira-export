CDATA The go postgres driver   https://github.com/lib/pq  was recently updated to require goloang>=1.8.Â  This essentially breaks fabric-ca 1.0, since go1.7.2 is in the baseimage.  To compensate, it requires 'locking' in a previous commit of pq that does not require go1.8. To effect this, the Dockerfile will be updated to eliminate the 'go get' command that installs pq and manually clone, checkout, build and install the pq driver.  ></description> </Issue>

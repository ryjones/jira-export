CDATA I like having the option for specifying passwords when registering users rather than always auto-generating them.

The following is in the fabric-ca-client's usage message: {code} --id.secret string             The enrollment secret for the identity being registered {code}  The REST API supports this via the additional "Secret" field in the RegistrationRequest as shown in fabric-ca/api/client.go: {code} // Secret is an optional password.

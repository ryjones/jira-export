CDATA We don't document the pathlen option. Moreover, it appears that we aren't doing anything with it either. Regardless of what I explicitly code for pathlength, e.g. ca: pathlen: 2 pathlenzero: false expiry: I don't see that we're actually adding the extension that includes the pathlength constraint. The generated certificate looks the same either way.  Now we have the ability to create resource authority hierarchies, we actually have a use for this. We should be inserting the pathLenConstraint into the BasicConstraints extension.  ></description> </Issue>

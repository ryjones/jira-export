CDATA Currently, we do not check the status of a certificate being revoked, and unconditionally revoke it again. The effect of this is to update the revocation time.  This creates a potential ambiguity if one were to query the status of the certificate at a specific point in the past. We need to dis-allow multiple revocations of the same certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

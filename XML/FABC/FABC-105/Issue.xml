CDATA Currently, the mask password test will pass even when the result is inconclusive, should the log file be missing or empty.  The test will be updated with the following improvements: * fail if expected passwd value is the null string * fail if expected passwd value contains any character other than '*' * log both to STDOUT (visible in jenkins CI) and to logfile * follow the scheme that creates disjoint test directories for each fvt test * test both the bootstrap init, as well as a registry defined in a pre-exsiting config file  ></description> </Issue>

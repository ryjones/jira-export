CDATA Org1 admin is able to register new users with affiliation "org2.department1"  in Fabric-CA V1.0.x  This behavior is not correct and the same is fixed in Fabric-ca V1.1 but not in V1.0  To run compatibility tests using 1.0 SDK against 1.1 Fabric CA, we propose to fix this in Fabric-CA v1.0.x and also change the SDK integration test suit to reflect the same in release branch.     _Gist of failure logs from SDK_ {code:java} not ok 775 Error: fabric-ca request register failed with errors   \{"code":0,"message":"Registration of 'auditor' failed in affiliation validation: : scode: 401, local code: 44, local msg: Caller does not have authority to act on affiliation 'org2.department1', remote code: 20, remote msg: Authorization failure"}   at IncomingMessage.<anonymous> (/root/Go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/fabric-ca-client/lib/FabricCAClientImpl.js:592:22) at emitNone (events.js:111:20) at IncomingMessage.emit (events.js:208:7) at endReadableNT (_stream_readable.js:1055:12) at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:138:11) at process._tickDomainCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:218:9)  ...

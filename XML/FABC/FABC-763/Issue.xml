CDATA fabric-ca-server and fabric-ca-client both generate config files on initial use if they do not exist.  The problem is that the values of command line flags and/or environment variables are not reflected in the generated config.  This causes confusion for users.  If we want to keep this current behavior, then at a minimum need to document this.  ></description> </Issue>

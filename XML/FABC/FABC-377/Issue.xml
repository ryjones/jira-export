CDATA from the swagger doc, fabric-ca supports query filters when the client do a "GET" request for certificates.  However, it seems the filters does not work, fabric-ca still returned all the certificates that this identity can view.  Here is a debug log for fabric-ca, please see the last two query, one with 'id' and another with 'aki', both query should return only one particular certificate.   ></description> </Issue>

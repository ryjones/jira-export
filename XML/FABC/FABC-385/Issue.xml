CDATA I noticed during testing that different databases exhibit different behaviors regarding case-sensitivity.  Notably, the values that populate the USERS 'name' field is case-sensitive in postgres, but case-insensitive in mysql. Case sensitive makes the most sense in this case.  However, tables names *are* case-sensitive in mysql. I could live with this, but this feels weird. Case insensitive makes more sense here.  The lager issue is that the rules governing the data in any of the DBs should be consistent.  ></description> </Issue>

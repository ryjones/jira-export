CDATA It's possible that membership services is not actually bound to that IP address.  How are you starting membership services and peer containers?  The typical things to look at:  {{ping 172.17.0.2}}  - make sure you can actually access this  {{docker ps}}    - should show which containers are running and if they are exposing any ports.  If you see membership services container with ports exposed, then you can use "localhost:7054" rather than "172.17.0.2:7054"  From the `docker ps` command you'll get the ID and / or name of the membership services container - you can then run {{docker inspect $NAME}} where $NAME is the name of the container.  This will give you the IP that the container is listening on    ></body> </Action>

We manage ping the IP address successfully. but I see ports are not exposed. is there anyway to do?

CDATA Increase test coverage to 85% or more for all fabric-ca packages.  This will be achieved by first vendoring testify, a test framework used in fabric, that simplify test writing. In more details the following new packages are needed: * vendor/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert * vendor/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock and their dependencies: * vendor/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew * vendor/github.com/pmezard/go-difflib * vendor/github.com/stretchr/objx Notice that also fabric vendors the same packages.  Then, packages with test coverage under 85% will be touched to increase the coverage.  ></description> </Issue>

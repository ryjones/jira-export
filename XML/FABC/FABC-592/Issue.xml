CDATA Integrate Idemix certificate issuing and revocation functionality into fabric-ca. Revocation is only partially enabled.   Full revocation support will be enabled within FABC-588.  To support full integration of the Idemix signing functionality, we need a service that would issue enrollment certificates in a form if the Identity Mixer credentials (as it is done now for X.509 certificates using client-sdk and the fabric-ca service).   Currently we have a tool in Go that provides local issuance of the credentials and a crypto library in Java that implements Idemix Issuer key generation and credential issuance.  We need to extend fabric-ca to support certificate issuance and revocation using Identity Mixer crypto library and idemixca implementation for idemixgen tool for signing user attributes in a form of an Idemix credential. Attribute and CRL management on a high level would be the same as for X.509 certificates and will remain unchanged.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently there are several (default) configuration path/files in the code and documentation, e.g., {{/var/hyperledger/fabric/.ca}}, {{/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca}} and {{~/.ca}}.   This is a little confusing, as discussed with  ~greg.haskins  and  ~JonathanLevi .  IMHO, it would be better to solve soon.  3 steps can be taken:  1. Use unique configuration path/files by default, e.g., /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca. 2. Write clear documentation describing where are the configurations, what they are used. 3. Support passing configuration variables through environment variables and config params.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Thank you  ~baohua  for opening this ticket. Adding  ~lehors  as well to this. We had a chat about this the other day (last week) on Slack, and I, too, believe that at this point we should probably use *fabric-ca* across the board.  (Other) suggestions welcome.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA I'd like to make the server and client different as I think it makes the most sense.  For server, the default home directory is /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca and the default config file name in that directory is server-config.json (or we may soon support yaml, in which case it would be server-config.yaml).  For client, the default home directory is $HOME/.fabric-ca and the default config file name in that directory is client-config.json (or client-config.yaml).  Thoughts?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The new config work based on cobra/viper took care of this.  The readthedocs now specifies clearly where config files are, and we also support config through env vars and command line parms.   ></body> </Action>

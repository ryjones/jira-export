This is not how issuer public/private keys are stored, which are stored on the file system. Later when Idemix supports BCCSP APIs, BCCSP will be used to manage the private keys.  For the sake of consistency and to support future release of BCCSP that has support for managing Idemix keys, we should store the revocation keys on the disk." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-05-24 19:03:25.0" updated="2018-07-18 22:04:17.0" resolutiondate="2018-05-31 20:13:10.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="32505"/>

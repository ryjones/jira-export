CDATA Currently the CA does not constrain lifetime of certificates that it issues to be within its own expiry. The notAfter date of any issued certificate should not postdate the notAfter date of the issuer. So if the intermediate CA's signing certificate expires at time T, then the notAfter date of the any certificate that it issues should not be after time T. The same goes for a certificate issued by a root CA.  ></description> </Issue>

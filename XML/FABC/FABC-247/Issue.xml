CDATA An intermediate CA acts like a client when contacting the root CA to get it's certificate. There are certain configuration that can be set for an intermediate CA, such as TLS parameters. These parameters are currently missing from the command line and prevent users from correctly configuring an intermediate CA from the command line.   *Reproduction:* # Enable TLS on Root CA # Start an Intermediate CA using 'https' ( https://localhost:7054)|https://localhost:7054)/  as the protocol to connect to secure socket on Root CA. This will fail as TLS was not configured for intermediate CA. A flag similar to --intermediate.tls.certfiles is missing from the command line     ></description> </Issue>

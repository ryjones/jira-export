Once we&apos;ve identified the big ones, we need to create wrapper functions which allow us to set a variable which causes the wrapper function to return an error.  This will allow us force the code down certain error paths for more complete coverage." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2017-08-14 19:45:51.0" updated="2018-07-20 19:17:03.0" resolutiondate="2017-10-05 08:59:11.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="32706"/>

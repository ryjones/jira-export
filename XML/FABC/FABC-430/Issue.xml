CDATA Please see also an earlier item discussing this requirement in  issue-474|https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/474   Signed certificates are used to verify identities, affiliations and/or other attributes. ECerts in Fabric (MS) are used after successful enrollment (at the early steps on the on-boarding of users to the permissioned chain). Currently ECerts do not expire.  Users can change jobs, businesses may change ownership, private keys get leaked, and other events might warrant a revocation of a certificate. However, while a certificate has not been actively revoked "ahead of time", Fabric (Membership Services) should not provide certificates that do not expire on one hand. Similarly, we should be careful enough as to not leak sensitive information relating to a certificate's creation time.  A certificate validity period is the time interval during which the issuer/signer warrants that one should respect the certificate between the standard *Not Before* and *Not After* X.509 v3 fields.  ></description> </Issue>

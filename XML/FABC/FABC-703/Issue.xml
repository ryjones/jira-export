CDATA The behaviour of the Fabric CA client appears to have changed in 1.2   {code:bash} fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://user:pass@my-fabric-ca.com {code}   now returns:  {code:bash} Error: Response from server: Error Code: 2 - No authorization header {code}  This worked without issue in Fabric 1.1  -----------  Instead, specifying the port explicitly gives me the following error (I'm guessing because the Fabric CA is behind an NGINX proxy with HTTPS enabled):  {code:bash} fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://user:pass@my-fabric-ca.com:80 {code}  now returns:  {code:bash} http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client {code}  In Fabric 1.1, this worked fine, with the http request handled correctly, and the authorization headers being properly set by the client without a need to explicitly set the port.  ----------  If I try to directly access via HTTPS:  {code:bash} fabric-ca-client enroll -u https://user:pass@my-fabric-ca.com {code}  now returns:  {code:bash} 2018/08/14 12:35:59  INFO  TLS Enabled Error: Failed to get client TLS config: No TLS certificate files were provided {code}  In the latter, I want the Fabric CA to be protected by HTTPS encryption to it, but for it not to require the client to provide a TLS certificate.  ></description> </Issue>

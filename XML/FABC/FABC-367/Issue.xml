CDATA Presumably, one of the purposes of having a --gencrl flag on the revoke cmd is to get a cRL that includes the newly-revoked certificate. However, because of a timing issue, the CRL that is generated by the revoke cmd with the --gencrl flag does not always include the cert being revoked. In particular on the s390 build machines, this is nearly always the case. It is because the 'revokedbefore' time that is passed in to generate the CRL is just slightly behind the actual revoke time, and misses the newly-revoked cert.    ></description> </Issue>

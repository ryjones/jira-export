CDATA The fabric-ca-server will support tcerts which means transactions are anonymous and unlinkable, unless revealed to an auditor.  This story is to provide tools which can be used to reveal such information to an auditor.  The following is my 1st pass at the info that COP could reveal, in priority order.  I am looking for feedback on this list and the priority.  Please comment.  # Let auditor see everything related to a single transaction # Let auditor see all transactions for a specific enrollment ID # Let auditor see all transactions for a specific instance of COP.  Assuming a 1-1 relationship between COP servers and participants/organizations, this is equivalent to auditing an entire company or organization. # Let auditor see all transactions for all users in a specific affiliation group.  Each COP can have a hierarchy of affiliation groups.  An auditor can see all transactions for all users in any group of this hierarchy. # Let auditor see a specific attribute in a specific transaction.  Attributes can be encrypted with separate keys, so this means the auditor may be allowed to see one attribute of a transaction but not another.  ></description> </Issue>

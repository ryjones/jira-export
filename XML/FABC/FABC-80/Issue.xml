CDATA Currently the group is stored as a single value in the database for a user. Want to convert group to "affiliation" in the database that will have the whole tree represented in the column. It will be seperated by '/'. For example, the following tree:  - banks_and_institutions -- banks --- bank_a  will be represented as "banks_and_institutions/banks/bank_a" for a user associated with this group hierarchy.   This is being proposed cause an ecert will now have the affiliation path instead of just the group name. When it comes time for tcert generation, the affiliation path can be easily used to find the root group and the corresponding root pre key that will then be used to generate the child group's prekey.  ></description> </Issue>

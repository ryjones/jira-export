CDATA Can we elaborate/say a few words on why is the proposal to store the entire path is good/better?

CDATA There are two reasons that storing a path is preferable to storing just a group name. 1) We can regenerate a group's prekey given only the root prekey + the pathname.  If we stored only the group name, we would have to access the path to that group name or to get the prekey of the parent.  Anyway, it would require that the group hierarchy be stored persistently in a separate table. 2) If we store only the group name, then the group names must be globally unique.  Since we store the path, we can reuse a group name in different parts of the hierarchy. For example, "/a/b/d" and "/a/c/d" are 2 paths and the group name "d" is reused.  ></body> </Action>

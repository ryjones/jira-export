CDATA Investigate doing away with the need for a separate DB for certificates but also use LDAP for storage of certificates. See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/archived/LDAP-Implementation-HOWTO/certificates.html Further, could/should we support the registration APIs with LDAP? Basically, I'm suggesting that externally the APIs look the same but internally we use LDAP for everything persistent.  ></description> </Issue>

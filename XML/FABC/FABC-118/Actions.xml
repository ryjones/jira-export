CDATA This bug is not reproducible with what is in master currently. I validated manually and we also have unit test cases which make sure the IsCA bit is set when starting an intermediate CA; otherwise, it would fail to start. I just spoke with Allen and he agrees and will cancel this jira item and will abandon the change set.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA First, this is great new  ~smithbk  and  ~rennman  - thanks for the update!  Please can either of you advise how do you suggest we treat the  http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/10533  CR then?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This change was precedented on a change in lib/clientconfig.go that is not (and presumably will not be) merged. Consequently, this CR is unnecessary.  I have tested the current iteration of intermediateca_test.sh and the test succeeds.  ></body> </Action>

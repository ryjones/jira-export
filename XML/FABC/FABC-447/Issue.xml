CDATA There are multiple facets to this issue. All are suggested improvements, although 1 will eventually surface as a bug if not addressed.  1) Primarily, when we use postgres/mysql the attribute entries in the DB are fixed at 256 chars. As the need for internally-defined attributes has evolved (roles, delegate, revoker, intCA), we are bumping up against this limit. There is little room left for additional attribute definitions. In particular, user-defined attributes may be unpredictably large.  2) Secondly, inconsistent behavior. I do not see the behavior in sqlite3. sqlite3 seems to dynamically grow the size of the table entry.  Â   3) Lastly, there is an efficiency problem. The labels and meta-characters themselves (',' '\{', ':', 'Name' , 'Value') actually take up storage. So for instance, a mere 2 bytes of information, mapping:  a=1  take up 25 bytes of storage, roughly a 12:1 ratio.  ></description> </Issue>

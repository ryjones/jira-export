CDATA Unless convinced otherwise, I think attribute names should remain case sensitive. The reason this was considered is because some test cases were written with for example "hf.revoker" rather than "hf.Revoker" and in the latest release we had to add additional security checks which fail if someone had "hf.revoker".  Rather than making it case-insensitive, the tests should be changed to use "hf.Revoker".  If this is an issue with registered identities, the fix is to use the APIs to remove and add the attribute with the proper case.  ></body> </Action>

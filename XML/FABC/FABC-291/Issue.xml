The implementation enforced case sensitivity for reserved attributes (hf.). Even though, attributes names were originally intended to be case sensitive that check was never really enforced. Since this might break SDKs and users as they might have already registered using lower cases or upper case for these attributes. Attribute name lookup will be case insensitive to prevent breaking users." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="6" created="2018-01-22 17:29:12.0" updated="2018-07-18 22:04:10.0" resolutiondate="2018-02-01 10:53:08.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="32471"/>

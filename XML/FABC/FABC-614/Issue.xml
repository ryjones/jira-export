CDATA The membership services APIs need to be simplified and made available as a library which can be reused.  For example, APIs might include: 1) constructor which takes a cert to use as the root certificate for this instance of a MS object 2) methods on the MS object to: RegisterUser EnrollUser Set/DeleteUserAttribute GetBatchOfTransactionCertificates etc  Also include SPIs for this library for: 1) authentication during enrollment 2) getting attribute values 3) where to store it's persistent data In particular, it should be possible to plugin an oauth implementation for both 1 & 2, or perhaps they should be a single SPI which does both?   ></description> </Issue>

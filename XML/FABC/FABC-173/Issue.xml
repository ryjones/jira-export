CDATA Run the "fabric-ca-client enroll -u <URL>" command twice with two different <URL> values.  The first one creates the config file with the 1st URL. When you run the command with a different URL on the command line, it uses the <URL> stored in the config file rather than the one from the command line arg.  The command line arg should override what is in the config file.  ></description> </Issue>

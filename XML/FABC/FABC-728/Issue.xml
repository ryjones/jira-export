CDATA In talks with support team, they mentioned a serviceability improvement in regards to CA's connection to the database.  In IBM Blockchain Platform, MySQL is used as the back-end database for a CA and there have been issues where MySQL goes into a super read only mode. This is mainly a MySQL issue, but if the CA could provide information about the connection to its back-end database that could be helpful. For example, the "cainfo" command could report something like it is connected to <location> as the back-end data store and then provide information on the state of that connection.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Since the initial release of Fabric CA, the list of reserved attributes (hf.*) has grown. A certain subset of users upon migration from an older version of CA to a newer one should be given any newly introduced attributes that have been added in the new release.  *Reasons this is needed:*  1. Allow the bootstrap user to continue to have full access to all the functionality available on the CA.  2. During registration of new identities the registrar can only give a new identity attributes that it currently posses. If after migration to a new CA, no identities posses the newly added attributes it becomes impossible to register new identities with these new attributes.  *Proposal*  In 1.1, migration logic was added to handle the `hf.Registrar.Attributes` attribute. See:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/14935/15/lib/ca.go#1170   The logic needs to be extended to handle `hf.AffiliationMgr` and `hf.GenCRL`. This should be fixed in master and also backported in to previous releases.   Â   ></description> </Issue>

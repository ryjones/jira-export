CDATA The client keystore is put in the wrong location, which has the side effect that it breaks the reenroll command.  The problem is that it was not being made absolute relative to the config file.  To reproduce the problem: 1) fabric-ca-server start -b a:b Switch to another terminal 2) fabric-ca-client enroll http://a:b@localhost:7054 3) fabric-ca-client reenroll The final command fails saying that it is not enrolled.  This is because it can't find the msp and keystore directory.  ></description> </Issue>

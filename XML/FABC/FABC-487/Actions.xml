CDATA This is a duplicate of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4844 though the way this is fixed is different.  There is still one server call but the client splits the chain into two parts and stores them in MSP format appropriately. See https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10717/  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Actually, what if i am using more than one intermediate CA servers, and the enroll call is only made on one, I think we still require to get the cacerts of all the intermediate CA servers. So probably, FAB-4844 will solve half of the problem, but not all of it.Â   There is still a need for such an API to get intermediate CAs cert without the chain included.  ></body> </Action>

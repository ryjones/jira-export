CDATA Trying to use multiple levels of CA's with the peer/orderer, we figured that the peer code does not like a chain in the intermediatecerts and the cacerts of msp. But the getcainfo call returns the whole chain for the intermediatecert.     It would help if we can have a call for getting the whole chain (as we have now), and a different call for getting just CA's part of the cert. This will help CA to be in sync with the msp certs that the fabric itself needs.  ></description> </Issue>

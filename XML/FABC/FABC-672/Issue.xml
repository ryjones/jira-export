CDATA The "HSM friendly way" of generating TCerts is a method which does not require use of a key derivation function. Instead, the client effectively generates a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) for each TCert which is to be issued by the Fabric-CA server. This method is not as efficient from both a performance or key storage perspective compared to the method which uses a key derivation function to derive a TCert from an ECert.  The "HSM friendly" method is also known as "option 2" because it was labeled "Approach 2" in this design doc: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/attachment/10360/mserv-TCertOptions-v3(1).md  ></description> </Issue>

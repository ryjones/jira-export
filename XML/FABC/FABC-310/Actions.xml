CDATA I confirm this behavior in rel 1.0.2: it is very annoying when simulating registration/enrollment uses cases mixing interactions with fabric-ca-client (CLI) and fabric-ca-client from fabric-node-sdk (TLS enabled)  For instance, an attempt to register a user from the CLI then enrolling it from a nodejs client is a messy process (overwrite breaks the config) although it works like a charm when performing both operations from the node client.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="38210" issue="22025" author="aambati" type="comment" body="After trying different solutions to fix this problem user friendly way, we decided that best way to fix this problem is to change MSP to support tlscerts and change peer to use the msp to get tls cert and key for TLS communication. Until then, best way to get around this problem is to use different MSP directory using -M option when invoking TLS enroll fabric-ca-client command" created="2018-01-05 03:01:10.0" updateauthor="aambati" updated="2018-01-05 03:01:10.0"/>

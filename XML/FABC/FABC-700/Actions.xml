CDATA Note, this isn't really a 'user story', at least it doesn't read as one. Typically: as a SOMEUSER, I CAN DO SOMETHING, so that I can RATIONALE. It basically describes a test.

CDATA RSA Signature creation and validation has been implemented. Now there is one method to verify both RSA and EC Signature in TCert request. This implementation is required to support existing certificate as ECert and customer might be having RSA cert as well.  The API looks like  GetCertificateSet(TCertRequestJson string , signatureJson string) (string , error) TCertRequestJSON has TCertRequest Parameters  signatureJson contains Signature and Certificate. It returns JSON string containing batch of TCerts.  Next step is to use CFSSL to get TCerts. Will evaluate if CFSSL will be able to serve the request.  Q : Which digest algorithm we are supporting ?    ></body> </Action>

CDATA This is Bhargav from a customer pilot. This occurs only when customer tries to use create customer private key to configure. This issue not an issue if we create prirvate key with openssl tooling.  We can explain the problem more clearly in a phone call if you need. Thanks.        ></body> </Action>

CDATA Hi Gari,     Thank you for your update.  Where would I find information in our fabric-ca documentation which tells us the supported or recommended Private-Key Information Syntax Standard to be used? This way we would know which Private-Key Information Syntax Standard to be used or to be not used when private keys are being created.     My apologies if this information is already documented and I missed finding it. Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Bharghav,  I'll use this jira item to update the doc and the comments in the default configuration file to state that encrypted key files are not supported.  More specifically, the "ca.keyfile" must be a PEM-encoded ECDSA key and must not be encrypted.  That is, it must start with {code} -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- {code} and not be encrypted as the following indicates {code} -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- {code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Dear Keith,  Per doc this is what I found:  Algorithms and key sizes  The CSR can be customized to generate X.509 certificates and keys that support both RSA and Elliptic Curve (ECDSA). The following setting is an example of the implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve prime256v1 and signature algorithm ecdsa-with-SHA256:  key: algo: ecdsa size: 256 The choice of algorithm and key size are based on security needs.  Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) offers the following key size options:  size	ASN1 OID	Signature Algorithm 256	prime256v1	ecdsa-with-SHA256 384	secp384r1	ecdsa-with-SHA384 521	secp521r1	ecdsa-with-SHA512 RSA offers the following key size options:  size	Modulus (bits)	Signature Algorithm 2048	2048	sha256WithRSAEncryption 4096	4096	sha512WithRSAEncryption    ></body> </Action>

CDATA Currently, we have to manually update the fabric-ca doc everytime a new configuration option is added to fabric-ca.   A script to help automate this would make it easier to maintain the readme. The script would pull in CLI flags from client and server and create a file, the same would also be done for configuration file templates. The main fabric-ca readme would then point to these files as appropriate.   ></description> </Issue>

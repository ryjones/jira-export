CDATA To reproduce the problem, issue the following command. {code:java} # fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 -M /tmp/msp{code} The keystore directory is created at /tmp/msp/keystore but the key is stored incorrectly in the $HOME/.fabric-ca-client/msp/keystore directory.  This means that when the -M option is used to enroll an orderer or peer, the key is not accessible to the orderer or peer.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA When starting up a CA, in the CSR section a CN can be specified that will be used to generate a self-signed certificate if a root CA. However, when a CA is acting like an intermediate it should not be able to specify CN. An intermediate CA, acting like a client, will enroll with the root CA by providing its enrollment ID and password. The enrollment ID will take place of the CN in the certificate. An error should be thrown if an intermediate CA tries to specify a CN.  *Reproduction:*  1. On intermediate CA, execute the following: fabric-ca-server start -u http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054 -b admin:adminpw --csr.CN notadmin  No error is thrown  ></description> </Issue>

No matter how the request is configured in the command line or the fabric-ca-client.yaml the generated signing certificate is always cert.pem. While it is possible to rename the certificate manually this matches neither the behavior of the cryptogen tool used in the first-network example nor the fabric-ca-server.config.yaml when initializing a server. For example, the cryptogen tool  has the signing certificates named according to organization and role, peer0.org1.example.com-cert.pem, and you can specify certificate names under both the tls properties and ca properties of the fabric-ca-server-config.yaml. It would be beneficial to allow the client to specify the name of the signing certificate generated during an enrollment request." priority="4" status="10100" created="2018-08-23 17:19:40.0" updated="2019-07-27 14:59:48.0" votes="1" watches="2" workflowId="44381"/>

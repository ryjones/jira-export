<Action id="50195" issue="33170" author="jvsclp" type="comment" body="Noticed an issue that may be needed to be taken into account if naming the certificate file on generation with fabric-ca-client is implemented. As an admin, when the FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME environment variable is set to the administrator&apos;s certificate location for registering an identity the only valid file name recognized within the administrator&apos;s msp/signcerts directory is cert.pem. If you rename the certificate manually fabric-ca-client will not recognize the renamed certificate despite having the correct credentials to perform a user registration." created="2018-09-10 21:58:29.0" updateauthor="jvsclp" updated="2018-09-12 20:46:14.0"/>

CDATA Make the usage for the `cop client register` command as follows: {code} cop client register <enrollmentID> -type {client | peer | orderer} -group <affiliationGroupName> -attr <name>=<value> -url <serverURL> -jsonfile <registrationInfoFileName> {code} Allow a single instance of all options except the 'attr' option, since we want to allow multiple attributes to be associated with a single user. The 'jsonfile' is a file of the following form.  If both the 'jsonfile' and another option is used, the value of the option argument should take precedence of what is in the jsonfile. {code} { "id": "test_user", "type": "client", "group": "bank_a", "attrs":  {"name":"test","value":"testValue"}  } {code}  The default value of -type is "client".  No other options have a default value.  The overall precedence of where to get these values is: 1) option argument is highest precedence 2) value in json file is next, if -jsonfile option is used 3) environment variable (assuming viper is used, this should be easy) 4) the value in the $COP_HOME/config.json file as set by a "cop setenv" command.  ></description> </Issue>

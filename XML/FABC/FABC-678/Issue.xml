CDATA I followed the external instructions posted on IBM docker hub v0.6.   I start up a single node network.   If I log on using this CLI with incorrect pw ->  'peer network login test_user0 -p xxxxxxxxx' it fails as expected.  If I then log on with correct pw 'peer network login test_user0 -p MS9qrN8hFjlE' it fails which is not expected  Note this is on v0.6.  If this is specific to v0.6 then priority would be very low otherwise it would be high.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA fabric-ca-gosec-weekly, fabric-ca-safesql-weekly jobs fail consistently and these jobs run once a week.  fabric-ca-gosec-weekly: This job do goscan for the packages `api lib util cmd vendor1`  fabric-ca-safesql-weekly:  This job runs safesql scan for the fabric-ca repo.  And the question is do we still required to maintain these jobs as they were failures observed every time and the supporting files were touched last time on Feb 2018.  ></description> </Issue>

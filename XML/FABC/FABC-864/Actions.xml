CDATA The job is failing because the result of scan is false positive. Hence it is non-voting job running weekly. To remove false positive , we need to change the code , which is not desirable.  Â   The job is required to meet various Security and Compliance requirements of code scanning. Please do not kill this job  ~vijaypunugubati . Thanks.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Who reads the reports generated by the scans. I say this because the vendor directory hasn't been scanned literally ever, the test is improperly performed and the vendor directory returns without any packages having been detected. If someone was reading the reports they would notice the vendor1.json file contains no scans.  Having performed the scan manually, there are several high vulnerabilities in the vendor directory, and many medium and low sev issues in the other directories. While I understand these may be required for some type of compliance, but who is reading them to ensure we are "compliant," because they aren't working in their current state, and clearly no one is reading them if the report is empty and console output of the job shows the vendor part of the job failed?  We are inventorying jobs as these will need to be ported to the new CI system in the upcoming weeks, so we need to make sure if these are needed, that they are fixed appropriately, and that the right people are notified when HIGH/MED sev vulnerabilities are found in the code base. We need to decide what a healthy state is for these tests as well. We need to modify the job to only report a failure if it is truly a failure condition ( such as High Sev issues), as the new CI dashboards will be showing the actual health of the project now so we can actually triage real problems unlike today's state of CI.

CDATA  ~btl5037   ~vijaypunugubati  I discussed with  ~ashutosh_kumar  and we determined that for known false positives, we will whitelist them so that the job does not fail going forward due to false positives.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Sorry, I submitted a CR a while ago for this but it became out of sync with master while waiting to be merged and I have not had a chance to fix it.  Unfortunately as new tests with similar flaws get added to the repo the situation gets worse making this effort a bit like a never ending chasing game.  I will try to get to it early next week. Here is the related CR:  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/14191/  ></body> </Action>

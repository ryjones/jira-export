CDATA The unit-tests are not independent from one another and don't clean up after themselves. A lot of temporary files are left behind, not just in /tmp but in the source hierarchy.  FAB-5426 moves us in the right direction but more needs to be done.  This can be demonstrated by doing the following for instance:  fabric-ca/lib $ go test -run CLIClient >log 2>&1  fabric-ca/lib $ git status  On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. Untracked files:   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)      log     testservers/     ../testdata/msp/  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)  fabric-ca/lib $ go test >log 2>&1  fabric-ca/lib $ ls -l /tmp total 44 drwxr-xr-x 2 lehors lehors 4096 Sep 28 14:36 dbtesting drwx------ 2 lehors lehors 4096 Sep 28 14:35 keystore drwxr-xr-x 2 lehors lehors 4096 Sep 28 14:35 signcerts ...  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA In fabric-ca/api/client.go, change the "Group" field name to "AffiliationPath". The name "group" is confusing because typically a user can be in multiple groups. Also, this will make the code simpler and more flexible to allow a group name to be reused in multiple nodes in the affiliation group tree.  Part of this work was done in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1511, but we need to finish it with this task.  ></description> </Issue>

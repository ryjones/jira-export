CDATA We need to test this out of course, but it should be possible today given two assumptions: 1) You must manually copy the key materials to the new COP server and start it; 2) The load balancer (e.g. haproxy) must support dynamically adding a new server to a cluster. Assigning to Saad to investigate, test, and doc with haproxy.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I should add that if we were to implement https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1465, you would not need to manually distribute keys as mentioned in #1 above.  This would enable having a cluster of COP intermediate servers.  When you needed to add new COP servers to the cluster, you would issue the "cop server init -remote <root-COP-server>" command with an enrollment ID and secret, and the new cluster members would dynamically get an intermediate signer certificate.  That said, we are currently beginning to focus on documentation and more testing for what we have already implemented, so work on FAB-1465 is not currently progressing.  ></body> </Action>

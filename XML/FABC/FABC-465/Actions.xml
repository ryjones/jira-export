CDATA To set max enrollment value to zero, you must specify '-2' as max enrollment in modify request.   The following is present in the Readme:  NOTE: A maxenrollments value of "-2" specifies that the CA's max enrollment setting is to be used.   ~rennman  Can you please test and verify?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Verified that -2 is required on a modify to indicate taking the server default.  However, it is inconsistent with the '0' that is the equivalent for an 'add'. Moreover it is still stored in the DB as '0' even if -2 is supplied on the command line, which is sort of confusing for the user.  The preferred behavior is:   1  - user doesn't set maxenrollments on modify (nil):         internally set maxenrollments to '-2' and leave current value alone.   2 - user specifies '0':        explicitly set maxenrollments to '0' this requires changing the meaning of -2, but it never gets externalized.  The problem is  "...there is no way to indicate if user set 0 or the default integer value of zero. maybe once this viper bug is fixed, we might able to do that.  https://github.com/spf13/viper/issues/276 "  Hence I'm leaving this open as a suggested future improvement.      ></body> </Action>

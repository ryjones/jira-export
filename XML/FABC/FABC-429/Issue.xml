CDATA It would be nice to have the option of specifying full path of configuration file like:  peer node start -c /path/to/core.yaml  I am aware that we can manipulate where the peer looks for configs with GOPATH and simply in its pwd. Also aware that we can override options with ENV VARS. However specifying the default config location as a parameter seems like a more natural way of accomplishing this.  ></description> </Issue>

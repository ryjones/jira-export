CDATA Fabric V1 bases most of the policies for endorsement, channels, etc on the concept of members.  Each member is able to use their own membership service provider (MSP) and one way to differentiate MSPs is for each member to use their own root authority.  We can support this with fabric-ca by spinning up multiple instances, but it might be more convenient to provide an option (possibly for dev / test only) to support multiple root authorities within a single instance of the fabric-ca server.  ></description> </Issue>

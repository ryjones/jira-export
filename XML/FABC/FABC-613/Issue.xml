CDATA fabric-ca-server will update the CRL in fabric when: a) certificates are revoked in fabric-ca-server, and b) optionally also when certificates have been expired for a while, thus pruning the CRL.  This can only be done though if/when fabric honors expiration times. COP will prune the CRL list when a certificate has expired.  For now, we will do only "a".  Updates to fabric include MSPs in the channels associated with a peer. Also update the local MSP when an API is provided to update the local MSP.  ></description> </Issue>

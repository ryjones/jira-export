CDATA * Extend view change during ordering cases with NODE txs ** Start with a simple sending of different combination of NODE txns interleaved with view changes ** Consider adding new Replicas in sim tests once a new NODE is added/promoted as well as removing Replicas when  there is NODE txn for demotion It may be easier to do this after INDY-2262 is done.  ></description> </Issue>

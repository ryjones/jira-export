CDATA *Description:* Send lot of invalid requests (malformed txns, double spend like registering an already registered nym)  *Findings:* There is no special handling on malformed or redundant transactions. It was verified in both of points of view: from CLI and using load_test.py CLI: sending about 10 transactions with incorrect syntax manually and sending 10 NYMs with the same identifier in dest. The next invalid transaction is handled absolutely the same as the previous one. The system works correctly after these actions.  load_test.py: sending lots of send NYM transactions with incorrect syntax and with the same identifier in dest parameter. Interesting behavior was noticed while using load_teat.py - If we run script without --at-once key, all works as expected: first transaction succeeded, the rest ones are failed. - If we run script with --at-once key with the same parameters there are two different cases: -- 2-500 transactions: all transactions are succeeded, cluster is not crashed. -- 1000 transactions: about first 100-200 transactions are succeeded, the rest ones are failed. Pool is crashed after completion of the test.    The version of script which was used for testing is attached:  ^load_test_inv.py   *Summary:* - All works correctly in point of view CLI.  - All works correctly in case of running load_test.py without --at-once key. - There are problems in case of running script with --at-once key. They are described in INDY-292.  ></description> </Issue>

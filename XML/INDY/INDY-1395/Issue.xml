CDATA We already log if a request wasn't ordered in 1 minute specifying the nodes that didn't participate in consensus.  We need to log what nodes didn't participate even for ordered requests so that we can detect what nodes may have problems  Â   *Acceptance criteria* * If a node didn't participate in ordering of N sequential requests (that is no PREPAREs nor COMMITs received from the node), we need to log a warning: "Node X didn't participate in ordering of N requests"  ></description> </Issue>

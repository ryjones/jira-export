<Issue id="16709" key="INDY-5" number="5" project="10303" reporter="kelly.wilson" assignee="victor.muzychenko" creator="ryjones" type="10004" summary="CLONE - No error messages when TCP connection is not available for ZMQ" description="I spent many hours trying to figure this one out.The issue was I had setup a network before our ZMQ builds allowing UDP ports 9701-9799, but not TCP ports. This was working with RAET. When we had switched to ZMQ the system no longer worked because the TCP port range 9701-9799 was not allowed through my firewall.No error messages were thrown telling me there was an issue with TCP or to check my firewall.We found the issue by looking up the messages we were getting in debug mode within the Zstack.py file. After walking through the code it occured that we did not have TCP ports open.*We need an error message thrown if the TCP port range 9701-9799 is not open.**Here is the section of code we traced the issue to, but again this only returned DEBUG messages and an ERROR needs to be thrown.*{code}    def transmit(self, msg, uid, timeout=None):        # Timeout is unused as of now        assert uid in self.remotes        socket = self.remotes uid .socket        if socket:            msg = self.prepMsg(msg)            try:                # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences                socket.send(self.signedMsg(msg), flags=zmq.NOBLOCK)                logger.debug(                    &apos;{} transmitting message {} to {}&apos;.format(self, msg, uid))                return True            except zmq.Again as ex:                logger.debug(&apos;{} could not transmit message to {}&apos;.format(self, uid))                return False        else:            logger.warning(&apos;{} has uninitialised socket for remote {}&apos;.                        format(self, self.remotes uid ))            return False{code}" priority="2" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2017-05-12 19:11:00.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:31.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:31.0" votes="0" watches="0" workflowId="16713"/>

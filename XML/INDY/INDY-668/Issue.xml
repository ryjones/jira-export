So there would be different multisigs for each ledger. Only the pool ledger needs to be anchored to the different ledgers, so the identity ledger and config ledger would have periodic entries specifying the sequence number from the pool ledger . Each ledger has a unique id. Pool ledger has id 0, identity ledger has id 1, config ledger has id 1. Identity ledger and config ledger will have entries like this:	{type: “anchor”, ledger_id: 0, root_hash: af190be3341ac, seq_no: 32}" priority="3" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:24.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:57.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:57.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19856"/>

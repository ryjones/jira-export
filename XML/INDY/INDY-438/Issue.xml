CDATA "Some nodes have ordered different requests and hence roots are different, logs and ledger confirm this"  Lovesh and Kelly are working through this issue. All we know so far is what Lovesh has stated above.  This ticket is to track our findings and the fix.  Setup 10 Physical Nodes 10 Physical Clients  I setup the load_test.py script to run from each of the 10 clients.  I then ran the load_test.py script from each of the 10 clients all sending 500 requests each at the same time.  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 500 --at-once  I should have seen 5.000 transactions, but after 2,000 the pool stopped accepting new transactions.  ></description> </Issue>

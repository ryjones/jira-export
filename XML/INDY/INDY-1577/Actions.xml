CDATA  ~ashcherbakov  says that demoted replicas are only replaced during a view change.  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1541?focusedCommentId=48778&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-48778  I have observed demoted replicas being replaced following a view change.   ~ashcherbakov  or  ~spivachuk ,  This issue can be closed if this is expected behavior. However, it would be nice to have answers to the following before closing this issue:  1. If demoted replicas are not replaced until a view change occurs, are the demoted replicas expected to continue to participate in consensus on it's own protocol instance until the next view change? It would make sense that it would/could without any negative side effects. Doing so allows the demoted node to resume it's role as a replica and eliminates the need for catch up in the event that the demoted node is promoted back to "VALIDATOR" before a view change occurs (demote and promote before a view change).  2. I was thinking that setting a node's "services" to blank ("") effectively "blacklisted" the node, but  ~slafranca  says he believes that demotion and blacklisting are two different things. If so, is there a way to programmatically blacklist a node and how would you expect the pool to behave if a replica is "blacklisted" vs. "demoted".  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I have discovered for myself in indy-cli documentation that setting a node's services to blank ("") is effectively termed "blacklisting" a node.  The following is taken from the `ledger node help` output:  "services - (optional) Node type. One of: VALIDATOR, OBSERVER or empty in case of blacklisting node"  ></body> </Action>

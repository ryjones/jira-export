CDATA After we have approved an RC build we found that python3-rlp and python3-sha3 was not copied to the Stable repo. We currently do not have a mechanism when an RC build has been approved to copy those files to the Stable repo.  We copied them manually, but if there is a change to those files they will not be updated unless done manually.  ></description> </Issue>

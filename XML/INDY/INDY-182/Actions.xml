I want to know that we have not simply copied these files, but instead have implemented a mechanism where dependencies get copied to the stable repos when appropriate. Once you&apos;ve identified that mechanism so I can review it, you can set the ticket back to Customer Validation status and reassign to me." created="2017-06-14 04:06:38.0" updateauthor="danielhardman" updated="2017-06-14 04:06:38.0"/>

CDATA  ~danielhardman  to fix the issue at the time I indeed just copied those files. Yet I updated our build script o do it automatically in the future. I need to point out it was not tested properly since it required to release a new stable. We will test it as soon as we build a new stable with some new dependencies.  It was fixed in this commit:  https://github.com/evernym/jenkins-shared/commit/e749c0c90d272c25bf1119039d7662084823f734  ></body> </Action>

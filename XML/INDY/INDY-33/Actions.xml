CDATA Farooq Khan comment - 12/May/17 9:08 AM Function randomString() in common/util.py and debug() in state/utils/utils.py is using the python provided random class which is not a Secure Random generator should be replaced with a SecureRandome generator  Andrey Kononykhin comment - 6 days ago Hello, Farooq Khan I haven't found randomString() in Sovrin-Common but have found in plenum. Did you mean the plenum actually?  Farooq Khan comment - 6 days ago Andrey Kononykhin you are correct It was in plenum  Farooq Khan comment - 6 days ago Found one more instance of Psuedo Random Generator being used. This is even more critical than the other 2. STP:crypto/util.py  Farooq Khan comment - 6 days ago Andrey Kononykhin For all our random number generation needs, I would recommend using libSodium provided APIs. I am not sure if it is available via NACL but that is something we should check. This will ensure portability and security both. libSodium uses appropriate secure random generators on each OS it is supported on.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This has been fixed now, there is no way to test this however except a code review  check the code in plenum/plenum/common/util.py  Ignore the state/state/util/utils.py that is used for logging and need not be using secure random  ></body> </Action>

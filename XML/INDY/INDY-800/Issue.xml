CDATA This is a change in behavior in 1.1.33.  I submitted a transaction to the validator pool: {code:none} sovrin@test> send NYM dest=TKqYL5sMd7xNAuCxGg36Wk verkey=~MvD957ZepR26ZjPx1gYmTZ Adding nym TKqYL5sMd7xNAuCxGg36Wk Nym TKqYL5sMd7xNAuCxGg36Wk added {code} The transaction was successful and the NYM is on the ledger: {code:none} ubuntu@singapore:~$ sudo read_ledger --type domain | grep TKqYL5sMd7xNAuCxGg36Wk  23,{"dest":"TKqYL5sMd7xNAuCxGg36Wk","identifier":"6feBTywcmJUriqqnGc1zSJ","reqId":1504213515840157,"signature":"3TpgWXjt9zsUSSrPm8mJZs1MCAtQc5iiRuJmtT7hbPFoSTLRXCWupQcNMrSAhdj8KEKXScNyLN5WD4CbS28NXjv3","txnTime":1504213514,"type":"1","verkey":"~MvD957ZepR26ZjPx1gYmTZ"}  {code} However, when looking at the logs on the validators at the default INFO level, there is no indication that anything occurred.  All transactions should be have log messages at the INFO level in the validator logs with for at least the following: # Submission # Status, as the submission proceeds through major stages # Success (written to ledger) or failure (not written to ledger) ## When failure occurs, the message should be at the FAIL or WARNING level, and should contain the reason for the failure.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA start node that is in inconsistent state   Things tried: 1. malformed or absent keys files (private_keys, public_keys, sig_keys, verif_keys) in NodeX and NodeXC folders - node doesn't start 2. absent transactions files (pool_transaction_sandbox/1, transactions_sandbox/1, config_transactions/1) - node starts successfully, files create after catchup 3. malformed JSON transactions files pool_transaction_sandbox/1 and config_transactions/1 - node doesn't start 4. malformed non-JSON transactions file transactions_sandbox/1 - node starts successfully 5. absent ldb files (attr_db, config_state, domain_state, idr_cache_db, pool_state, seq_no_db) - node starts and files are recreated 6. malformed ldb files in config_state, domain_state, pool_state - node doesn't start 7. malformed ldb files in attr_db, idr_cache_db, seq_no_db - node starts succesfully  There is an inconsistent behavior in 6th and 7th points, INDY-356 is reported.

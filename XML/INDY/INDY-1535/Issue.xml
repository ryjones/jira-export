CDATA Originally, the force-view-change experiment was designed to discover the master, stop it, and then continue to do so without waiting for a viewchange to complete. Running this version of force-view-change was successful in creating a split master condition, but stopped producing a split master condition once it was changed to wait for a viewchange up to a configurable timeout (360 seconds).   ~krw910  and  ~ckochenower  think a "chase the master" as fast as possible experiment is useful. Therefore, this ticket tracks the need to recreate such an experiment and use it to see how indy-node does under this condition as we improve performance and stability.  ></description> </Issue>

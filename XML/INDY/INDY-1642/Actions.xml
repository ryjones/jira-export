CDATA Reason: * need to change discarded logic in PREPREPARE building and take into account the order of requests while doing dynamic validation  Changes: * as of now, discarded field in PREPREPARE is a bit mask of reqIdrs, when 0 is a valid request and 1 - is not  Version: * indy-node 1.6.590  Recomendation for QA (as in INDY-1638): - run load_test for revocation transactions and check that there is not chain of view_changes by reason "got one of primary suspicions codes 7"Â   ></body> </Action>

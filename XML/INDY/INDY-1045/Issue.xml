CDATA A new Ubuntu software update required a reboot of the nodes of the STN.  The nodes were rebooted one at a time.  Previous to the reboot, the validator-info utility was run and the nodes were in sync, with 255 transactions in the domain ledger on each.  After the reboot, the validator-info utility was run again.  To our surprise, additional transactions had appeared on each node.  Of the seven nodes we have access to, five have 327 transactions, and two have 299.  We need to determine why this occurred and correct it.  The 'korea' node, which is one of the nodes with 299 transactions, has trace-level logging enabled.  Its logs and transactions are attached.  The logs and transactions for 'virginia', a node with 327 transactions, are also attached.   ></description> </Issue>

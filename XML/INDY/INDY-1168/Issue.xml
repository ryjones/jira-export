CDATA The STN is unable to accept new transactions. This has been happening regularly (about every 3 days) for the several weeks, but this time it is different. In the past I have been able to fix this by restarting the 8 nodes that I have access to. This is not restoring the network this time.  It is possible that this is due to a new validator node that was added to the network on Friday evening by a steward that is testing his node prior to adding it to the live network. There are 4 of 12 nodes that I do not have access to.  I have attached logs for the nodes I have access to.  One node, ricFlair, is turned off.  Another node, pcValidator01, was added to the network on Friday evening.  All nodes but recFlair show 'connected' using validator-info.  Shortly before capturing the logs I attempted to post a NYM transaction to to the ledger, to provide debugging data: {code:java} indy@sandbox> send NYM dest=Fuey3pEhVbhMxgZfk7NkYM verkey=~QwZJsuUN7oGxdEby5H6b78 Adding nym Fuey3pEhVbhMxgZfk7NkYM {code} Please determine if this is a known, or a new, unknown failure.  ></description> </Issue>

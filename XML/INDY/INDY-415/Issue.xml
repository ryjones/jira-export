CDATA Build Info: sovrin-node 0.4.20  Overview: Pool fails to send NYMs after POOL_UPGRADE command.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Login as Trustee. 2. Send NYM to prove that it works. 3. Send POOL_UPGRADE command with force=True and 3 nodes in schedule (it should work due to changes in INDY-201), e.g.: send POOL_UPGRADE name=upgrade2 version=0.4.20 sha256=e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 action=start schedule={'8ECVSk179mjsjKRLWiQtssMLgp6EPhWXtaYyStWPSGAb': '2017-07-13T13:35:00.258870+00:00', 'DKVxG2fXXTU8yT5N7hGEbXB3dfdAnYv1JczDUHpmDxya':'2017-07-13T13:20:00.258870+00:00', '4PS3EDQ3dW1tci1Bp6543CfuuebjFrg36kLAUcskGfaA':'2017-07-13T13:25:00.258870+00:00'} timeout=10 force=True 4. Send NYM.  Actual Results: Step 4 NYM sending is failed (there is no result message).  Expected Results: Send NYM should work normally.  Workaround: Restart all nodes of the pool.  Aditional Info: According to INDY-201 comments no validation for uniqueness of upgrade name is ok, but actually this validation is present (see screenshot).  Logs of all nodes are in attachment.  ></description> </Issue>

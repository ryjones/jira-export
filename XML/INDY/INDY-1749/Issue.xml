CDATA We already have windowed throughput measurements for write requests in monitor. It might be sensible to reuse this code for read throughput measurements as well and to use it in validator_info to avoid confusion (INDY-930).   *Things to be determined:* * are we okay with windowed throughput measurements as implemented in monitor * should we use same window size for read and write request throughput measurements * should we use same window size for monitor and validator info * should we output used window size in validator info (it can be configurable and different stewards can potentially set according to their preferences)  It would be nice to have input from  ~krw910 .  ></description> </Issue>

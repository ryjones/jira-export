CDATA  There are several changes in the upgrader behavior related to this bug due to INDY-200 fixes:   1. Upgrade to not latest version (e.g. 0.3.141 -> 0.3.152 (latest 0.3.154) is *successful*.  2. Upgrade to unexisting version breaks the pool: all nodes disconnect every few seconds to perform upgrade and connect back due to upgrade fails. This behavior should be fixed.  ></body> </Action>

Upgrade to not latest version works (it was tested during RC/Stable acceptance testing). 2. Upgrade to nonexistent version doesn't break the pool (it was fixed in INDY-316).  There is one issue with upgrade to nonexistent version now: when upgade fails node tries to reinstall the same version but now we have no migration script for this case and it will be fixed in INDY-755.

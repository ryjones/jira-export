CDATA Log analyzing showed that: * All of 6 stopped writing node failed by "Out of memory error". Kernel will kill the python application unexpectedly and already ordered request can be written in ledger's storage but not in state storage. Therefore, node hasn't consistency storages after restart. Possible way for solving this is to remove state's storages on all nodes. In this case, node will restore state from transaction_log. * "Out of memory" error should be fixed in the scope of INDY-1455 and  INDY-1462|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1462   ></body> </Action>

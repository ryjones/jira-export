CDATA *Story*  As a developer contributing to Indy Node, I need to be able to run experiments on an Indy Network that will cause known or unknown failures and reproduce those network failures in a development environment so that I can diagnose the problem. .  *Acceptance Criteria* * Be able to capture (record) all interactions with an individual node. * Be able to replay these interactions on a single node and cause the same fault from the experiment. * The code is contributed to Indy through a pull request. * Design documents are contributed to Indy as a pull request in Markdown format.  *Notes*  Key terminology: * interaction: all inputs and outputs seen by the node (network, disk, etc) * failure: the network is behaving poorly * fault: a node is behaving poorly * error: a bad event on a node (cpu spike, network outage, etc)Â   ></description> </Issue>

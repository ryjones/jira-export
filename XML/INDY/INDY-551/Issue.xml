<Issue id="19739" key="INDY-551" number="551" project="10303" reporter="avkrishnan" assignee="danielhardman" creator="avkrishnan" type="10001" summary="separate requesting and accepting claims in the CLI commands" description="Following are the changes that needs to be done* Change {{request claim}} command to {{send claim request}}* Response of existing command gets the claim from Issuer and there is no step to accepts it. We need to modify this behaviour, to only get the claim and not accept it. By accept means we means that unaccepted claims cannot be used to generate proof. Only when a user accepts a claim, then it can be used to generate a claim.Things to be taken care of:* Until claim is accepted, it cannot be used in {{&gt; show proof request}} or {{&gt; fulfil proof request}}* Output of {{&gt; show link}} command should output {{Available Claim(s):}} and {{Unaccepted Claim(s)}}. As of now we just show {{Available Claim(s)}}h2.

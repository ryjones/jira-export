CDATA If Endorser points to a DID without a specific role (Node role; common user), then it will be unknown who should be charged.  So, Endorser can point to DIDs with known (not-None) roles only such as TRUSTEE. ENDORSER, STEWARD, etc.  Question: * Can the endorser field contain any defined role (transaction author is an undefined role), or should it only contain DIDs with the role of endorser?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I spoke with Drummond, and we need to make a minor change.  The Endorser field should only contain DIDs with an on-ledger role of Endorser. Trustees and Stewards should not be endorsing 3rd party transactions with their non-Endorser DIDs.  This is important for the Sovrin use case, were Trustees do not have an agreement to pay for writes, and Stewards have a different agreement than most Endorsers. But it is also appropriate for other networks who might have different policies governing endorsers. The endorser field in the transaction should be explicitly tied to the endorser role as an Indy concept.  Thank you for your efforts.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~esplinr  Thank you for clarification, the PR has been updated.  BTW what about a situation when a user collaborated with a malicious Steward and a Steward sends SCHEMA/CLAIM_DEF as a Steward (so that Endorser is not needed), and then the Steward gives all the keys to the user, and a user can use this SCHEMAs/CLAIM_DEFs without paying anything to SF?  ></body> </Action>

We should advise network administrators that if they are concerned about that scenario they should disallow Stewards from creating schema and claim definitions in the auth_rules for their networks.

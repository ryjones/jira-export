CDATA Currently CD pipeline waits for approval after release PR has been created and expects once approval is received the release PR passed all restrictions and the PR is ready to be merged.  Restrictions for now are: * at least one approval review * DCO is passed * CI is passed (_ci/sovrin-foundation-jenkins/pr-merge_ status)  It can be automated: CD continues automatically once all PR checks are passed.

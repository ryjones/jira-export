BLS signatures are calculates independently by each node, and then aggregated to multi-sig by a Primary. And it&apos;s done only during the next batch of txns (so, we have to have a lag in order to get a multi-sig which is the same for all nodes). Do we need something similar for timestamps?" created="2017-08-29 08:18:08.0" updateauthor="ashcherbakov" updated="2017-08-29 08:18:08.0"/>

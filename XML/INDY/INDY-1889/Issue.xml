CDATA Currently inventory-init script exports way too many parameters to group and host vars from ansible roles. Actually there are many exported parameters that probably will never need override. Also, some of exported parameters has Jinja templates as a value which also reduces readability of resulting configuration.  *Acceptance criteria* * Decide on a list of most important parameters for roles which will often require configuration * Restrict parameters exported to group/host vars to this list *  Optional  Allow export of less important parameters to separate group vars files  ></description> </Issue>

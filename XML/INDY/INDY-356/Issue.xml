CDATA Build Info: sovrin-node 0.3.161 sovrin-client 0.3.150  Overview: Node with malformed ldb files has inconsistent behavior.  Steps to Reproduce - Case 1: 1. Delete any symbols from last changed ~/attr_db/ .ldb file. 2. Start the node with malformed ldb file.  Steps to Reproduce - Case 2: 1. Delete any symbols from last changed ~/config_state/ .ldb file. 2. Start the node with malformed ldb file.  Actual Results: 1. Node starts successful if files in ~/attr_db/, ~/idr_cache_db/, ~/seq_no_db/ are malformed. 2. Node fails if files in ~/config_state/, ~/domain_state/, ~/pool_state/ are malformed.  Expected Results: Clarification is needed due to +node starts successful when ALL this ldb files are absent+ (and they are partially recreated during the work with node).  ></description> </Issue>

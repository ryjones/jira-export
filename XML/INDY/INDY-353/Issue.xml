CDATA daniel.hardman  10:37 AM   What are we going to do about timestamps on the ledger? Should we go live without any timestamps? Should we write a consensus timestamp txn to the ledger once a minute?  lovesh  12:28 PM   We have not decided about timestamps yet but a very basic implementation is for the primary to assign a timestamp to a batch of txns and non-primaries to accept the batch only if the timestamp is later than that of a previous batch and lies in a duration (+/- x minutes) around their time, this is how bitcoin does it. We are yet to come to a stage where the time is calculated on the basis of mean/median time or some std deviations away from it (edited)  daniel.hardman  12:36 PM   That sounds quite reasonable. I don't think it's necessary to do anything super fancy yet, but I think we need at least minimal timestamp data on the ledger from the beginning of its history.  *Update:* While implementing this consider what needs to be done when one node finds the timestamp from primary unacceptable? After it see sufficient PREPAREs, it should accept the PRE-PREPARE and take an action to fix its clock. This process is not exactly like bitcoin, as in bitcoin nodes exchange timestamps when they connect to each other and the median value of those timestamps is part the calculation for validating timestamp of the next block  ></description> </Issue>

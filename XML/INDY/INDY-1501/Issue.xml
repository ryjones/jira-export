CDATA *Acceptance Criteria* A document exists in the Indy Node documentation folder that describes the architecture and goals of the current update system.  Key items to document: * The system pushes updates out simultaneously to all nodes on the network. * This allows Indy Node to be upgraded in unison, and avoids the need for backwards compatibility. * Which ledger the upgrade transaction uses. * That the upgrade transaction defines an arbitrary package so that systems building on top of Indy Node can install their own plugins. (INDY-1499) * That Indy Node control tool updates that package using a system appropriate to the specific platform: currently Debian, but could be RedHat or Windows  ></description> </Issue>

So, this functionality should be disabled by default, as well.Currently, to change this behavior, one creates a `.sovrin/sovrin_config.py` file and adds the following line:{code}SendMonitorStats = False{code}" priority="4" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:14.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:34:43.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:34:43.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19761"/>

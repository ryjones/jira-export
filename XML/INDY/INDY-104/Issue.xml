CDATA # We should have a file extension on each file. # We should zero pad the files so the ordering is easier to deal with 000001, 000002, 000003 and so on. # Having all the files in one directory can also be an issue. We need to think about how this will look in 20 years of running. We should break up the files into sub-directories. Determining how many files to have in a given directory will also help determine how many digits to use in zero padding the files.  ></description> </Issue>

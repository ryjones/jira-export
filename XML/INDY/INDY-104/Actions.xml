CDATA Relevant comment from INDY-16:  {quote}  ~lovesh , I understand {{ls -1v *.log}} "fixes" this on Linux. However, in my opinion that's not a good enough reason to allow log files to interleave on a standard {{ls}} when zero padding fixes it on all operating systems.  Also, when I put my sysadmin's hat on, interleaved log files is just plain sloppy.  Plus, as mentioned before, zero padding will force us to actually consider how many transactions and files this system will have to realistically support. This will then allow us to make sure we have a plan to appropriately store the number of files and transactions across multiple operating systems and file system types.  Regarding the chunk size of 1000, several of us (including  ~danielhardman  and  ~krw910 ) were discussing this the other day. The small size makes sense if we are doing a sequential read of the files from a speed perspective. However, we could greatly speed the system up if we did the following:  * Each transaction file was accompanied by a lookup file. * Each lookup file would contain: ** The hash of the associated transaction file ** Fixed length records that recorded the byte offset for each record in the transaction file.  This would allow the following lookup process:  # Open the appropriate lookup file. # Seek to the appropriate record in the lookup file. # Read the byte offset for the record in the transaction file. # Close the lookup file. # Open the transaction file. # Seek to the appropriate record in the transaction file. # Read the transaction record. # Close the transaction file.  In cases where we wanted to do the sequential reads, we still could. We'd also have a known hash for each transaction file that could be quickly checked. It would also allow us to have far more than just 1000 records in the transaction file, which has a number of other benefits. {quote}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This item will be a document that explains the necessary instructions that a Steward would need to set up a validator node on the Sovrin network.  While initially running through the steps, it was realized that there are some steps within the process that for now will be added as placeholder values until decisions are made about the details of each of those portions of the instructions.  Place the document initially into a Google doc.  Initial draft due 5/30/17  Final draft due about 6/5/2017  ></description> </Issue>

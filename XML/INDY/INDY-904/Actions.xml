CDATA Looks like the ledger is too large to be fully synced using catchup. I tried to reproduced it on a local pool and found that it is time consuming even to start node with such a huge ledger. It takes ~4 minutes. Catchup failed too.  Quick workaround for this problem is just to copy domain ledger from other node. It is the most simple and quick way to solve it as of now.  Here is the new ticket https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-907   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Metis, a node on the ESN, has been experiencing difficulties since the network upgraded to 1.1.37.  As a "last resort" we removed the .sovrin/data directory to get the node to a reset state.  The node matches the version information of the other nodes on the network, and the services were down when we removed the directory.  The expectation was that the ledgers would sync when the sovrin-node service was brought back up.  The config ledger had been deleted on all nodes, so no sync was needed on that ledger.  The pool ledger synced normally.  But the domain ledger never synced, although it is evident in the logs that there was an attempt.  The domain genesis file contains 15 entries, and only these 15 entries ever appear on the ledger.  The other network validators have 43800 transactions on each.  This customer node has been down for 2 weeks now, and patience is gone.  ></description> </Issue>

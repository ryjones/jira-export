CDATA *Problem reason:*  Systems tests haven't been automated. Thus all of them have been performed manually by QA. The task should start process to automate that routine.  *Changes*: * updated jenkins library to support system tests handlers * added such a handler for indy-node which perform one of tests from the  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation  repo * system tests are run for both master and stable branches before GitHub tags releasing   *Committed into*:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1076  *Risk factors*:  Might brake the CD pipeline  *Risk*:  Low    *Covered with tests*:  no. Was tested manually with prepared test pipeline.   *Recommendations for QA*:  Nothing. According to pipeline runs after merge happened it works.  ></body> </Action>

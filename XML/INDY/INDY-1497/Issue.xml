CDATA If the remote (node) is not connected, we're trying to send it, but if re-connection will be needed (which means that the socket is re-created), the sent message will be lost.  This may be a cause of issues like the one found in the scope if INDY-1404 and INDY-1450 (when initial catchup can not be finished since some messages are not received).  ></description> </Issue>

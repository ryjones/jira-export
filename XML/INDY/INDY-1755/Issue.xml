CDATA  https://github.com/exonum/exonum   We need to find out how stable Exonum Implementation is. Timebox the effort to 4 engineering days.  Acceptance Criteria * Brief summary of findings evaluating for review by Richard, Nathan, Daniel, Jason, and the broader community. Discussion should include: ** Pros and Cons ** Characteristics of current deployments in production usage ** Current project roadmap ** Health of the open source community / level of investment ** Rough estimate of work required to bring Exonum to the same level as Plenum ** Rough understanding of performance ** Rough understanding of the difficulty of migrating from the existing Plenum to an implementation based on Exonum * A recommendation on whether to research more or kill the proposal * Put findings to  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-GuJuew1oUvnlzU7gBPZkF5Ongu92voojPHAPc-pUu8/edit#gid=1455070692   Things to consider: * Research how clients are authorized by ledger * How does this relate to work with observers * How much better is performance * How many nodes would be practical (50? 500? 5000?) * Get feedback from community * Notice: One of PoC goals should be smooth upgrade path * Notice: it would be great to be possible to make the client-to-node communication use A2A. We could even go one step further and do the same thing from node to node, though this might be harder.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

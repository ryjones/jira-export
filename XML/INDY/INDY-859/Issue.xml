CDATA As of now, we use and support only the multi-sig for the latest state.  We need to support multi-sig for historical states to be able to query historical data.  The multi-sig storage (key-value db) uses state root as a key, so it's pretty trivial to store sigs for all required old states.  We need to support some sort of catch-up for multi-sig storage. We need to send multi-sigs  for previous batches on timeout if we didn't send new batches.  ></description> </Issue>

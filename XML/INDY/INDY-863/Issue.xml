CDATA Some time ago a test was done where a new node was added to a pool that had 400,000 transactions. It took 2-3 days for that new node to catch up with the pool.  We need to retest this scenario by have a pool ledger of 400,000 transactions or more, then add a new node and see how long it takes for that node to catch up.  ></description> </Issue>

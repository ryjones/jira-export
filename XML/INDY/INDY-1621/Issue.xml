CDATA A steward with a node on the STN (version 1.3.62) is ready to have his node promoted to the live network. As a preliminary to this, his node must be demoted on the STN. Unfortunately this functionality, which we have used many times before, is not working this time. I have tried it with both the new (indy-cli) and the old (indy) cli's. Both give the same error: {code:java} pool(stn):wallet(stn_wallet):did(6fe...zSJ):indy> ledger node target=8Tqj57DbizpjWQCHvybtKNqKFgfw2bjJbPZrhHDoRoND alias=trustscience-validator01 services= Transaction has been rejected: existing data has conflicts with request data {'alias': 'trustscience-validator01', 'services':   } {code} {code:java} indy@sandbox> send NODE dest=8Tqj57DbizpjWQCHvybtKNqKFgfw2bjJbPZrhHDoRoND data={'alias': 'trustscience-validator01', 'services':   } Sending node request for node DID 8Tqj57DbizpjWQCHvybtKNqKFgfw2bjJbPZrhHDoRoND by 6feBTywcmJUriqqnGc1zSJ (request id: 1534888273867130) Node request failed with error: client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest("existing data has conflicts with request data {'alias': 'trustscience-validator01', 'services':   }",) {code} Attached is a log from one of the STN nodes, and the pool ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

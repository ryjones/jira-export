CDATA *This is very high priority, the BuilderNet is down until this can be fixed or worked around.*  _Environment_: BuilderNet shortly after upgrading to Sovrin 1.1.45 (indy-node version 1.8.0)  _Steps to Reproduce_:  # Upgraded BuilderNet to Sovrin 1.1.45 # All looked fine except 2 nodes did not upgrade properly. # When we manually upgraded the SYGNET1 node, things looked weird when trying to re-add it to the pool, so I performed a restart-pool of the entire network (between  approximately  18:15 and 18:45 UTC or log time) # Logs for journalctl of indy-node and indy-node-control, FoundationBuilder.log and read_ledger output for all ledgers, are attached.   _Expected Behavior_: No looping of restarts of nodes     _Observed Behavior_: Nodes are restarting every 30-50 seconds     _Notes_: When we added the SYGNET1 node last week, there was a problem where the node owner used a different alias to "init-indy-node" on his server than what was initially used to run "ledger node ..." to add it to the ledger.  This caused confusion on the ledger until we repaired it (or so we thought). The repair involved resending the initial init-indy-node command on the server and then he deleted 3 files with the wrong names from a directory.   ></description> </Issue>

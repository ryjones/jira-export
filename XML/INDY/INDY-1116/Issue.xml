CDATA We achieved 10 of 14 nodes active, with BLS keys configured on the live pool. However, when one of the remaining stewards attempted to add his BLS key to the ledger last night, the transaction would not post.  When  ~mgbailey  attempted to post a NYM or an update to his NODE, these would not post either.  I don't know if this is the same problem as INDY-1079, but it may be worth checking that first.  Since the live pool is once again down, this needs highest priority.   ></description> </Issue>

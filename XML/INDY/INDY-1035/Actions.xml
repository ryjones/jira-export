CDATA *Changes* Added static validation to not allow creation of a new Schema with the same NAME, VERSION and ORIGIN, so that a Schema with a given seq_no can be uniquely identified by a triple (NAME, VERSION, ORIGIN), and we can use seq_no or the triple for Schema identification.  *Risk* Low  *PR* https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/502  *Build* indy-node master 1.2.250  *Recommendation for QA* check that it's not possible to create a Schema with the same NAME and VERSION from CLI (try both Python and libindy CLI)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.250  Steps to Validate: 1. Try to add a Schema with the same NAME and VERSION by a single user. 2. Check that Schema from Step 1 can be added by another user (but also one time only).  Actual Results: Schema with the same NAME, VERSION and ORIGIN (issuer DID) parameters can't be added more than one time (both python and libindy CLi throws errors in this case).  Additional Info: Python CLI also throws one stacktrace line in addition to readable error `_ensureReqCompleted failed; not trying any more because 20 seconds have passed; args were (('XhYtvJqezMUKfF6KVNaGmT', 1513944915910751), 9hcpLr7br9Nw7tMudKSbKtdWpfdfSqFVjkDdpjjrcFVb, <function _submitData at 0x7f7b65f61f28>)` but it is not an issue since we have new libindy CLI.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Story* As a trustee of an Indy Network, the network should require other trustees to sign administrative transactions I want to sponsor so that I am confident that no single trustee can abuse the network.  *Acceptance Criteria* * All transactions that require a trustee role should require multiple trustee signatures. Specifically: ** Add a trustee ** Remove a trustee ** Add a steward ** Revoke the role of steward ** Demote a consensus node ** Send an upgrade transaction to the ledger * The number of signatures required should be specified on the configuration ledger * Create a Plan of Attack for how we would address this problem. * Create a HIPE describing how we want to handle trustee permissions. * Create an Epic and issues for doing the work.  *Notes* * In the future, it would be useful to specify the number of signatures as a ratio of total trustees, but this is not required for this story. (Depends on INDY-1594)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Result of analysis: * The load was more than the pool was able to process, so eventually it started to lagging behind and start a view change because of the latency * Some nodes started to re-order during view change, and, in particular, they re-ordered old PrePrepares for old requests (eventually with a noticable latency). Backups on the other hand started ordering new requests with pretty low latency. So, view changes continue to be triggered because of this.   Next Steps: * INDY-2299 is created to deal with this issue and avoid false positive view changes  Other issues found in logs: * `Identifier {} is not decoded into UTF-8 string` is logged somtimes.  ** SDK always sends identifiers in UTF-8 format ** So, either this is a bug in SDK (the identifier looks pretty short and suspicious), or something from node-to-node communication * `Commit message has invalid BLS signature` (see INDY-1932)   ></body> </Action>

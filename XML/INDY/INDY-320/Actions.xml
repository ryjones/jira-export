CDATA  ~lovesh  But if 2f+1 (n-f, or (n+f+2)/2, or whatever write consensus is) replicas think that PRE-PREPARE is correct, then we should be fine? We are waiting for COMMIT consensus in any case. We will not send PREPARE if the PRE_PREPARE is incorrect. Other valid nodes should also not send PREPARE.  And we send COMMIT only if we get a consensus of PREPAREs, so most of the replicas think that PREPREPARE is correct.  In other words, we're waiting for consensus of PREPAREs (that is we have a consensus that the PRE_PREPARE from Primary is valid). If only 1 malicious non-primary ignores it and sends PREPARE for incorrect PRE-PREPARE, then we still should be fine. We will not recieve >2f PREPARES in this case.   ></body> </Action>

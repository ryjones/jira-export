CDATA Stewards occasionally lose keys and need to re-provision their validator nodes. Currently they have to have a new steward DID in order to change their validator.  In the future, it is expected that stewards may have multiple nodes following the network, where one is a validator and the others are observers, and the steward can rotate between them.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We see three different use cases here: 1. Stewards should be able to update the Node entry and change their verkey. This is possible today and is tested. 2. Stewards should be able to swap in a new machine for their existing validator node. Currently, the suggested approach is to edit the Node transaction when the new machine is added, and edit the Node transaction again when the old machine is brought back. 3. Stewards should be able to have multiple Node transactions associated with their DID in order to allow hot-swapping a machine. We see the value to an operations team in having multiple Node transactions assigned per steward, but only one recognized as the validator. We'll evaluate when it is best to implement this functionality.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~esplinr  Has there been a change? This ticket is all about item #1, the ability of a steward to change his node DID (note that at some point engineering changed what they are calling it from node verkey to node DID). As far as I know, we are still unable to change this.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA A PR has been raised which changes dynamic validation on indy plenum to check for existing validator nodes, not just existing nodes. This allows a steward to have any number of nodes on a network, but only one of them may be promoted to Validator at any one time.     https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1486   ></body> </Action>

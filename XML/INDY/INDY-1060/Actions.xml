CDATA Regarding *Case 3*: There was a decision made a while back to have all hyperlinks use the {{stable}} branch. This was done because there were issues with {{master}}-based links being merged into {{stable}}, which then made it very difficult for anyone to actually use the documentation, as the community should be using the {{stable}} branch, as that is targeted to what they can easily download.  Relative links will work in some cases, but not all, especially if they are cross-repository.  So, I don't think *Case 3* is actually a bug.  ^^  ~krw910   ></body> </Action>

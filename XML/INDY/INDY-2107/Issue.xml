CDATA We have a steward on MainNet that had to upgrade manually after the automated upgrade failed on his node. Now when I inspect his status using validator-info, he is not in consensus, and he does not have an audit ledger:   {code:java} "atbsovrin": { "Node_info": { "Metrics": { "transaction-count": { "config": 7459, "ledger": 37976, "pool": 74 } } } }, {code}  Is there a plugin or something that should have been installed for this? He did run the migrate("1.6.83","1.7.1",10) python script. Please diagnose and give mitigation suggestions.  I am attaching the full validator-info for this node, and will request the logs from the manual upgrade session.  The automated upgrade had failed due to insufficient space in /boot, and is not the object of this ticket.  ></description> </Issue>

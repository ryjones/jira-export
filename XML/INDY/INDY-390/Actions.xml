CDATA Repo consolidation is done.  indy-node/0.4.17  indy-plenum/0.4.31  As a result we have two repos: plenum and indy-node. Each one of them produces a single deb package: python3-plenum and sovrin-node correspondingly.  BE AWARE, I stumbled upon intermittent issues with Jenkins several times (missing workspace). Eventually it disappeared, yet I feel obligated to inform you about it.  I tested final deliverable (DEB package) myself on a brand new VM. It installs and works just fine: cli starts, node starts.   ~danielhardman  at you request I packed our code in two DEB files: sovrin-node (includes indy-node, indy-client, indy-common) and python3-plenum (includes indy-plenum, indy-state, indy-ledger, indy-stp). Yet it feels odd to me that we bundle node and client together. Shouldn't we let our users work with the client alone? Shouldn't we still produce separate sovrin-node and sovrin-client DEB packages? If we decide to keep it bundled shouldn't we rename the package from sovrin-node to just sovrin (to avoid any confusion)? Anyway it can be done quick enough after the merge (I believe it's no more than a one day job). It's just something for you to think about.  Â   ></body> </Action>

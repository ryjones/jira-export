CDATA  I would like someone from Trev's organization ( ~mgbailey ,  ~tharmon , or  ~dfarns ), plus  ~rajesh.kalaria  and either  ~nage  or  ~TelegramSam  to buy off on this approach.  I have left some comments in the doc.  I recommend that the proposal be presented at the next Architects Roundtable–possibly with some attempt to get comments between now and then.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Here's my two cents, with a full understanding of what this may mean in terms of engineering time.  One of the purposes of this network is to provide permanent identities to disadvantaged populations. We can't simply disenfranchise members of that group because they aren't keeping their devices up to date (e.g., a refugee falls too far behind in updates on the 3000 mile overland crossing, and now can't access their identity).  So, I think Option 2 is the only real option.  {quote} Support all old versions of protocols in client (ugly?) {quote}  And yes, it's potentially really painful, though it needn't be ugly if we're careful how we architect it.  ></body> </Action>

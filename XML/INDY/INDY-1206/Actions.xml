CDATA Problem reason: - wrong count of backup replicas  Changes: - now, node would be joined only if node transaction was ordered (pool ledger is synced) or after completed catchup.  PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/627  Version: 1.3.353-master  Covered with test: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/plenum/test/primary_selection/test_add_node_with_f_changed.py  Recommendations for QA: 1. Set up pool of 7 nodes 2. Write about 40 transactions 3. One by one, add nodes 8-16 4. Check, that all nodes have expected count of replicas   ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.3.357 indy-plenum 1.2.299 libindy 1.3.1~441  *Steps to Validate:* 1. Set up the pool of 7 nodes. 2. Write about 40 transactions to the pool. 3. One by one, add nodes 8 - 16. (After each node adding check ledger size to make sure that catch up completed before adding next node.)  *Actual Results:* Pool is working. NYMs are written. All nodes have the same list of backup replicas  ></body> </Action>

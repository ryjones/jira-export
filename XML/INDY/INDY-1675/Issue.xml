CDATA Investigate restarting a pool under load: * Will it achieve consensus and begin processing transactions normally? * How long will this take?  We need to reproduce case: * pool was under load (load similar to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1639 decription in comments)  * make sure that few nodes slowed ordering (probably stress would help) * restart a pool * make a normal load ( ~20 txn/s)  Then, check if pool will start ordering and how soon will it happen  ></description> </Issue>

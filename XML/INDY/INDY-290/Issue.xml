CDATA We need to add some new functionality to the CLI so that we can test the transfer of an ID.   The suggested command would be "new key for ID xxxxxxx"  The scenario is that someone like a Trust Anchor creates an ID and puts it on the ledger without  a verification key. Now they want to give that ID to an owner and the owner needs to provide a verification key.  Today in the CLI with the way that wallets work you need to have the private key in the wallet of the new owner. The only way you can do that today is with the 'new key' command being run from the CLI on the target owners machine.  So in order for the target owner to take ownership of a key would be to generate that public private key pair on their machine.  To generate this new public and private key that is associated with the ID you would run 'new key for ID <identifier from Trust Anchor>' on from the target owners machine and then send the verkey to the Trust Anchor and have them run 'send NYM <ID> verkey=<the owners verkey>  ></description> </Issue>

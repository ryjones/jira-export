CDATA The steward made a mistake and did "init_bls_keys" as root instead of as the indy user. This resulted in a misconfiguration, with no bls data in the /var/lib/indy/live/keys/<ALIAS>/bls_keys folder. He then put the bls key data for that node into the ledger.  His pool ledger is now out of sync, lacking the last 2 transactions, including his own. I later got online with him to debug this. I discovered the error, and had him re-run the init_bls_keys as the indy user. The correct values are now in the /var/lib/indy/live/keys/<ALIAS>/bls_keys folder, matching what is on the ledger. However, his node will still not sync. I do not see responses to his pings in his logs, although in the ev1 logs it looks like our node is responding.  Logs are attached.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Described behavior was happened because of two reasons: 1. Old pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis file was used. (32-bytes identifiers were specified in signer ID.) This situation can be caused by using client with version before CID/DID changing. These changes were made before MGL, so we assume that real users will not be able to use such genesis file. 2. The pool and client have been working with invalid genesis file because catch up was not happened while starting client. Client and pool ledgers were compared by size and they had the same count of transactions. Comparison of hashes was not happened after that, so, client was able to work with pool using invalid genesis file until first catch up caused by changing of nodes count (adding/demotion/promotion). This problem was discussed with Nikita and Alex and we decided to create new ticket for this with lower priority.  ></body> </Action>

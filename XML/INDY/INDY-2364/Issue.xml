CDATA I have a question about indy pool  It seems that alice, faber, and acme used in the indy deme run in the same client.  However, I want to proceed with demo after creating as alice, faber, acme as different clients.  For example, alice is an android app, faber is a server with a db where student information is entered, and acme is a third party app.  In my opinion, do three clients need to connect to the same pool to do this?  So, how can different clients connect to the same pool?  If you simply make the pool configuration file and the domain configuration file the same and then create and access the pool, are they on the same indy network (ledger)?  ></description> </Issue>

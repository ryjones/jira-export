(This experiment does NOT need to demonstrate sustained performance of 10 trans per sec; it is okay if performance is degraded during brownouts. It also might be okay to see some loss of consensus that is NOT surprising, if a brownout is very severe--as long as consensus is restored after the brownout.)" priority="2" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-03-29 10:38:24.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:34:37.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:34:37.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="28977"/>

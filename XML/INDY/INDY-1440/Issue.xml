CDATA  pipenv|https://docs.pipenv.org/  seems as very promising and handy tool to make separated environment for python projects. It provides clean API and introduces lock file for python projects dependencies that should make python env more deterministic.  In particular it could act as a replacement for virtualenv (virtualenvwrapper): * for all indy projects to generate and manage lock files * in  one of base dockerfiles|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/baseimage/scripts/user.sh  for CI (where usage if virtualenv is implemented with some rough workarounds) * in  dev scripts|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/dev-setup/ubuntu  which setup dev environment  ></description> </Issue>

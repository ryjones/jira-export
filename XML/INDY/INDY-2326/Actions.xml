All of VC rounds were finished * problems with backup ordering were detected and it caused to failing by memory error * all nodes that had view no == 0 were not promoted because of test specific (random demotion and random promotion) * was created the ticket INDY-2334 regarding request processing on demoted node  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Comment, regarding to {code:java} Load test results with demotions/promotions once in 4000 seconds (2000 seconds promotion shift{code} * there was the same problem with slowly ordering on backups that caused to request queue increasing and memory failure then * all nodes that had view no == 0 were not promoted because of test specific (random demotion and random promotion) * also, 2000 seconds under load means, that demoted node can not to finish catchup process after promotion because it needs to catchup a lot of requests. Some of nodes was in this state. They didn't order but always tried to catchup.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Comments, regarding to {code:java} Load test results with demotions/promotions once in 1800 seconds (180 seconds promotion shift) with 1/10 of production load rate {code} * this test looks much better. We had predictable circles of demotion/promotion * there was a problem with slow backup ordering, but it was not too critical as in previous tests * as in previous tests, nodes with view_no == 0 was demoted but not promoted back.     ></body> </Action>

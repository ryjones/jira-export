<Action id="54026" issue="27956" author="benjsmi" type="comment" body="I have had a recent experience with this, where my validator node took about 10-15 minutes to get caught up to the current state of the ledger. At what point does 10-15 minutes turn into several days?  Is there a cutoff point before which we just accept that the ledger is truth?" created="2018-11-29 20:18:08.0" updateauthor="benjsmi" updated="2018-11-29 20:18:08.0"/>

CDATA Recent releases contain a lot of improvements to the catch-up.

We will include it in our conversations about a future ledger architecture.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Summary* Currently when view change takes too long instance change is sent only once. However due to discarding old instance change messages (>2 hours old) this can sometimes lead to failure to start a view change. This already has happened on BuilderNet (see  INDY-2133)  *Acceptance criteria* * implement periodic sending of instance changes * cover by tests  ></description> </Issue>

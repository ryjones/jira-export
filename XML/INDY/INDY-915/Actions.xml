CDATA Case1: the reason is an error in init_bls_keys script (wrong config was used). It's fixed in the PR above.  Case2, Case 2.1: the reason is that 1) We have warning level of logs in client, which is shown in CLI 2) There is no timeout in CLI when receiving a reply, so in cases 2 we are waiting for the correct reply forever (logging to stdout the reason of the issue: incorrect BLS sigs).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA PRs:  - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/427 - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/417  Build: 1.2.180  The fix just reduces log level, so that we don't have these message shown in the logs. In case of incorrect signatures, CLI will just don't return anything (like currently we don't return anything if don't have a quorum). We can create a ticket for better error processing (I think with low priority since we're going to get rid of this CLI).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.182 Messages are not shown for all cases: - Keys are not configured, signature is absent - Keys are configured, signature is invalid - Keys are configured, signature is valid.  Additionally, following case was verified (test that signature validation works on client side): 1. Setup the pool with vonfigured BLS keys.  2. Change blskeys in CLI genesis file.  3. Run the CLI. 4. Try to GET NYM.  => GET_NYM worked correctly because of quorum.  5. Turn off services on n-1 nodes. 6. Try to GET_NYM.  => GET_NYM didn't return result because of difference between keys in CLI genesis file and in pool ledger.

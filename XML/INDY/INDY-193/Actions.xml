CDATA In the case described in the ticket only one node has detected that the master's primary is malicious and so blacklisted it because only that node was one which performed catch-up while the only suspicion on the master's primary was corrupted transactions being sent in CATCHUP_REP message. However, this suspicious behavior itself does not affect the ability of the master's primary to participate in processing and ordering of new transactions. Later when more nodes go through catch-ups and blacklist the master's primary, at some moment the monitoring mechanism will detect degradation of the master instance performance comparing to the backup instances (in the utmost case it will happen when f+1 nodes blacklist the master's primary and thus processing of new transactions halts).  To trigger view change at the moment when the master's primary is blacklisted the first time we need to introduce notifying other nodes about some node is blacklisted and a mechanism of requesting known transactions from other node for verification only. Such the fix seems to be rather time-consuming while the issue seems not to be critical because blacklisting of some node by other nodes one by one during their catch-ups will eventually cause a view change. So I propose to schedule this work for the time after Minimal Go-Live.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~danielhardman  As follows from Nikita's comment, the situation described in the ticket is not an issue, but rather expected behaviour as of now. So, no changes/tests were implemented. There is a way how we can improve this behaviour (the second paragraph of Nikita's comment), but it looks quite minor.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~danielhardman , modification of the current behavior that would take place in scope of this ticket seems to be rather time-consuming while the issue seems not to be critical. Please see my comment above for the details. So must we schedule this work for the time after Minimal Go-Live?  ></body> </Action>

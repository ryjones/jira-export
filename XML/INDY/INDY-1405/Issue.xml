CDATA In  INDY-1350|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1350  and  INDY-1400|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1400  it was found that next big problem with view change is that it can interrupt catchup process, leaving partially catched up state which leads to problems with applying batches that contain some transactions that were received through catch up.  Proper fix looks like enabling correct handling of this case. Also, this is a prerequisite for implementing PBFT view change:  INDY-1335|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1335   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Consider this somewhat likely scenario:  There is an initial pool of 10 (called 1-10) validators.  Over time, an additional 5 (11-15) are added. Now say that #9 is deleted, and #7 is updated, so a new genesis file is created to reflect this.  Now add an additional validator.  On the first 15, which used the original genesis file, the ledger will be:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 9 deletion 7 update 16  On the new node, assuming that the genesis file has the #9 deletion and the #7 update and none of the new nodes are added, what will it be?  This might be be the new genesis file:  1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 7 update  Will the catchup be smart enough to recognize the different ordering?  The missing entry for #9?  That it already has the update for #7?  Are we at all concerned that even if the catchup works properly, the ledger for this node will not match the others entry-by-entry?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Number of logs and size of artifacts lead to lack of free space on jenkins server. We have set some limits for number of days and number of jobs to keep but it's a temporary solution and we will have to decrease the limits very soon. Moreover it's not a good idea at all because for some branches/jobs it's better to keep as long history as possible.  Currently we have the following sizes for jenkins jobs:  {code:java} /var/lib/jenkins/jobs$ du -sb * | sort -nr  45829779230     Evernym Agency  17070585160     agency  12410592367     Indy SDK CI  5526072100      Indy SDK CD  4502267867      agency-integrationtests  710663519       Indy-Plenum  531781791       Indy-Node  183536093       Indy Crypto CD  64074962        Indy-Anoncreds  49378018        Indy Crypto CI  47050675        indy-node-verify-x86_64_copy  45924950        Sovrin  18217297        Test  ... {code}     Options: # extrenal storage for all or some pipelines ** explore options how and where to store logs and especially artifacts outside the jenkins server machine ** re-configure Jenkins or/and pipelines # review and fix pipelines that produce most heavy logs/artifacts  ></description> </Issue>

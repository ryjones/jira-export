CDATA I tested master repo as well - the same behavior.  However if I used following command to install client {code:java} pip install sovrin-client-dev{code} I do not have a crash.  So probably the issue connected with deb packets.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA the issue was caused by promt-toolkit package. ubuntu 16.04 has promt-toolkit v0.57 but ubuntu 17.04 has v1.0.9.  it looks like these versions handles None values different ways. I replaced None values with empty containers so now the client does not crash on start  however I suggest to test all the client usecases and compare the output and behavior.     plenum a3538766b0f84241d2bccb5a548f599d4c580aba  does not have any automated tests  ></body> </Action>

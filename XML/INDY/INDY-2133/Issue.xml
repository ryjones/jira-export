CDATA _Environment_: BuilderNet (indy-node 1.8.0)  _Steps to Reproduce_: When the BuilderNet failed last week, we had everyone run a script (see issue indy-2128).  All but one node ran the script, so we decided to have everyone restart.  The restart process was gradual, but when I came in to work this morning (16:00  UTC) there were enough nodes for consensus, but they were reporting as not in consensus.  After a short time I tried a restart and that seemed to fix the issue.  See attached logs.  _Expected Behavior_: Nodes achieve consensus without a restart of all nodes.  _Observed Behavior_: The Nodes did not come into consensus on their own. _Notes_:  ~sergey.khoroshavin   has output in RC from my monitoring script that shows some of the above mentioned behaviors. He suggested that I enter this ticket and include logs from before the weekend (Start looking at date 2019-06-07) until today (2019-06-10 ~1700 UTC).  See attached log or logs.  ></description> </Issue>

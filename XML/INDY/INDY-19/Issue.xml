CDATA *We found this issue from looking into SOV-966* The nodes blacklisted each other either after a certain number of transactions (12,000) or from getting to many simultaneous requests. I was sending between 500 and 2,000 at once from 1 to 4 machines.  *Steps:* It was a collection of transactions over time. I was using 1 client sending 500 requests at once from 4 different machines when I think it all went down (so 2,000 simultaneous transactions).    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Need to: * improve system tests reduce running time (especially for *TestAuditSuite.py* and *TestAuthMapSuite.py*), options: ** replace unnecessary delays with eventually based waiters (currently there a lot of delays based on "sleep" with quite big sleeping periods) ** split test modules into parts * makes tokens related tests optional, options ** move all tokes tests to separate modules ** use some conditional flag to skip those tests * review and organize *test_misc.py*  Acceptance criteria: # each test module should need not more that a half an hour # there should be a possibility to run mixed tests modules without tokens related testsÂ   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Systemd is the standard control bug for daemons and long-running background processes in Ubuntu, to be sure.  However, as we move forward, folks may want to run their validators in Docker containers. Systemd is unavailable in Docker.  Instead, many who write Docker images but want to provide on/off and management capabilities to the services inside their Docker containers use  Supervisor|https://supervisord.org .  There are others, of course, such as launchd.  The point of this task/issue is to remove hard-coded instances of OS/shell-out calls to systemd and replace them with an abstraction that would allow pluggable interfacing with whichever process control management system may be appropriate for the determined environment.  ></description> </Issue>

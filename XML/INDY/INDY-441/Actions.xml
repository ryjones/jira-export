CDATA  ~ozheregelya  I am abandoning this ticket, i do see on the 2 new nodes that the new nodes raised a suspicion on for the PRE-PREPARE having incorrect state trie root but i could not reproduce this, i am going to commit an automated test for this behaviour. Also the log files contain only info and above log levels. But the biggest reason for abandoning this ticket is this kind of line in the logs of both new nodes. {code} Node5:0 reverting 1 txns and state root from b"\xdf\xee\x92{dz\xea\xb9\xcd\x86n~\x04T\xa4B\xd2\xe0\xa3}2$\xdd\x02\xb25.\xae\t\x1e'\xb8" to b'\xac\xfd_\xe0\x05\xf3WB\xfa\xc5\xce`U>\xe7\xa8\xb9\x15F\x11\x8d\xff\xa0\x18^\xf7g\xa3\x01M\xe6\x98' for ledger 1 {code} Above is from Node5. This means that before this PRE-PREPARE the state root of node was `b'\xac\xfd_\xe0\x05\xf3WB\xfa\xc5\xce`U>\xe7\xa8\xb9\x15F\x11\x8d\xff\xa0\x18^\xf7g\xa3\x01M\xe6\x98` which is `CeHDAVUNU3vdv9KPuYJcMyLapAdQfeRcVWWgWMZq1ukB` in base58. But if you check in the logs, no previous PRE-PREPARE had state root as `CeHDAVUNU3vdv9KPuYJcMyLapAdQfeRcVWWgWMZq1ukB`. In the fact the revert should have happened to `2tDdU58Ra4WLTznbmsTmJxedzqMDXw67xFL7qWx6yh7M` which is the previous PRE-PREPARE for ledger 1 and i don't see any indication of something being written to ledger or state before the transaction since catchup had already completed. So i am assuming the node was not started from a correct state (some wrong genesis file copied). I think we should start including state roots in catchup messages (LEDGER_STATUS, CONS_PROOF) so these problems can be caught earlier.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Current implementation of the _auth_map_ structure does not support multi-signature quorums for actions. In order to support such functionality we need to modify and extend it to implement the rules like:  _<action>:  <who can do this>: <required number of signatures> _ i.e. _<action1>:  <role1>: <quorum1>, <role2>: <quorum2> _  Of course the format may be different, it's just a concept.  ></description> </Issue>

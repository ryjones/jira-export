CDATA Hi,  I am new to Indy and I am trying to understand better the structure of the whole system. I understand what is a Trustee, Steward and Trust Anchor.  I was reading the 'indy-plenum/plenum/common/test_network_setup.py' script and I saw this piece of code  Â  {code:python|borderStyle=solid} for cd in client_defs: txn = Member.nym_txn(cd.nym, verkey=cd.verkey, creator=trustee_def.nym, seq_no=seq_no, protocol_version=genesis_protocol_version) {code} What are these clients for ? what can they do ?  Thanks in advance for your answer !  ></description> </Issue>

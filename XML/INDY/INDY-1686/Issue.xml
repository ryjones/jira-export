CDATA As of now we limit ZMQ message queues, but this limit is per-connection (there is a queue for every connection)  *Acceptance criteria:* - create tests (can be without Plenum, just isolated one based on ZMQ) emulating SDK client load more than server can process ** for example 40 requests per sec from client, and 20 reads per sec by listener ** client need to create a new connection for every 5 requests ** create tests for Python and C implementation of ZMQ - compare memory consumption ** compare Python and C ** analyse how ZMQ deals with a lot of connection (how it reads requests, and releases queues for each connections) ** check if and when memory is released once load is stopped. - check how Monitor affect memory consumption  Compare memory usage in each case  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA There is a PoC that satisfies most important requirements: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/979 However there is still a lot of room for improvement: * molecule integration tests were not updated to check that instances are created in different regions * molecule integration tests use boto, migration to boto3 is highly recommended * module integration tests are dirty (they don't delete test security groups during teardown) * there is no support for creating spot instances * different groups in same namespace create separate inventory dirs (having one inventory dir per namespace would be highly preferrable) * aws_manage role doesn't register nodes in in-memory inventory (which prevents combining aws_manage and pool_install in one playbook) * AMI search criteria is hardcoded (it uses latest Ubuntu 16.04 image from Canonical) * there is no support for scaling existing instance types (for example from small to large and back) * some of documentation is not up to date  ></body> </Action>

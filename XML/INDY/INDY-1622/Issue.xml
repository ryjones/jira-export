CDATA Additional requirements: - groups should be named - instances of group should be created in different AWS regions - there should be easy way to generate ssh config to access instances in pool - there should be easy way to access all instances in group as a whole using Ansible  There are two major options how this can be implemented: 1. Tool that creates pool should outputs ssh config and ansible inventory file that could be used to access group instances without requiring access to AWS API. 2. Tool that creates pool just tags instances somehow, so Ansible dynamic or in-memory inventory could be used, which can be easier for further automation.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~ryjones  created new CloudStack template which includes indy docker image:   https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/packer/provision/docker.sh#L116   All indy projects now require new Jenkins agents labels "hyp-x-indy" ( https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management/blob/master/jjb/indy/indy-macros.yaml#L19 ) which is pointed to mentioned new CloudStack template (https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/configure-readonly/).     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem reason: - ci pipelines spent a lot of time to build docker images because docker images layers not included ones needed by indy ci docker containers  Changes: - baseimage for indy docker containers was added to docker cache on the CloudStack machines    Risk factors: - Nothing is expected.  Risk: - Low  Recommendations for QA: do the following sequence of steps * trigger a build for any indy project PR adding "test this please" comment * check on  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/indy/  that a job was triggered and docker builds based on "hyperledger/indy-core-baseci:0.0.1" use local docker cache  ></body> </Action>

Trigger a build for any indy project PR adding "test this please" comment. 2. Check on https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/indy/ that a job was triggered and docker builds based on "hyperledger/indy-core-baseci:0.0.1" use local docker cache.  Actual Results: Docker builds based on "hyperledger/indy-core-baseci:0.0.1" use local docker cache (there are no "Pulling fs layer..." entries for indy-core-baseci in new ci jobs).  ></body> </Action>

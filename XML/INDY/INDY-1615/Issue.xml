CDATA Consider other BFT-based algorithms which can be better than RBFT. Timebox the effort to 3 engineering days.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Brief summary of findings evaluating the top alternatives to RBFT for review by Richard, Nathan, Daniel, Jason, and the broader community. * Each alternative should cover ** Characteristics of current implementations of the protocol in production usage ** Pros and Cons ** Rough estimate of work required * Current recommendations (given the limited research done to date)  ></description> </Issue>

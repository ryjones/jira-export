CDATA Currently release versions of indy-node looks like semver but actually doesn't follow it having build numbers as patch part of the version.Â   Requirements: * 3rd number of the version should have a real patch meaning (follow semver) * versions of different branches of the code should be clearly related * indy-node should be easily linked to indy-plenum version for both dev and stable code * there should be clear relation between artifacts and code  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Acceptance criteria:* - The client should be a fat binary - consider writing in Rust with dependencies statically linked - provide manually built packages for Ubuntu18.04 and Windows 10 - The client binary needs to output whether there is a ZMQ connection  - Client should work against a given Validator Node (through the client stack)  *Notes* * Automated CI / CD is not required. Manual builds from a developer machine is sufficient. ** Builds for Centos 8 would be nice, but are not required. ** We do not expect to need Mac builds. * We do not need a fat binary for the server-side tool. ** If we need additional work on the server-side tool, it will be to have the docker file setup the service. * It is optional to work against the server-side script in addition to the validator node.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Hi Daniel  I have gone through the Oscap docs,got fair idea of what it does and installed Workbench as part of it on Windows . Is there a way to connect without loading key file here? !workbench.png|thumbnail!  which if I proceed asking for a key pass for which if I give "yes" as input is failing to connect to remote host. !pass-key.png|thumbnail!   Also I tried to do the same from CLI, but somehow missing an option.    ></body> </Action>

CDATA It looks to me like you've tried to connect to a fresh ubuntu instance on amazon; these instances usually have sshd configured to require a private key to connect (so, ssh -i <keyfile> ubuntu@xyz). Instead, try scanning an ubuntu server that has sshd configured to accept password-based login.  Alternatively, you could ssh to a server using putty or a similar client, and then run the oscap command-line tool instead of trying to use the gui. Is this what you meant when you said you tried the same from the CLI?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="23370" issue="16167" author="lsc" type="comment" body="I had the same issue where the workbench didn&apos;t allow me to login as i already enabled 2FA and SSH key access to the server. So i had to download and use the oscap-ssh tool and modified the shell script to scan my machine with 2FA (Google Authenticator) and SSH key authentication. Otherwise as Daniel said - use a vanilla Ubuntu box with normal plain password authentication." created="2017-05-04 07:39:54.0" updateauthor="lsc" updated="2017-05-04 07:39:54.0"/>

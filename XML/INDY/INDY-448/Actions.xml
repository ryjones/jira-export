CDATA  ~stevetolman ,  ~devin-fisher ,  ~danielhardman ,  ~krw910  As far as I understand, logic with cryptonyms was deprecated, but user is still able to create 32-byte identifier (e.g. using command "new identifier W6CUN1QHTpYa2HxxJ7aRP4aLfi8cx8AJ6cFvY9pv85A" or something like this), send NYM still support sending 32-byte identifiers and 32-byte identifier are still present in help (e.g. "help send NYM"). Is it ok?   ~ashcherbakov , FYI.  ></body> </Action>

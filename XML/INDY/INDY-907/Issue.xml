CDATA If there is a large domain ledger and you add one new node to the pool you risk to fail because catch-up cannot complete. New node sends catchup requests, but gets no replies from the pool.  Such a situation is described in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-904   Furthermore it would probably be good to think out another mechanism for such cases.  Like usage of torrent protocol or something similar.  ></description> </Issue>

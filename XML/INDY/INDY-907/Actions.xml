CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.1.171  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install a pool of 4 nodes. 2. Write 100k NYMs via load_test.py script. 3. Stop the 4th node and delete .sovrin/data/ folder. 4. Start the 4th node.  Actual Results: The 4th node catched up 536 entries out of 100k. There is an info in log about discarding CATCHUP_REP message because it contains duplicates or gaps.  ^_node1.txt    ^_node2.txt    ^_node3.txt    ^Node4.log.tar.gz    Expexted Results: The 4th node should catch up successfully.  Additional Info: There is at least one duplicated NYM entry in the ledger that was added manually (but there should be no issues with catch up of duplicate entries because this is a normal case). !duplicate_NYM.PNG|thumbnail!  Although small ledger (18 txns) with 3 duplicated entries catches up successfully in this case. Also the 4th node doesn't catch up after restart.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Pool started a lot of view changes one by one. It leaded to "out of memory" in all nodes. Firstly the problem reason with view changes was a long catchup on some nodes: * 4 view change - nodes 11, 12, 16, 24, 3, 8 * 5 view change - nodes 15, 17 * 6 view change - nodes 14, 9, 4 * 7 view change - nodes 14, 15, 4. 9  Via high load they spend more time for processing messages from queues, it leads to queue increase because nodes re-ask messages that wait processing in queues. Secondly this nodes sent instance changes and with the bug INDY-1555Â nodes have a master degraded and starts new view.  This is the expected behavior under this high load conditions.  ></body> </Action>

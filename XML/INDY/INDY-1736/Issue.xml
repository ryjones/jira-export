But some nodes (*Node3, Node11, Node13, Node15, Node24, Node25*) were performing this view change for a long time, completed it later than other nodes (at 21:19 - 21:21) and *were not participating in ordering* after this. *The diagram* *attached* *to the previous comment is from Node13*, so the ordering on it stopped on the view change beginning at 21:13.{quote}  Logs and metrics: s3://qanodelogs/INDY-1607-Ext-26-09-18-mix  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Try to avoid re-serialization (de-serialization of serialized data and re-serialization again) in all places. * Consider using the serialized data from client as-is. De-serialize it just for analysing, but use the initial (serialized by client) version to put it into the ledger (transactions log and hash store). * Consider using serialized data from other nodes during catch-up as is.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA PoA:  Places with ledger.getAllTxn()  calls with should be changed for faster way: * getNodeServices should be redefined. New method should be cashing nodes services. Use new field from INDY-1879. * Cashing self node id in pool manager (Can dest be changes?). It fixes problem with using rank.  Validator info uses getAllTxn too. But it happens every minute and it's not so often.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA There are also the following places which should also be handled: * *TxnStackManager.getNodesServices - on every pool upgrade??? we should use state instead* * TxnStackManager._parse_pool_transaction_file  - we should use stat instead * TxnStackManager.nodeExistsInLedger - can be removed * TxnStackManager.nodeIds - looks like it's used in tests only? * Plenum's DomainReqHandler.countStewards - looks like isn't used in indy-node (overriden) - should remove then? * *Node.addGenesisNyms - iterates through the whole Domain ledger during each restart of the node!!!!* * *Node.collectNodeInfo - on every view change and restart!!!!* * pool_manager.id * *IndyNode: NodeAuthNr - on every upgrade???* * *IndyNode: PoolConfig.processLedger - after every catch up!!!!*  ></body> </Action>

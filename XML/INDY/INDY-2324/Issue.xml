CDATA *Rationale* We discovered a bunch of edge cases related to promotion/demotion combined with view change (for example INDY-2308, INDY-2320, INDY-2322). Despite that we have a plan of attack for fixing these problems it is still quite alarming that these cases were caught by intermittent failures of system-level tests, and were completely uncaught by simulation tests. In order to be sure that these problems are really fixed (and improve general confidence in current implementation) we need to make sure these edge cases are reliably caught in simulation tests.  *Acceptance criteria* Make sure these edge cases are captured in simulation tests. If improved simulation tests uncover more edge cases that cannot be fixed fast - create follow-up tickets.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Problem reason:  - because the set of multi-signatures in request can differ consensus in old libindy versions was not collected  Changes:  - moved `multi_signature` to `state_proof`  PR: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1356   Version: - indy-node master 1.10.0~dev1095 - indy-sdk master 1.11.1~1343  Risk factors: - some state proof corner cases  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1356/files#diff-25d6b0f795369aa431667e42226f8392R11  Recommendations for QA - test state proof on old version, test that requests on the versions with old changes that they are collected properly.  ></body> </Action>

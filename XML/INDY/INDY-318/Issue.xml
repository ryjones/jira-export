CDATA The running time of the plenum tests is around 1 hour. So the approximated build history for the PR-224 looks like: * build #1: an error because of the changes in the PR * build #2: an intermittent error – test_primary_election_case6 * build #3: all tests are passed * build #4: an intermittent error – testNodeDoesNotParticipateUntilCaughtUp (is triggered by changes in the master) * build #5: all tests are passed  Total build time is around 6 hours.    *The scope:* # Speed up the tests ** find why a certain test is slow and speed up it # Keep the test suite running time under some certain time. Thirty minutes is a great target.  ** terminating the whole test suite after the defined time (sounds coarse but otherwise #1 is our permanent task) # Some tests do not pass in pycharm but does pass in CI's runner.py (in sovrin-client testAgentCliHelp, testAgentCliForInvalidCommand, ...) # Intermittent tests ** create a CI pipeline which will continuously build master branch in order to find intermittent tests # Sometimes a test fails only on CI and a developer have to wait until whole test suit is passed. It takes tens minutes. ** if it is possible CI should output errors as soon as it possible, a developer should not have to wait tens minutes until build finishes.  # Run the tests in parallel ** could we use *xdist*?  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently BLS signature is created against the Ledger the 3PC batch is created for. If there are FEEs coming with the txn, then Token Ledger will be signed as well, so we create and verify BLS multi-sig twice for every COMMIT in case of FEEs used.   This was done to avoid expensive breaking changes. However, we can do just one BLS signature if we sign over Audit Ledger.  *Acceptnce Criteria* * Design how BLS multi-signature can de done over Audit Ledger * Consider changes on both Node and SDK sides * Consider how to deal with this breaking change (increment Protocol Version) * Consider how to migrate existing BLS data and stores  ></description> </Issue>

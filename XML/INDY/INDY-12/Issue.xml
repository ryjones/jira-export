The only solution as of now is to restart the node. This needs to be fixed, we have CHECKPOINT in the code which is sent periodically, as of now it only helps in garbage collection. It should be used as opportunity to start a catch up process node come to a start where it can start processing new requests again." priority="1" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-05-24 20:51:07.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:36:59.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:36:59.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="17081"/>

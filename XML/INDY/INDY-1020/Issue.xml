This method is used when node keys are generated using the scripts {{scripts/init_indy_keys}} or {{scripts/init_bls_keys}}. The method {{init_bls_keys}} is passed a 32 byte seed intended to be used for generating ed25519 keypair. This can be fixed in several ways, HKDF can be used on the 32 byte seed or rather than expecting/generating 32 bytes of seed, expect/generate 48 bytes of seed which are good for creating BLS keys but discard the first or last 16 bytes of the seed and use for ed25519 keypair generation" priority="3" resolution="10001" status="10001" created="2017-12-06 22:10:14.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:35:45.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:35:45.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="24841"/>

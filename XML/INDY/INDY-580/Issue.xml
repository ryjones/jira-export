CDATA POA: - Use _python setup.py bdist_rpm_ to create RPMs out of python packages - Create RPM packages for system dependencies like libsodium, etc. - Create a repo for RPMs (for stable, release candidates and dev, similar to how it's done for deb packages) - A script to publish to the repositories (stable, rc, dev) - Extend CI pipelines to include build and publishing step.  Notes: I think we could  re-useSahs's work on DEBs|https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-packaging  with some alterations. Have a look at  Releases and CD pipelines architecture and Guides|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gKf3F_r7WamoIYS_-ts2nruB2VIuiIpjmzPIVNf2VK0/edit   ></description> </Issue>

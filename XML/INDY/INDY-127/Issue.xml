CDATA Client version: 0.3.113  OS/Platform: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS  ></environment> <description><! CDATA    *Case 1* Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create new keyring named "oz2". => It becomes active and it is saved to _/home/agent/.sovrin/keyrings/no-env_. Note that this keyring is in Un-persisted wallets. 2. Create new keyring named "oz3". => It becomes active and it is saved to _/home/agent/.sovrin/keyrings/no-env_. Note that this keyring is in Un-persisted wallets, and oz2 keyring moves to Persisted wallets. 3. Connect to test. => oz3 is active and it is moved to _/home/agent/.sovrin/keyrings/test_ 3. Run command _new key with seed 000000000000000000000000Steward1_ 4. Run command _disconnect_  Actual Results: Active keyring is changed to oz2 after disconnect. \{code} sovrin@test> disconnect Disconnecting from test ... Active keyring "oz3" saved (/home/agent/.sovrin/keyrings/test/oz3.wallet) Disconnected from test  Saved keyring "oz2" restored (/home/agent/.sovrin/keyrings/no-env/oz2.wallet) Active keyring set to "oz2" \{code}  Expected Results: Active keyring should not be changed.

CDATA This failure looks like it may be related to  https://evernym.atlassian.net/browse/EN-755,  so it is valuable to diagnose even though it is in the old cli. Older versions of indy-node like 1.3.X were able to handle the case where a node in the genesis file were not available.  The catch-up in the old cli would time out and pool data updates would be requested from another node. This does not appear to happen correctly in newer versions such as 1.5.515.  In this case if a node is unreachable by a client, the pool is not updated, and the following is repeatedly printed to the terminal: {code:java} 9uwBGTkFRnh9h3VkDKtVnESKTmTgHLjFzWXyWL3WjuvS reconnecting to danubeC:HA(host='128.130.204.35', port='9722') 9uwBGTkFRnh9h3VkDKtVnESKTmTgHLjFzWXyWL3WjuvS reconnecting to danubeC:HA(host='128.130.204.35', port='9722') 9uwBGTkFRnh9h3VkDKtVnESKTmTgHLjFzWXyWL3WjuvS reconnecting to danubeC:HA(host='128.130.204.35', port='9722') ...{code} The pool catch-up does not occur.  cli logs are attached.  ></description> </Issue>

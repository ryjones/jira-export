<Action id="49493" issue="33085" author="mgbailey" type="comment" body="This is the old indy-node based cli. However I am concerned that it may reflect on catch-up more generally, where there is a genesis node that is not reachable." created="2018-08-28 15:00:52.0" updateauthor="mgbailey" updated="2018-08-28 15:00:52.0"/>

CDATA I believe Old CLI is already deprecated. Can we recommend moving to the new (libindy-based) CLI? Will it solve the issue?   ~esplinr   ~mgbailey   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem reason: * Problem that is happening in the attached log caused by using indy-node older than 1.3.446 and using updated client  * That is because updated client support protocolVersion filed in LEDGER_STATUS message and old indy-nod not. So that you can't catchup with this client  Solution: * For newer node use updated client * For elder node use downgraded client     ></body> </Action>

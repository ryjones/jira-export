CDATA pyzmq needs to be updated to the latest version (we use 17.0.0 but the latest version is 18.1.0)  In particular, ZMQ needs to be updated because of the following reasons: *  https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.2.4:  fix race condition with ZMQ_LINGER socket option (looks similar to the issues we see) *  https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2:  a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected. Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!  ></description> </Issue>

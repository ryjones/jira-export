CDATA *PoA*: # add tasks to perform *ssh-keyscan* which would add host keys to: ** _aws_inventory_dir/.ssh/known_hosts_: to make an inventory portable to other environments ** (option 1) _~/.ssh/known_host_s: to skip ssh host checks in pool_install.yml playbook ** (options 2) use ssh option _UserKnownHostsFile=aws_inventory_dir/.ssh/known_hosts_ # if option 1 is the choice: use _ssh-keygen -R_ to remove keys at tear-down phase # (optionally) check how it works for docker/vagrant and turn off ssh hosts checks if needed  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Problem reason*: * aws provisioned hosts keys were unknown for ssh clients and required user interaction during first attempt to reach them breaking automated workflow of Ansible scripts  *Changes*: * added logic of scanning hosts for their ssh keys and putting them to custom known_hosts file * ansible ssh connections were pointed to that known_hosts file  *Committed into*:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1029   *Risk factors*:  Nothing is expected.   *Risk*:  Low    *Covered with tests*:  no, tested manually   *Recommendations for QA*: * since QA for doesn't have ability to run aws related routine no validation from them are expected * was tested by me and  ~sergey.khoroshavin  using our accounts on AWS  ></body> </Action>

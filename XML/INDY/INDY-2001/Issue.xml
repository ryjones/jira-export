CDATA See INDY-1732 for details  *Acceptance criteria* * It should be possible to have constraints for every rule in config ledger * Rules (keys in auth map) are static and can not be changed by the user; only the constraints are configurable. So, rule_id can be a key in the state, and constraint be the value * If there is no constraint for the rule in the config ledger, then default (local) value should be used. Initially all constraints are local. * Correctly serialize/deserialize constraints (json?) in a proper format * Cover by tests  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA This ticket is a follow-up to INDY-193.  In that ticket's comment stream,  ~spivachuk  identified some follow-up work that could be done to make us more robust. Here is what he said:  "To trigger view change at the moment when the master's primary is blacklisted the first time we need to introduce notifying other nodes about some node is blacklisted and a mechanism of requesting known transactions from other node for verification only. Such the fix seems to be rather time-consuming while the issue seems not to be critical because blacklisting of some node by other nodes one by one during their catch-ups will eventually cause a view change. So I propose to schedule this work for the time after Minimal Go-Live."  This ticket is to track that work.  ></description> </Issue>

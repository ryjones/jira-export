CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * Tests should be implemented which show that if some request doesn't get ordered for long enough for some reason then view change starts and successfully completes * Broadcasting INSTANCE_CHANGE when some request is stuck for long enough should be implemented * Threshold timeout should be configurable, and it should be possible to turn off this functionality * Extensive testing should be performed to make sure that this won't provoke perpetual view change under high enough load  *Additional notes* * This will make sure that if more than _f_ and less than _n-f_ nodes enter view change then if (and as soon as) there are any incoming write requests then remaining nodes that are not yet in view change will also enter view change allowing it to finish * In other words it should reliably fix problem occured in INDY-1903 * Also this is basically what original PBFT (not RBFT) paper requires * This will also provide pretty good resistance to censorship attacks * However there is a high risk that this change can provoke perpetual view change under high enough load, so extensive testing is required, as well as probably some more research. Implementation of INDY-1863 _might_ also help here   ></description> </Issue>

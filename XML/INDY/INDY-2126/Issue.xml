CDATA Currently we use  https://hub.docker.com/r/teracy/ubuntu/tags Â as base image for our dind client which seems quite solid (50K+ pulls) but we should more closer look on it: is it safe to use it for our build pipelines.  As of now there is no official docker dind image based on ubuntu:16.04.  Options: # continue to use it # switch to another more trusted base image # grab the idea of the dind client inside docker container and build out own image based on ubuntu:16.04 (optionally and preferable: push to docker registry).

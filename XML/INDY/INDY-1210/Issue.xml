CDATA All cases have been reproduced in Docker with 7 nodes X = node3, Y = node6  *Steps to reproduce:* 1. Write some NYMs 2. Disconnect node which follows the primary instance 2 (nodeY) 3. Disconnect current primary (nodeX) 4. Try to write some NYMs 5. Connect nodeY back 6. Connect nodeX back  *Expected results:* - nodeY returned back to pool successfully - viewChange completed successfully when (n-f+1) node returned back - nodeX returned back to pool successfully  *Actual results:* - pool lost its quorum and cannot restore it - all nodes (exclude X and Y) assume that X and Y are malicious - nodeX cannot connect to all the others  ></description> </Issue>

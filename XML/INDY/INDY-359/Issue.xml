CDATA We have multiple places where we call `ledger.getAllTxn()` and iterate through them. It's very inefficient for a huge production ledger (especially domain one).  We need to make sure that we don't call getAllTxn() for Domain ledger. It's also not good to call it for pool and config ledgers, but not as critical as for domain one.

CDATA I went through Test Scenario 07 and Test Scenario 09 as described in the description and cli.log_couldnotauthenticate a couple times and didn't get any errors.   Also cannot reproduce in tests.  If the issue is reproduced again attaching /home/sovrin/.sovrin folder may help.  For now moving in "to test" stage.    ></body> </Action>

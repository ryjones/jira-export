CDATA Obviously we'd want to provide security around this, but it gets somewhat cumbersome to have to exec or ssh into my node to run the validator-info command just to check to see what's going on.Â  I've heard there was a discussion around making the indy-cli (I'm guessing the SDK-based CLI here) capable of querying node status... and that this feature would be included in libindy, so therefore accessible to any and all apps.  But I think any Steward, in order to setup monitoring, PagerDuty, support, etc, is going to want to be able to quickly and easily get the status (FULL status) of their Node without having to rely on SSH or other methods.  ></description> </Issue>

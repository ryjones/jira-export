CDATA  ~mgbailey , our issues with getting the indy-cli version of this working notwithstanding, it would not satisfy this issue as far as I'm concerned.  In my view, there would be a publicly accessible port beside the validator's client port that would HTTP access that would return a JSON rendering of the contents of validator-info, minus any info you think might be too useful to an attacker. Status though, at minimum, seems like something we shouldn't need to resort to compiling our own SDK to get at though.  EvenÂ *better* would be if I could browse to that Node's IP and see a HTML dashboard that gave me a "prettier" rendering of the info in validator-info.  ></body> </Action>

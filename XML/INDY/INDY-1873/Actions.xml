CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.700  Steps to Validate: 1. Start a pool of 7 nodes. 2. Send some write requests. 3. Ensure that the batches are ordered in the instances 1 and 2. 4. Stop the primary of the instance 2 (3rd node). 5. Stop the master's primary (1st node). 6. Wait for a view change is started and completed. 7. Start the last stopped node (1st node). 8. Start the first stopped node (3rd node) and ensure that it is the primary of the instance 1 now. 9. Send some write requests. 10. Verify that the new batches are ordered in the instances 0 and 2 and there is *no 1 instance* at any node.  Actual Results: All batches are ordered successfully for 0 and 2 instances. There is no 1 instance at any node after Step 9. !INDY-1873.PNG|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

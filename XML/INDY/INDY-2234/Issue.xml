CDATA We do have nightly system tests against the current version on indy-node and the current version of libindy.  We need to test compatibility between the current indy-node and old versions of libindy.  *Acceptance criteria* * Configure CD pipeline to run nightly test against previous stable version of libindy * It doesn't need to be done every night, so find out a proper frequency (twice per week?) * Do the changes (tagging?) in tests if needed to not run tests that doesn't make sense for old version (new feature not supported by the old libindy).  ></description> </Issue>

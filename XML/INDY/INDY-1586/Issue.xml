CDATA QA Engineers testing the ledger (i.e. Chaos experiments, system tests, etc.), Support Engineers troubleshooting ledger issues, and software engineers developing applications for Trustees and Stewards (i.e. ledger pool dashboard, diagnostic tools for operations) would benefit from having a node's "services" included in validator-info output.  The Chaos experiments being developed for indy-node provides sample code for reading a node's "services" from the pool ledger:  https://github.com/evernym/chaosindy/blob/master/chaosindy/ledger_interaction.py#L111-L243  It is recommended that the validator-info verbose json output (`validator-info -v --json`) include a node's services state (i.e. "", " OBSERVER ", or " VALIDATOR "). Perhaps under "Node_info"? I would sort of expect "Mode" to be sufficient to indicate if a node's services are "VALIDATOR" (i.e. "participating"), "OBSERVER" (i.e. "observing"), "" (i.e. "blacklisted"), or something like that. Not sure if I am using the term "blacklisted" correctly in this context.  ></description> </Issue>

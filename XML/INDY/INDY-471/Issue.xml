CDATA Executing the TestGetTxnRequestWorksForInvalidSeqNo in GetTxnRequestTest after TestClaimDefRequestWorks in ClaimDefRequestTest from the .NET test suite causes the node pool to crash.    I'm not clear on what specifically is triggering the crash but have narrowed it down to the code in these two tests: the first test sets up the condition that causes the failure while the second fails when calling indy_submit_request with the following value:  \{"reqId":1501340745244981900,"identifier":"V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f","operation":\{"type":"3","data":27}}  If the first test is not run the second will not cause the failure in the pool.  Although this may be caused by an issue in the .NET tests themselves (I'm not seeing the same problem in the Java tests) it seemed prudent to raise the issue as it appears to demonstrate a problem that can be triggered in the node pool via the indy-sdk.  Please see the attached console output from the nodes.  Note that the indy-pool.dockerfile is being used to run the indy pool, although the IP address has been changed to 127.0.0.1.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA h6. BUILD  sovrin-node 1.8.2 (but problem also occurs in usual master builds) sovrin-client 0.4.20 h6. STEPS TO REPRODUCE # Send POOL_UPGRADE command specifying time xx.yy, xx.yy+5, xx.yy+10, ... in _schedule_ section. => Message about successful upgrade in CLI. # Send POOL_UPGRADE command specifying time xx-1.yy, xx-1.yy+5, ... in _schedule_ section (but it still should be valid time, so xx-1.yy > current time).  h6. ACTUAL RESULT * Message about successful upgrade in CLI but in fact this upgrade will be ignored. * When xx-1.yy time comes upgrade won't be applied. * _upgrade_log_ doesn't contain any information about this upgrade. * I couldn't found information about upgrade in _Node<number>.log_ and _journalctl.log_  h6. EXPECTED RESULT Appropriate error message in CLI which helps to understand that upgrade will be ignored.  ></description> </Issue>

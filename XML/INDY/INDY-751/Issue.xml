CDATA - PRE-PREPARE: Primary sends sig for the current batch (and multi-sig for the previous one?) - PREPARE: Non-primaries (verify multi-sig for the previous batch?) and send a sig for the current one - COMMIT: send COMMIT only if we have n-f correct sigs from different nodes - Support multi-sig verification on timeout (without a real batch)?? - Having the logic on master instance only we make the difference between master and backups even more dramatic, so it may lead to incorrect view changes   ></description> </Issue>

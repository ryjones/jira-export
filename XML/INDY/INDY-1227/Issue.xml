CDATA Many people in Community tries using indy-running-locally script from indy-node to start the pool.  But this script is not intended way to start the pool.  We need to find out how to help Community to avoid confusion.  As an option, we can  1) remove all references to indy-running-locally from main documentation (README)  2) Have a bold warning in this script that it should not be used and Docker/Vagrant are appropriate options.  3) Mention Docker-based solution from libindy repo to start the pool locally in README.  ></description> </Issue>

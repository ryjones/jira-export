I have tried this with indy-cli versions 1.6.6 and 1.6.7, but I think the problem is in the node code, not the cli. The rejection message is showing up in the node logs, one of which I have attached.  We have 4 new stewards trying to onboard right now, and multiple are running into this problem.  ></description> </Issue>

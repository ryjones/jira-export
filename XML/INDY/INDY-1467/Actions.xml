CDATA *Problem state / reason:*  See ticket description.  *Changes:*  Removed peersWithoutRemotes class member, changed several class methods that used peersWithoutRemotes, fixed tests that relied on push notification about changed pool membership.  *Committed into:*      https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/808     https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/817     indy-node 1.4.503-master  *Risk factors:*      Deprecated client will not receive push notification about changed pool membership from nodes.     May be some side effects related to propagated request, but probability is very low.  *Risk:*      Medium  *Recommendations for QA:*  Do load testing and check whether something strange happens.  ></body> </Action>

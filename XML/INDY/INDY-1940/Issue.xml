CDATA The debug response from validator-info should show the individual consensus status of each node. {code} Node 1 got votes from: 2, 4, 15 {code}  A compact view on the default response could also show the consensus status: {code} Node 1  .X.X..........X.........  {code} Which shows that there were votes from node 2, 4, and 15 and no votes from nodes the other nodes 1 through 24.

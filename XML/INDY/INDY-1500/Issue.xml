CDATA *Story* As an administrator of a node on an Indy Network, I want the upgrade transaction to specify my network specific package rather than generic Indy Node so that my network specific package can perform configuration and customization functions such as installing network specific plugins to the Plenum Ledger.  *Acceptance Criteria* * The Node upgrade script should use that value to call the platform specific package manager (on Debian will be apt) to install or update the package. Enhance node_control_tool to update the specified package, not IndyNode (see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_node/utils/node_control_tool.py and https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/scripts/upgrade_indy_node_ubuntu1604.sh)  *Notes* * The work to have the upgrade transaction include a value containing the package that should be upgraded is in INDY-1499 * The Sovrin network wants their network upgrades to call the Sovrin package instead of Indy Node. The Sovrin package depends on Indy Node. * There will be a new release of the Sovrin network package with each release of Indy Node.  ></description> </Issue>

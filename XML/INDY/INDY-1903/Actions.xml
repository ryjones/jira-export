CDATA Investigation of log files from _ev1_ node showed the following: * ordering was performed on all instances except 3 and 5 until 2018-12-08 05:24:43 * 05:25:37: first INSTANCE_CHANGE(viewNo: 3, reason: 26) messages started to appear signaling that nodes lost connection to master primary * 05:25:54: _ev1_ also lost connection to master primary (which was _danube_) * 05:25:56: first message requests of LEDGER_STATUS started to appear, which could be indication that some nodes started view change with following catch up * 05:25:56: _ev1_ also decided to send INSTANCE_CHANGE(viewNo: 3, reason: 26), but quorum still wasn't reached * 05:25:57: first VIEW_CHANGE_DONE(viewNo: 3, name 'royal_sovrin') messages started to appear signaling that nodes are trying to finish view change * 05:26:00: there was single INSTANCE_CHANGE(viewNo: 4, reason: 26) from _iRespond_, which means that _iRespond_ lost connection to new master primary which is _royal_sovrin_ * 05:26:12: connection to _danube_ was reestablished, and _danube_ was seemingly restored to have viewNo 2 * 05:29:43: request from client was received (seems like it was monitoring ATTRIB transaction), and there was attempt to order it in view 2, but quorum wasn't reached * 05:32:56: INSTANCE_CHANGE(viewNo: 4, reason: 28) messages started to appear signaling that nodes that started view change to view 3 were not able to finish it (most probably due to lack of quorum of VIEW_CHANGE_DONE messages) and trying to move to next view, but quorum wasn't reached * after that nothing happened except periodic failed attempts to order incoming requests  Seems like there are *24* active validator nodes, so *f=7* and *n-f=17* Before view change 3PC consensus messages were coming from all nodes. Instance change request to view 3 was received from following 15 nodes (16 if counting _ev1_, *1 less than needed to reach quorum*): * Aalto * amihan-sovrin (18 seconds earlier than others) * atbsovrin * BIGAWSUSEAST1-001 * digitalbazaar (18 seconds earlier than others) * DustStorm * ibm * icenode * NewtonD (18 seconds earlier than others) * prosovitor (simultaneous with ledger status request) * ServerVS * Stuard * TNO * VeridiumIDC * zaValidator  Ledger status requests and view change done messages were received from following nodes 16 nodes (*1 less than needed to reach quorum*): * Aalto * atbsovrin * BIGAWSUSEAST1-001 * digitalbazaar * esatus_AG * findentity * icenode * iRespond (later than others, simultaneous with IC(4, 26)) * OASFCU * pcValidator01 * prosovitor * royal_sovrin * ServerVS * Stuard * trustscience-validator02 * VeridiumIDC  When trying to order new incoming requests following 7 (8 if counting _ev1_) nodes were sending 3PC consensus messages related to view 2 (so they were definitely not in view change): * amihan-sovrin * danube * DustStorm * ibm * NewtonD * TNO * zaValidator   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Analysis of logs from *danube* showed that it was indeed a short network outage and not a restart, as originally thought. Also not all connections were disrupted long enough, so just 16 nodes (which is less than _n-f_) should have sent INSTANCE_CHANGE(3, 26), which *correlates with previous observations*. {code}

CDATA  ~peacekeeper  Well, actually this was caused by different events that were happening throughout 3 weeks period (more precisely 2018-11-16 17:27 UTC till 2018-12-08 05:25 UTC), and last network outage was just a final trigger for the incident. Also from my point of view incident happened not because *danube* was somewhat misbehaving (on purpose or not), but because there is a serious shortcoming in current protocol implementation that was there from the very beginning, and it was just a big misfortune that it was uncovered only now and in such unpleasant circumstances. More information can be found in already posted  incident report|https://forum.sovrin.org/t/sovrin-main-net-outage-december-2018/1010 , and I'm going to add some more details here soon.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Conclusion* There is serious protocol shortcoming which allows situations where less than _n-f_ nodes enter view change, basically bringing pool into read-only state until manual emergency restart of all nodes. *Steps to reproduce* basically boils down to following: # Given working pool # Make randomly selected half of nodes broadcast INSTANCE_CHANGE (for example, by selectively limiting their connectivity to primary node) # Restart another randomly selected set of half nodes (but not including current master primary) # Make another half of nodes that were not selected in (2) to broadcast INSTANCE_CHANGE messages # This will lead to nodes that were not restarted in (3) to enter a view change, with their number not enough to finish it # At the same time number of remaining nodes that didn't enter a view change will be not enough to continue normal request processing # So pool is non operational until manual restart of all nodes  The problem is basically the same as found in INDY-1893.  There are several possible *options to fix this*: * Discard old INSTANCE_CHANGE messages on some predefined timeout. It won't fix issue, just reduce probability of running into this problem, but it can be done really quickly. This will be addressed in INDY-1909. * Introduce some unique _ID_ into INSTANCE_CHANGE messages and come up with a way to assign it in a way that will prevent this problem altogether. It's not yet known whether such protocol exists and if it is really simple to implement, but research (which includes writing tests for checking different hypothesis) is already ongoing and results will be provided in INDY-1897 * As per original PBFT paper (not an RBFT, on which Indy Plenum is based) nodes should start view change when they detect that some transactions are not ordered for long enough time. While it can be quickly implemented almost as is and it will definitely fix this issue it will make pool much more susceptible to DDoS. This will be addressed in INDY-1910. * Following previous idea, if INDY-933 gets implemented nodes can vote for view change if state doesn't get updated long enough. I believe this option is actually the most robust solution in the long run, however it will take some time to implement it. Also it increases probability of view change, and given that Indy Plenum has problems (INDY-1296 and all related issues) with current implementation it introduces additional risks until these problems get fixed. This will be addressed in INDY-1911.   ></body> </Action>

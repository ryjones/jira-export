CDATA This is a issue analyzed as part of INDY-27, copied the following comment from that ticket    {code:java} My understanding is a new Validator cannot just be added to the system. Only a Steward can approve addition of a new Validator to the system. Without which a new node will not have the keys to establisy a ED25519 encrypted session with the pool This defect is still a definite possiblility but to be able to do that a already trusted Validator needs to be compromized first and then the python code on the Validator needs to be patched so that it can carry out a DOS attack on other NODES It is also possibel that the process of vetting the Steward is compromised in either case we need to find a solution to this problem {code}    Possible solution to the problem suggested by Lovesh in the original ticket is to implement some kind of thresold based throttling.  But this issue needs deeper analysis, If we at all go to implement throttling we need to do this based on a adaptive threshold  Also we might want to consider developing a Anomaly detect system that feeds into a adaptive threshold maybe        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Change reason:  - The previous version of spike script did not allow a user to configure gradual load.  Changes:  - Added a possibility to provide initial and final rate, time of one step. Additional load rate per step is calculated automatically. - Added a possibility to see the configured load profile before execution, for this purpose the script should be launched with -g=True argument.    PR: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/935   Version: - master, build 626  Risk factors: - Some configurations may lead to not desired load rate, please check graph before load testing in complicated cases.  Risk: - Low  Recommendations for QA Configurations which will raise errors: * Final load rate less than initial load rate * Difference between initial and final load rate divided to test/spike time should not be less than 1.  ></body> </Action>

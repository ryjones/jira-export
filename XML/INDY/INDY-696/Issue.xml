CDATA Example: https://ci.evernym.com/job/Plenum/view/change-requests/job/PR-320/3/console  Problem cause: * The test was running more than 100 seconds (default limit for tests) - this is the issue by itself, we have a separate ticket for this. * `pytest.fail` was called: `indy-plenum/plenum/test/conftest.py`, line 109. * The tests on CI are executed by https://github.com/evernym/jenkins-shared/blob/master/resources/runner.py * If `runner.py` sees that a test existed with non-zero code, but there were no error/failures (like in the situation above), it logs the output and exists (doesn't call other tests): https://github.com/evernym/jenkins-shared/blob/master/resources/runner.py#L60   ></description> </Issue>

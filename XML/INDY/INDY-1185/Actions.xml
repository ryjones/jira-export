CDATA Investigated and fixed tests: - test_new_primary_has_wrong_clock: problem: view change was sometimes happening in unexpected place solution: delayed instance change messages until safe moment - test_node_catchup_after_restart_with_txns problem: nodes became synchronized too fast solution: increased delay of catchup reply messages - testProtocolInstanceCannotBecomeActiveWithLessThanFourServers problem: not enough time for nodes to synchronize when added back to pool solution: increased allowed time to synchronize - test_successive_batch_do_no_change_state problem: unexpected view change was sometimes happening solution: disabled all instance change message  Remaining suspicious tests: - test_6th_node_join_after_view_change_by_master_restart - test_new_node_accepts_chosen_primary - test_quorum_after_f_plus_2_nodes_including_primary_turned_off_and_later_on - test_old_non_primary_restart_after_view_change (failed once in Evernym CI)  ></body> </Action>

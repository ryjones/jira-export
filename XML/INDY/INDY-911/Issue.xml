CDATA I have a 7 node pool. I have an additional 5 machines setup running libindy with some performance generating scripts.  On each of the 5 machines the script runs 200 threads sending 30 transactions each one at a time. So across the 5 machines I am sending 1,000 transactions at a time.  The pool received and processed about 8 transactions and then stopped taking any new transactions. I stopped the scripts and tried from the CLI which also failed to add a new transaction.  The pool functioned properly after restarting the nodes.  Each node in the pool shows the same error in its log at about the same time. *{color:#d04437}commit failed for batch request, error IndexError('list index out of range'{color}*  I have seen this error before under a load less than 1,000 at a time.   I am including only a portion of one of the logs since their size is too big to attach. I have all 7 logs (223 MB) if anyone needs me to send them.  ></description> </Issue>

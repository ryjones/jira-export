CDATA Problem reason: - The issue with warnings about that a node is trying to commit a batch with a particular state root but no uncommitted found was caused by a missed call of {{Node.onBatchCreated}} method on re-applying a batch prior to ordering before ledgers synchronization in case the batch was rejected previously due to catch-up start. This resulted in absence of the batch in {{IdrCache.uncommitted}} list when the batch was being ordered by the node. - The issue with warnings about {{IndexError}} was revealed by the previous one and caused by a missed {{return}} statement in {{IdrCache.onBatchCommitted}} method.  Problem state: - Both the issues were fixed in scope of INDY-960.  ></body> </Action>

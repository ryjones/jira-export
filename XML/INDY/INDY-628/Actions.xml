CDATA PoA: 1) Support Observer and Observable Interface 2) Make Node implement or have an implementation of this Interface 3) Be able to register Observers  3) Define enum with Observer Policy (have just one item for now: EACH_BATCH) 4) Support Strategy pattern for Observers and propagation of state 5) Propagate state according to the Observer Policy type (for now just support EACH_BATCH) 6) Make Observers process Sata based on the Policy (EACH_BATCH only for now)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Changes*  - Abstract Observer Support (based on strategies/policies) - Abstract Observable Support (based on strategies/policies) - Implemented Observable strategy to propagate each committed Batch to all Observers - Implemented Observer strategy to apply each committed Batch - Each Node has Observer and Observable instances - Communication between Observer/Observable and Nodes is done via messages (BatchCommitted, ObservedData). This is done to simplify future re-factoring for State Machine and Actors Model. - added required tests  *PR* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/487  *Covered by Test* - test/plenum/observers (both unit and integration tests for all entities and communications)  *Risk factor* - Low, as this will not be really used until we register real observers  *Recommendation for QA* - As it doesn't affect existing workflow (and tests prove that base functionality works), I think the story can be closed after PR is reviewed and merged.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In the case that a transaction is sent to the validator pool via CLI or otherwise, and is unable to be posted to the ledger, all nodes in the pool should log the failure to post as an ERROR, including an explanation of why the ledger was unable to post the transaction.  For example, if consensus was not achieved, list the nodes that were able to participate, and which were not.  This posting may occur after a short timeout period, if necessary.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Provisional network shows 12/14 nodes are connected, and the ledgers are synced on at least 11 of them, and maybe on 12 (see INDY-1219).  Still, NYM transactions sent to the ledger are not being posted.  Why is this happening?  Which nodes are not participating in consensus? Logs are attached. The CLI output where a send NYM was attempted is also attached. {code:java} mikebailey@sao-sov-p001:~$ sudo validator-info -v  sudo  password for mikebailey: Validator ev1 is running Current time: Monday, March 12, 2018 5:26:42 PM Validator DID: GWgp6huggos5HrzHVDy5xeBkYHxPvrRZzjPNAyJAqpjA Verification Key: 46HnJNoJCRdFasFSBakSyqSgNGE93STk7wZiddJnsCfLgMKWjhWEJNc Node Port: 9701/tcp on 0.0.0.0/0 Client Port: 9702/tcp on 0.0.0.0/0 Metrics: Uptime: 6 days, 20 hours, 7 minutes, 7 seconds Total Config Transactions: 114 Total Ledger Transactions: 43 Total Pool Transactions: 33 Read Transactions/Seconds: 0.00 Write Transactions/Seconds: 0.00 Reachable Hosts: 12/14 BIGAWSUSEAST1-001 DustStorm OASFCU ServerVS danube digitalbazaar esatus_AG ev1 iRespond prosovitor royal_sovrin zaValidator Unreachable Hosts: 2/14 thoth icenode Software Versions: indy-node: 1.2.50 sovrin: 1.1.6 {code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA PoA: - Add pool_root_hash to multi-sig (so that MultiSig consists of three values: multi-sig; participants (node names); pool_root_hash) - Sign not only domain_root_hash, but concatenation of domain_root_hash and pool_root_hash (so that verifier knows that the pool state is valid) - Store pool_root_hash in multi-sig storage (that is store all three values). - When verifying, get the pool state according to the provided pool_root_hash, and get the BLS keys corresponded to that state. - Send both domain_root_hash and pool_root_hash in PrePrepare (multi-sig) and use correct values for verification of multi-sig    ></body> </Action>

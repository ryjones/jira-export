CDATA We have better throughput (*~10%* for first 25k written txn) and lesser amount of failed txns (up to *1k* max failed from first 50k written vs up to *100* max failed from first 50k written) at this parameters:  {noformat} DELTA = 0.1 LAMBDA = 240 OMEGA = 20  Max3PCBatchSize = 10000 (100000) Max3PCBatchWait = 1 {noformat}  Also there are inconsistent results for ZMQ queue size exploration so additional investigation against AWS pool is needed.  ></body> </Action>

So, *some of the nodes may not to be upgraded during simultaneous pool-upgrade*. If this problem will appear, stewards should perform manual upgrade of indy-node in accordance with this instruction:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUvbioL5OsmZMSkwRcu0p0jdttJO5VS8K3GhDLdNaoI  (!) To reduce the risk of reproducing INDY-1447, it is *recommended to use old CLI for pool upgrade*.  (!) *Pool upgrade from indy-node 1.3.62 should be performed simultaneously for all nodes due to txn format changes.* (!) *All indy-cli pools should be recreated with actual genesis files.* (i) *For more details about txn format changes see INDY-1421.*  ></description> </Issue>

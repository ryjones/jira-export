CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.565 _view change is disabled in all cases_  Actual Results: *25/25 nodes are up:* We sustain *~20* NYM writes per second throughput and have low latency *(2~4)* during all test run. RAM consumption is *up to 600 MB* at the end of test run. *Over 100k* NYMs are written for 2 hours. !ALL_UP.png|thumbnail!   *1..4 backup primaries are down:* Throughput is degraded *from ~20 to ~0* at the end of test run (clients get 307 from pool) and latency grows continiously during all test run *from ~0 to 40~60*. RAM consumption is *up to 1.5 GB* at the end of test run. *Less than 30k* NYMs are written for 1.5 hours. !BACKUP_DOWN.png|thumbnail!   All this trends are confirmed by shutting down instance 1 primary under load: !BACKUP_DOWN_UNDER_LOAD.png|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

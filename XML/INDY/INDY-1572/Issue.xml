CDATA There is a high chance of memory leaks if one of the (non-master) primaries is stopped.  The corresponding instance will not be able to order, and requests will not be cleared till the next view change.  *Acceptance criteria*:  Perform the following tests and report results about memory consumption with memory checks enabled (in particular, the checks for memory usage of our internal queues and structures). * Disable view change. Stop a primary on 1 backup instance. Run load of 10 writes per second. * Disable view change. Stop a primary on multiple backup instances. Run load of 10 writes per second.  ></description> </Issue>

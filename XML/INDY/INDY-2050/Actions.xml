CDATA *Problem 1:* In the method __is_next_pre_prepare we check a Pre-Prepare message without initial validation. We removed the logic error from this method. This is valid because the message verification is done further. *Problem 2:* 1,22 nodes stopped ordering.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem reason/description:  - If there were some missing PrePrepares (so that a node received, for example, PrePrepares with ppSeqNo=2 and ppSeqNo=4, but didn't receive ppSeqNo=3), then during view change a Node may try process the lag, and raise a LogicError in this case, which looks incorrect, since this situation is expected.  Changes:  - do not raise logic error anymore  PR: - fix:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1167  - test: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1175  Version: - Plenum 1.7.0.dev761  Risk factors: - View change  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - `test_missing_pp_before_starting_vc`  Recommendations for QA - it's hard to reproduce it in Load, so integration test should be enough - make sure that there are no such errors in next load tests  ></body> </Action>

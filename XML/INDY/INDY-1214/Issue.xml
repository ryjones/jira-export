CDATA In the provisional network, a steward had a node that other nodes were unable to connect to, in spite of validator-info indicating that the node was operating normally.  There were no signs of problems in his indy logs, other than there being no new logs being written at all. He restarted the indy-node service with no improvement.  The only sign of the problem was in journalctl, which is attached.  After a lot of searching and not finding the problem, it was resolved when we again stopped the service to increase the log level verbosity.  When we brought the service back up, it resumed normal operation.  Please examine the attached journalctl stack trace, and see if there is an exception that could have been caught or other remediation that can be done to prevent this in the future.  ></description> </Issue>

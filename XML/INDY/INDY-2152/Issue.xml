CDATA New system tests that are coming would be quite slow and seems their duration unlikely can be changed drastically. Thus, they should be added to CD pipeline conditionally: * It is not desirable to increase duration of the master CD pipeline since it would increase the load of the CI server * it must have for release process  Acceptance criteria: * system tests for master are run partly (only some base and selective checks that are valuable) * system tests for rc and stable are run completely  ></description> </Issue>

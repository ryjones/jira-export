CDATA Under high load when requests are received faster than they are ordered _monitor.requestOrdered_ starts taking significant portion of time, which leads to even slower ordering. This should be fixed.   There is a place in the monitor where we have quadratic asymptotic for 3PC batch size because we iterate twice.  We need to fix this, which can give us a benefit in performance, especially in case of DDoS where we may have huge 3PC batches.  ></description> </Issue>

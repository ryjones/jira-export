CDATA The task reflects recent discussion with Daniel about the list of things that should be presented in projects. Need to use strict dependencies instead of omitted ('latest') ones.  * Acceptance Criteria*  * List the dependencies than need pinning * For each dependency, briefly evaluate whether the project has traditionally broken during minor upgrades ** Review previous release notes ** Review our previous experience depending on the package * Make a proposal for how to pin ** Weigh the QA risk of floating packages ** Compare with the risk of us missing a service pack security fix or breaking when ported to other platforms (Fedora) ** Get approval from Daniel * Implement the change * If a dependency currently has an upgrade available or that will be available soon, create an issue for testing the upgrade.  *Notes* * We are pinning to the currently known working versions. Upgrading the packages is not required. * We don't want to pin packages used exclusively for testing. They don't impact QA, and we can pin them later if they cause a build breakage and fixing them is too big of a burden. * We are guessing that Node has less than 3 dependencies.  ></description> </Issue>

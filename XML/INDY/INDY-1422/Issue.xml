CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.4.463 libindy 1.4.0~565  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 25 nodes with following parameters in config:    {code:java} DELTA = 0.1 LAMBDA = 240 OMEGA = 20 Max3PCBatchSize = 10000 Max3PCBatchWait = 1  {code} 2. Run the load test: {code:java} python3.5 perf_processes.py -n 1 -t 1 -c 10 -r 100 -g perf25_transactions_genesis{code} *Actual Results:* Pool have wrote ~975K txs during several days. First View Change was happened on ~950K txs due to primary node failure because of out of memory. After that one more view change was happened and `incorrect state trie` appeared on part of nodes. But nodes with `incorrect state trie` were continued txns ordering.  ></description> </Issue>

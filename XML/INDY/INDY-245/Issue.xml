CDATA *Steps:* # have a 4-nodes pool, all nodes are running # stop one node # send ATTRIB txn  *Result:*  The pool does not return replays  *Expected result:*  The pool returns replays     *Finding:* * Node2 did not forward the request 1497408485465294 to the replicas after the node gets 2 propagates from node3 and node4 * so 3pc is stopped because no quorum (node1 is not participating) * the pool sends ppSeqNo=1 in a CONSISTENCY_PROOF replay to node1 after the node1 is started * but next pre-prepare comes with ppSeqNo=4 from the primary * so node1 prints "_missing PRE-PREPAREs between 4 and 1"_  * PROPAGATE for 1497408485465294 comes to node3 and node4 before node3 and node4 receive 1497408485465294 from client           ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The POOL_UPGRADE transaction has a required parameter for a sha256 hash. However the hash is not being used to validate the build being installed. Any hash will apparently fulfill the parameter.  Â Please propose a change to either allow this hash to work across platforms. If not cross platform please propose another method to validate the upgrade is installing the correct version (we expect to support multiple platforms in the future)(far future we may have different instances of the code that implement the same version of the protocol).  ></description> </Issue>

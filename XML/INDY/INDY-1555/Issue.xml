CDATA As of now, monitor is reset when view change starts, so there can be more ViewChanges because of degradation, as ViewChange may take up to 5 mins, and degradation may be detected for 4 mins.  Â   *Acceptance criteria:* * Add tests that no degradation can be detected during the view change * Reset monitor when view change ends (add unit tests for this) * Do not send InstanceChange because of degradation during view change (add unit tests for this)  ></description> </Issue>

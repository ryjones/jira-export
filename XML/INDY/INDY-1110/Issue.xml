CDATA I have been trying to set up a demo for about a week now using the indy getting started and setup dev pages, and have had no luck.  The demo says pip install indy-client  Can't do that.  Tried the whole dev setup thing and got lots of errors.  Running on redhat Linux  Looking to set up demo to get company interested in this product.  Would appreciate some help  Thanks,  Rich Levinson  Oracle        ></description> </Issue>

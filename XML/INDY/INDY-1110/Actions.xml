CDATA I have resolved the problem by giving up on Linux, and instead doing the whole thing: VirtualBox, Vagrant, Git, etc. on Windows 10 and got thru it in the better part of a day.  Using the link to the "Setting Up a Test Indy Network in VMs"     https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/stable/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md   and doing everything on W10 enabled me to get thru the whole demo.  The demo was worth the effort.     ></body> </Action>

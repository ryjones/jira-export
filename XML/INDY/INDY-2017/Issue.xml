CDATA Observed behavior: When a new node called sparcnz was added to the MainNet (v. 1.6.82), it was unable to contact the first node in the genesis file (ev1). In spite of this, it selected ev1 as the first primary. This is in spite of the fact that all other nodes in the pool had selected danube as the primary.  After fixing the firewall rule that was preventing a connection to ev1, sparcnz immediately did a view change and selected danube as the first primary.  Expected behavior: The behavior should have been that sparcnz would select danube as the primary (matching the other validators), in spite of it not being able to contact the first node in the genesis file.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Steps to reproduce: Send NYM transaction to the STN ledger through indy sdk with enabled logs.  Expected result: Receive ACK/REPLAY from all nodes (except icenode may be)  Actual result: Attached files: 1) log_stn_nym_4_m is filtered copy of log_stn_nym_4. The most strange is last responses: some nodes reply as in situation on duplicate request 2) sendNymLog.txt - last section in the file - all nodes respond with ACK, but there is no one REPLY  Versions:  for the pool, apt is pointed at the rc branch, and the indy-node version is 1.2.44.  For the client, the apt is pointed at the stable branch, and the indy-node version is 1.1.0.  ></description> </Issue>

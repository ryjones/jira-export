CDATA *Problem reason:* - The CheckpointService is not used in the Replica.  *Changes:* - Integrate the CheckpointService  to the Replica - Remove old storages and methods from the Replica - Update tests  *PR:* *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1289  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1405   *Version:* * token-plugin 1.0.2 ~75-master * indy-node 1.9.2.dev1050 -master * (indy-plenum 1.9.2.dev861 -master)  *Risk factors:* - Catchup with checkpoints will not start  *Risk:* - Medium  *Recommendations for QA:* * Start a production load * Brake a not primary node for 2 checkpoints (200 batches) * Check that the node successfully caught up.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.9.2~dev1050 plugins 1.0.2~dev75  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run production load for 8+ hours. 2. Stop 10th node and start it after few minutes. 3. Wait for 10th node catchup. 4. Stop the load.  Actual Results: 10th node catch up successfully at Step 3 but after Step 4 3rd and 10th nodes have less amount of txn in all ledgers (276827 in domain) than all other nodes. Also 25th node has stalled a bit (277974 in domain, maybe because of OOM failure that appeared in journalctl). All 3 stalled nodes don't catch up after stopping the load for 2+ hours.

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.9.2~dev1050 plugins 1.0.2~dev75  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run production load with half load rate. 2. Stop 15th node and start it after few minutes. 3. Wait for 15th node catchup. 4. Stop the load. 5. Check that all nodes in pool are in sync.  Actual Results: Stopped node catches up and orders successfully under load. All nodes are in sync after the load.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We are seeing cases where nodes are not able to communicate with each other. It appears that the socket has become blocked. When this occurs restarting all the nodes in the pool gets things working again, but that is not really an option with a global setup.  *Consider:* Currently reaching the high water mark on zeromq socket drops any new messages (this happens for Router and Dealer socket types which we use), so the socket maintains a FIFO queue till reaching high water mark. Explore how to drop the messages of the FIFO queue from the beginning once high water mark is reached. The objective is to preserve and send recent messages and ignore old messages if needed.  ></description> </Issue>

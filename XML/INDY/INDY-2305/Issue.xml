CDATA The availability requirements for steward nodes are very high (99.9+% uptime).  In order to achieve this in cases of hardware failure, a steward node can run in a virtual environment such as kubernetes which provides failover from one failing node to another.  In order to provide greater HA for stewards, a steward node should be allowed to specify an IP address range which it will use for outbound TCP connections when connecting to other stewards.  This will allow a steward to failover to another piece of hardware which uses a different source IP address for outbound TCP connections.   ></description> </Issue>

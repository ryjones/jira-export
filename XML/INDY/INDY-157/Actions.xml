CDATA *Problem reason:* - The current delay till the scheduled upgrade instead of the upgrade time was written to {{Upgrader.scheduledUpgrade}} tuple.  *Changes:* - Fixed a bug with wrong "when" item in {{Upgrader.scheduledUpgrade}} tuple. This in turn fixed the bug with wrong "when" field in {{cancel}} messages of the upgrade log. - Corrected tests according to the fix. - Made some minor fixes (in tests) related to appending messages to the upgrade log.  *Committed into:* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/394 - indy-node 1.1.169 master  *Risk factors:* - None is expected.  *Risk:* - Low  ></body> </Action>

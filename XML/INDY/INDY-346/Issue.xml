CDATA Sovrin-Node deb package is not reproducible!  This is because the process of creating the deb artifact is not controlled by data in the sovrin-node repo but instead is controlled by the sovrin-packaging repo.  In particular, sovrin-node has pre and post install scripts that come from sovrin-packaging. And sovrin-packaging is not tag in the same way as sovrin-node during our build and publish process.     (Devin's option)  We need to relook at our process. We should design is such that all configuration, code and anything else that effect any artifact of our CI or build process must be contained in the repo that is being packaged.   Doing this has at least two benifits: # Makes the whole build pipeline reproducible from a tag in git. # Lowers the friction of non-evernym contributors to the code base (they don't have to know about sovrin-packaging or other repos) Especially since sovrin-packaging is a private repo.  ></description> </Issue>

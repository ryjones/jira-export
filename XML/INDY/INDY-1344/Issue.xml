CDATA Current implementation of view change is quite tangled with other codebase. This leads to following problems: - it cannot be made pluggable as is - it cannot be unit tested - it's hard to modify  Reimplementing legacy view change using TDD practices and adhering to new design will solve all above mentioned problems.   This ticket is just for implementation of core logic (implementing mocks for Network, Orderer and Checkpointer as needed). Work done on mocks can be shared with  INDY-1338|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1338 .  ></description> </Issue>

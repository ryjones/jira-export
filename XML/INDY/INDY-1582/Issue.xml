CDATA Currently we use a simple average when calculating the total throughput/latency of backupo instances to compare it with the master ones.  This may lead to problems of false positive View Changes when there is a spike on just one of a backups.  *Acceptance criteria* * Define a better way to calculate the average for backups. Consider median which is more robust to spikes.  * Write unit tests checking, in particular, that spikes should not trigger false positives. * Implement the changes  ></description> </Issue>

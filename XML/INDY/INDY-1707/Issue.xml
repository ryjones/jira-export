CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Create several NYMs in the wallet and send them to the ledger. 2. Try to run 'did rotate-key' for any of them.  *Actual Results:* Error message appears: {code:java} Transaction has been rejected: client request invalid: InsufficientCorrectSignatures(0, 1) {code} New verkey was updated in the domain ledger, but it was not updated in the wallet. So, DID can't be used anymore.  *Expected Result:* Verkey should be rotated in both of ledger and wallet.   *Additional Information:* The issue was noticed during running this instruction:Â https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QOfPsylBnSNa9Ke19IoXLdPbKvbXjdhYraRi4JDX8iA/edit  Logs and nscapture: s3://qanodelogs/TOK-434/NodeXX/ or:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KnymbWO9N8Dq-OY9Qun29brLtv8wdsEd   *WORKAROUND (how to get DID working again after this problem with rotation):* Use seed for key rotation. This case it will be possible to change verkey in the wallet manually using {code:java} did new did=<current DID> seed=<seed from failed rotate-key command>{code}  ></description> </Issue>

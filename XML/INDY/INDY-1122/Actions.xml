CDATA  ~SeanBohan_Sovrin   bq. are we using the logging module? bq. what sort of log setup is it missing? bq. how was the log object configured? Validator-info tool uses the same logging module as indy-node. There is no separate log setup and configuring for this tool.  bq. where should the log entries go? They go into /var/log/indy/validator-info.log (and it's ok) but the issue is that they double into shell output (there should be node statistics only without any logs).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We haven't seen such issues. And all the tests pass on Jenkins as well. How do you configure your dev environment? Do you follow the guide from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/setup-dev.md? BTW I can see that you use Unittest, while all the tests in Plenum/Node are based on pytest. The link above contains info on how to configure PyCharm to use pytest for test execution.  ></body> </Action>

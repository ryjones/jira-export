CDATA T-Shirt: XL  Build Info: indy-node 1.3.357  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run from 3 machines {1000 clients x 10 NYMs each} load test against 25 nodes pool. 2. Check script results and validator-info at all nodes.  Actual Results: Script doesn't finish because pool stops taking txns. Pool stops writing after 13..21k (differs on different nodes) txns written of 30k expected. Journalctl is in attachment. Nodes' logs will be added to google drive.  Workaround: Restart all nodes simulaneously several times to return pool in normal state.    ></description> </Issue>

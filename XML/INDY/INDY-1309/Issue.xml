CDATA The  indy process on the a new steward's validator node, which is in preparation for the live Sovrin network, is crashing after the catchup process is complete.  This is very easy to see in the attached files. The tar contains 2 files.  error.log contains the stack trace from journalctl.  VeridiumID.log is the indy log.  From my observation of the logs, it appears the error may be during primary selection, following the catchup of the ledgers.  Please compare the 16:16:15 time hacks in each file.  The attempt shown is to bring the node onto the STN.  ></description> </Issue>

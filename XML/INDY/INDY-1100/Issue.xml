CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.279  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool of 5 nodes. 2. Stop all nodes. 3. Delete value of "dest" attribute ("V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f") in default Trustee's entry of domain ledger transactions .ldb file on all nodes. 4. Delete all tree and state folders (with merkle leaves/nodes and state affixes) of all ledgers. 5. Start all nodes and client for this pool. 6. Send NYMs using default Trustee's key (`new key with seed 000000000000000000000000Trustee1`).  Actual Results: NYMs are added successfully and the signer of this transactions in ledger is default Trustee ("identifier" is default Trustee's DID) but his DID ("dest") is absent in ledger (Step 3) so the currently absent in ledger entity can add transactions to it (we suppose that Trustee's DID is still present in some cache storage like idr_cache_db).  The priority of this ticket is low now (case with bad data ledger is not common) but it can be discussed additionally.  ></description> </Issue>

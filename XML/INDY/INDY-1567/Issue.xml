CDATA We need to check that the pool works as expected when the load is not smooth, but with spikes, and there are periods of time when there are no write load.  *Acceptance criteria*  Provide test results for the following cases: * Do a load of 10 writes per sec and 100 reads per sec for 10 minutes (all txn except revocation), then stop the load for 10 mins. Repeat multiple times. * Permanent read of 100 txns per sec. Do a load of 10 writes per sec for 10 minutes (all txns except revocation), then stop the load. Repeat multiple times.  Monitor how stable we are, and how often view change happens.  ></description> </Issue>

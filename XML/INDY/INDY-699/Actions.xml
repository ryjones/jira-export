CDATA There is a problem in SCHEMA: In contradistinction to other requests GET_SCHEMA contains key parts (schema name and version) directly in a data field. This complicates state proof for missing schema - key fields should be removed from data before saving it to State and added back when retrieved.  It also makes client to check not just data field to be None, but also check whether it contains other fields except schema name and version.  ></body> </Action>

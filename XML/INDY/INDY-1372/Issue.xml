CDATA As of now only one CLAIM_DEF can be created for the same Schema, DID (creator) and Signature Type.  We need to introduce a `tag` field which can be used to distinguish CLAIM_DEFs for the same Schema/DID/Type.  See the proposed format here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests-new.md#claim_def   See the design for anoncreds txns (including CLAIM_DEF) here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/design/anoncreds.md  ></description> </Issue>

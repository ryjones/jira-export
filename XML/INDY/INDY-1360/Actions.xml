CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.4.478 libindy 1.4.0~596  *Steps to Validate:* 1. use AWS Live pool  2. create new pool with 22 nodes 3. write about 1k txns 4. demote node2 and node3 5. Repeatedly run  {code} for (( i=1; i <= 70; i++ )) do python3.5 perf_processes.py -g pool_transactions_genesis -c 1 -n 350 -k nym & done {code}  *Actual Results:* Pool ceases to form preperpare after 295k txns  *Additional Information:* Please, avoid standart numeration. live_node1, live_node11, live_node23 were unreachable, so numeration had been shifted live_node2 == Node1 ... live_node10 == Node9 live_node12 == Node10 ... live_node22 == Node20 live_node24 == Node21 live_node25 == Node22  ></body> </Action>

Unfortunately relevant part of logs from Node5 (which was primary that generated these messages) were lost, but looking at all other nodes it can be seen that only PREPREPARES starting from ppSeqNo 3 managed to get to non-primaries. We already have fix for this (plenum starting from 1.4.429,  PR|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/785 ), validation will be done in scope of  INDY-1343|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1343  and  INDY-1425|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1425 " created="2018-07-05 14:56:37.0" updateauthor="sergey.khoroshavin" updated="2018-07-05 14:57:04.0"/>

CDATA  ~nage   ~danielhardman   ~krw910   ~tharmon   ~SeanBohan_Sovrin  Some of the current scripts in sovrin-environment rely on `sovrin` packages, not indy-node (the only difference is in initial genesis transactions). Can we copy all scripts as is, and then re-factor them in a separate task to get rid of Sovrin dependency?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node master branch 1.2.261  Steps to Validate: 1. Git clone/pull indy-node master. 2. Set up docker environment from `~/indy-node/environment/docker/pool`. 3. Set up vagrant environment from `~/indy-node/environment/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm` (works for Windows only).  Actual Results: Both environments are set up successfully. Minor issues found in vagrant environment will be reported as separate tickets.  ></body> </Action>

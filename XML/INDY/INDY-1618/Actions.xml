CDATA When Node2 (backup primary) was switch off other nodes (12,13,14,15,25) fell behind and had a latency up to 20 minutes. But slow nodes catchuped all lost transactions after 40 minutes. Fix in the task https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1660 should fix this problem. Please, retest it again with version indy-node >= 1.6.586 (indy-plenum >= 1.6.529)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.599  Steps to Validate: 1. Run load test to provide ~20 txns written at pool side. 2. Stop primaries for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th backup instances consecutively. 3. Start primaries for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th backup instances consecutively. 4. Check throughput and latency using metrics.  Actual Results: Throughput and latency are not degraded during backup primaries stopping. !Inked1618_LI.jpg|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

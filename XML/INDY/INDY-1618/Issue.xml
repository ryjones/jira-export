CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.565  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool of 25 nodes. 2. Disable view changes and enable metrics. 3. Run load test ~100 NYMs/sec. 4. Stop the backup primary (1 instance for example) after 30 minutes. 5. Wait another 30 minutes and check throughput and latency metrics.  Actual Results: Throughput is degraded and latency is dramatically increased if backup primary is stopped.  Expected Results: Throughput and latency should be about the same with backup primary stopped.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The danube node on BuilderNet has the same number of txns for all ledgers yet displays 'false' for "Has_write_consensus" in validator-info for all 4 ledgers.  The problem was first noticed on Wednesday Mar 20, 2019.  After the problem was noticed, a nym was added to the ledger and the danube node did not update its ledger to match (it was then actually out of sync for a time) but after a restart the node caught up and txn count was correct, but after a while it once again showed that it was out of consensus in validator-info.  Today (Friday Mar 22) all nodes are reporting Has_write_consensus as False for all 4 ledgers (from results of get-validator-info)  Indy node version - 1.6.83   The new builder net has a total of 4 nodes in it from around the world and I own one of the nodes in it (FoundationBuilder).  I will attach logs from my node and from the danube node, but please note that the danube node validator log covering the time of the original problem are lost and unrecoverable.     ></description> </Issue>

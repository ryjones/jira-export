CDATA Short summary of things that happened: * danube missed one preprepare for freshness txn * started catchup but didn't receive the txn during that since catchup in that version (1.6.58 stable) brought only real ledger txns * after catchup the node received txns but since one txn is missed it stashed them * once new checkpoint came it did catchup again but it didn't help by the same reason * ... the same logic repeated  The issues is known and fixed in master in scope of INDY-2022  ></body> </Action>

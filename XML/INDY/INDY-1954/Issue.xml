CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.760  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Send GET_TXN to any ledger (including domain) for any txn. 2. Check reply.  Actual Results: There is no 'state_proof' field in the reply so state proof and freshness functionality doesn't affect pool and config ledgers since there are no special get txns for this ledgers. Actually since GET_TXN is based on Ledger's Merkle Tree, not Patricia State Trie, the more correct term here is `audit_proof`.  Expected Result: - There should be 'audit_proof' field in the reply for GET_TXN (see `{color:#333333}handle_get_txn_req{color}` in `node.py`). - The field content needs to be the same as for `state_proof` in other get requests (see  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests.md#reply-structure-for-read-requests).   - {{`proof_nodes}}` need to be the actual audit proof which can be obtained by `{color:#333333}merkleInfo{color}` method in `ledger.py`  Notes: * Ensure that the pluggable request handler for GET_TXN is properly called.  ></description> </Issue>

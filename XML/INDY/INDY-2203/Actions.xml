CDATA I've checked logs from failed nodes and they were doing client stack restart 10 seconds before shutdown, which was seemingly abnormal. It happened on Aug 13 around 22:05 UTC. Unfortunatelly journalctl was lost, so stack trace is not available. Good nodes were also doing client stack restart during that timeframe, so it might actually not be connected, but it still looks suspicious.  Anyways, this problem is not related to catch up, because nodes were not doing catch up when they shut down, and they obviously couldn't do catch up afterwards because they remained offline.  ></body> </Action>

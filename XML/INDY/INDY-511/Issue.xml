CDATA There are number of properties which do some initialization on first call and then return that cached value. To do it they use protected fields which are always in scope, but do nothing useful except of storing cached value.  We need decorator for this. There is *functools.lru_cache* decorator which does memorization. If it is created with *maxsize=1* it does exactly what we need. But it is too resource consuming.  Â   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~resplin  We need to push this ticket as soon as possible to get it int the next upgrade. The issue here is if a Steward just does an upgrade on their system it will pull down the latest indy-crypto without upgrading everything else and could break the system. We added a hold to all indy packages so they would not automatically upgrade which keeps everyone at the same version.   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We evaluated this for the 1.3.a hotfix (INDY-1331), but decided it didn't need to be included in the hot-fix because we don't have a plan to release indy-crypto before the release of Indy Node 1.4, and even if we do release before a steward is upgraded, it is likely that the release will be backwards compatible and not cause a problem.  We agree that this needs to be fixed in the 1.4.0 release, but we are minimizing our effort on the hotfix.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA kdenhartog commented on Jun 8 Figured out an alternative way using the docker script. It was confusing to know the version for the build with build-indy-plenum-docker.sh because I had to include a version. Also, running the container was confusing, so I'm going to make an PR to the documentation for that and help my team migrate to developing within the docker instances. docker run -it --name indy-plenum -v <local repo location>/indy-plenum:/home/indy-dev indy-plenum-build-u1604 bash  ></body> </Action>

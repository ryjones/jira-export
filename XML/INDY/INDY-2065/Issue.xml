CDATA Evernym PyPI's account holds dozens outdated packages: plenum, plenum-dev, indy-plenum-dev, indy-node-dev, anoncreds ones, some other tmp/dev variations of plenum and node. It makes sense to review and clean.  Questions: * Should we review the packages first? * Is there additional clean-up that is needed, such as out-of-date build scripts?  ></description> </Issue>

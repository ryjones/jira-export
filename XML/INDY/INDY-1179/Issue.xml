CDATA *Case 1:* "selected primary for instance 2" are different for different nodes after demotion of primary node !11111.png|thumbnail!  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 7 nodes. 2. Demote primary node (node 2 in this case). => View change happened on the rest nodes. "selected primary Node5 for instance 1" andÂ "selected primary Node5 for instance 2" on all of them. (like in INDY-1112) 3. Promote demoted node back.  *Actual Result:* On Node2 "selected primary Node6 for instance 2". It differs from the rest nodes.  *Expected Results:* Selected primary for instance 2 should be the same on all of nodes.  *Case 2:* After demote and promote primary (node2) node1 has stopped to writing NYMs. Logs are attached. *Steps to Reproduce:* The same as in previous case, but selected primaries are different: !image-2018-02-15-11-26-09-005.png|thumbnail!  ></description> </Issue>

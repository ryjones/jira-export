CDATA  ~mzk-vct  I like the idea of having a fake build to test. What we are trying to avoid is what we just had happen. A break in the upgrade process was introduced in a new build. The upgrade to that build was successful and there was no way to know the next upgrade would not work until it was tried. So that is the scenario we are trying to avoid by using this fake upgrade. We may need a different repo to hold this fake package and we can just change the sources.list file to point to this other location and I think that is fine. We want to keep it simple and not create a large amount of extra work. I would like to see a proposal on how we can accomplish this task. Let also make sure we name the package to indicate what it is for so it does not accidentally get used. Something like "SovrinUpgradeTestPackage". Also have it provide the appropriate packages/files.  ></body> </Action>

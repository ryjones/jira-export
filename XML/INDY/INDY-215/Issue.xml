CDATA  In testing INDY-159 I found the following issue.  *Setup* 4 Nodes 1 Client   *Steps* # Added a NYM transaction to the pool # Stopped the sovrin-node service on Node 1 # Sent another add NYM transaction # When I sent the second transaction it was not processed. The CLI did not show 'Added NYM' # I restarted the sovrin-node.service on Node 1 and sent a few more transactions which did not go through. # I had to stop the sovrin-node service on all 4 nodes and bring them up one at a time.  *{color:#d04437}Issue{color}* When I checked the transactions file they all were in sync, but I had several empty entries and realized that was where I was sending transactions and the pool did not reach consensus.   Log files are attached from Node 1    ></description> </Issue>

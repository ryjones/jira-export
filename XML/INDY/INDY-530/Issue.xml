CDATA Â   For now test deps declared in setup.py in 'tests_require' section but it's a setuptools's thing and pip doesn't support it. Thus we have to 'manually' add these packages during test env configuring instead of just 'pip install ...'  As a better approach we can use setuptools's  extras_require|https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies  field which is  supported by pip|https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#examples .  In such case we will get the following advantages: - we can use e.g. 'pip install . test ' or 'pip install plenum test '. - don't need to waste time for exploring test_require manually when building new pipeline in Jenkins (cause we need these packages for testing but 'pip install .' won't install it)  POA: * update and clean up (where it necessary) setup.py files in all repos: {code} tests_require =  'pack1', 'pack2' ...  setup( ... tests_require=tests_require, extras_require={ 'test': tests_require } ... ) {code}  * update Jenkins scripts to use 'pip install . test ' and remove unnecessary installation routine  ></description> </Issue>

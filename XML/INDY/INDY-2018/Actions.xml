CDATA Problem reason/description: - Problem is that validation allowed usage of incorrect Ed25519 keys as a node key. That cause a nodes to crush when it tries to connect to a node with invalid key.  Changes: - Additional validation added to forbid incorrectÂ Ed25519 to be used.  PR: -  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1137   Version: -  h4.  indy-node: 1.6.874-master|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/releases/tag/1.6.874-master   Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: -  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1213/files#diff-999ae9862d4ff40ce96537278cbfe495   Recommendations for QA - Retest description case and ensure that requests with invalid node's keys will be rejected.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA With the way view change works when the entire pool is restarted it resets the selection of the master and backup nodes in the order of the pool_transactions_sandbox (or live) file. So Node1 always is set as the master when the entire pool is restarted.  The test is to demote Node1 as a Trustee and then restart the entire pool to see if a different Node defaults to be the primary.  Start the CLI  sovrin connect test new key with seed 000000000000000000000000Trustee1 send NODE dest=Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv data={'alias': 'Node1', 'services':   }  Restart the entire pool   ></description> </Issue>

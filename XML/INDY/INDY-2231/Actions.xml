CDATA *Changes:* * do not stabilize checkpoints from NewView during view change on nodes lagging behind (that is if a node doesn't have this checkpoint) * change quorum (from weak to strong certificate) when calculating a checkpoint for NewView. This is needed to make sure that view change is finished and nodes can order without catchup before processing NewView. Now the checkpoint can be lower, so more re-ordering may be needed. See INDY-2237 for details. * added simulation tests with random seeds * fixes in stabilization of checkpoints after catch-up * fixes in ordering after catch-up and view change * fixes and improvements in tests  *PR:* *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1359   *Covered by tests:* * plenum/test/consensus/view_change/test_new_view_builder.py * plenum/test/consensus/view_change/test_sim_view_change.py * plenum/test/view_change_service/test_lag_by_checkpoint.py  *Recommendation for QA:* * Do a load test in the scope of INDY-2146  *Risk:* * Low  ></body> </Action>

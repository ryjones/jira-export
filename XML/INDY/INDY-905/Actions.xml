There was a missing rule in Authorizer for changing of bls-key. Also added unit tests for Authorizer (we didn't have any) and integration test to change BLS keys from CLI.  PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/400  Fixed in 1.1.165  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.1.167  Preconditions: Install pool of 4 nodes.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Generate new blskey for Node1. 2. Send node txn with new blskey as Steward1. 3. Send NYM to check that pool is working. 4. Send node txn from Step 2 as Trustee1.  Actual Results: Step 4 txn performs successfully. !trustee_changes_bls.PNG|thumbnail!

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.1.173  Steps To Validate: 1. Generate new blskey for Node1. 2. Send node txn with new blskey as Trustee1 (or other role that is not a Steward of Node1).  Actual Results: "%ROLENAME% not in allowed roles  'STEWARD' " error message.  Additional Info: If we send node txn as Steward of node and send it again (without changes) as any other role - permissions don't check (because node info is not updated) so txn looks successful in the CLI. It will be fixed in scope of separate ticket. !905.PNG|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

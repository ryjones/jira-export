CDATA PBFT requires checkpoints as a mechanism that is triggered periodically to make sure every node has processed (and persisted) the same requests (across batches) in the same order. We do not require checkpoints since Pre-Prepare contains expected merkle roots (txn and state merkle tr(i/e)e roots after applying the requests of the PrePrepare) and a Pre-Prepare can be only processed if the previous Pre-Prepare was received and processed successfully (not committed necessarily). Thus it cannot happen that a node skips processing any PrePrepare. To handle the case where a node gets a Pre-Prepare(s) and maybe Prepares too but is not getting sufficient Commits, a node can use `MESSAGE_REQUEST` to request missing 3 phase messages or start catchup once it has seen `n` Pre-Prepares (and maybe some Prepares too) but not been able to order them or it has >2f COMMIT(s) for a `pp_seq_no` that is greater than its last ordered sequence number by `n`    ></description> </Issue>

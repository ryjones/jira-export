CDATA We are still chasing this down, but here is what we know so far.  *{color:#205081}Scenario 1{color}* * Started with 4 nodes in a pool. * Added two more nodes to the pool and they did a catch up with the pool. I had 35 transactions. * I then demoted the two new nodes setting 'services':    and added the nodes back with setting 'services':  'VALIDATOR'  * I then sent another 28 transactions. Nodes 1-4 (original nodes) had 63 transactions {color:#d04437}Nodes 5-6 (added nodes) did not receive an new transactions after the initial sync. If I restart sovrin-node.serivce they would catch up again.{color} {color:#d04437}However the new nodes never receive any new transactions and only catch up if you restart the service.{color}  *{color:#205081}Scenario 2{color}* Same as above, but in this pool after adding the new nodes the catch process never happened.  *{color:#205081}Scenario 3{color}* I shutdown the sovrin-node.service on Node 2 which is one of the original nodes. When I restarted the service it would not catch up or take new transactions.  Current thinking is that we are dealing with a consistency issue during catch where due to an inconstancy the node stops talking to the node that is sending the updated ledger information.    ></description> </Issue>

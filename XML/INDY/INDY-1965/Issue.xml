CDATA *Problem:* * Load acceptance test (see INDY-1949, cases 2 and 3) * Some of the nodes starting to be very slow * So, some instances order slower, and the requests queue grows * That leads to OOM eventually * It looks like one of the reason of the slowness of nodes is a lot of messages requests for Propagates at some point (that is a node receives PrePrepares with non-finalized requests).  *Acceptance criteria* * Find out why so many Messages Requests for Propagates is started to be sent * Check if this is the only source of the issue * Make a fix or create a separate ticket for the fix if needed  ></description> </Issue>

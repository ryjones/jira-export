CDATA During testing INDY-246 we found what a node stops the catchup procedure  if gets f+1 old LedgerStatus.  {quote} My findings: the pool is broken because not only Node2 and Node9 crashed with KeyError but at least Node6 and Node7 crashed too Node6, Node7 (and maybe some others) finished catchup successfully Node2, Node9 did not finished catchup because they got enough ledger status messages from others crashed nodes and they stopped their catchup I am working on solution which increases the quorum for LedgerStatus messages. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/299{quote}  We had to create this ticket because the issue does not related with INDY-246.   ></description> </Issue>

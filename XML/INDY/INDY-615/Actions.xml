CDATA  ~krw910  Now we spend ~26 seconds on the average to read 1000 NYMs to ledger with --at-once option, ~30000 seconds on the average to read 100k NYMs from ledger without --at-once option (10 clients / 10000 reads for each) and ~4000 seconds on the average to read 100k NYMs from ledger with overmind.sh script (100 clients / 1000 reads for each) (1.1.37 RC version / AWS Performance Pool). There are an errors during sending more than ~2500 GET_NYMs at once: "retryForExpected not found in repeating actions" and at the end of the test run script doesn't disconnect from nodes normally due to exceptions from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/stp_core/loop/looper.py.  ></body> </Action>

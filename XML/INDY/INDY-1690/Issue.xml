CDATA There should be a CHANGELOG.md file in the root of the Indy Node git repo.  It should contain brief release notes for the previous releases, back to 1.1.37.  Release notes should contain: * A summary of major changes * Brief notes about upgrades and behavior * Any known issues that are important to communicate  The top of the changelog should include this explanation (with links): "Details about what is included in this release can be found by browsing the fix version in the Hyperledger Issue Tracker and the tag in GitHub."  Format should be similar to the CHANGELOG.md in the indy-skd.  Contents can come from the Sovrin release notes that accompanied each Indy Node release: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/release-notes.md  ></description> </Issue>

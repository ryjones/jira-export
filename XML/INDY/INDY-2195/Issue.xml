CDATA Options: # nightly build pipeline for ubuntu 20.04 # both nightly and CD pipelines check system tests in ubuntu 20.04 env # nightly for master, CD only for releases  Acceptance criteria: # system tests in 20.04 env should be run by CI server automatically ** We may reduce the frequency of system tests run. For example, one nigh run tests on 16.04 only, and the other night on 20.04 only. # CD for master shouldn't require much more time than it is now # CD during release process must check system tests in both env  Notes: * We need to continue building and testing Ubuntu 16.04 for some period of time, but Ubuntu 20.04 should be our focus. Most automated tests should be with Ubunut 20.04, and Ubuntu 16.04 only needs sanity checks and release tests.  ></description> </Issue>

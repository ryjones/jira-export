CDATA Problem reason: - hard to understand reason of failed tests without logs from nodes  Changes: * improved test-automation repo to support optional logs gathering from nodes, for now the following files are collected: ** logs from "/var/log/indy/sandbox/" ** files from "/var/lib/indy/sandbox/"Â (genesis and validator info files) * updated indy-node pipeline to attach garthered files to list of build artifacts * *note*: for now journalctl and ledgers are not gathered  PR: * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation/pull/45 *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation/pull/46  * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1386  Version: * indy-test-automation, v. 0.8.7 * indy-node, v. 1.9.0.dev1038  Risk factors: * impacts cd pipeline  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - no  Recommendations for QA - check the following builds results: **  https://build.sovrin.org/job/test-pipelines/job/indy-node-nightly-test/59/  ** https://build.sovrin.org/job/indy-node/job/indy-node-cd/job/master/1038/  ></body> </Action>

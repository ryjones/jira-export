CDATA As of now failed system tests are not supplied with any pool data. It makes hard to understand the reasons of failures. It would be useful to grab such data as node logs, journal logs and metrics from the tests pools.  Concerns: # some failures are not related to pool functionality and client-pool communication but rather to python code (e.g. syntax errors, key/index errors) # in case of many failures there would be too many data, options: ** archive data ** filter data (e.g. by time, by node, by request id) ** omit some data (e.g. there is a fixture to check failures in journal logs, thus these logs might be omitted if no such errors detected)  Acceptance criteria: # pool data should be enough to understand system tests failures # CD pipeline should be updated to attach that data to pipeline results  ></description> </Issue>

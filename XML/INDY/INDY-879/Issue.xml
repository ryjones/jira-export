CDATA - Re-factor config.py to have only parameters that can be configured by the user - All other parameters can be just constants (in the code) - Each configurable parameter must have tests to make sure that it's really configurable and it doesn't break the system - All parameters that can be configured must be available and known for the end user. Default or disabled values must be present in user's config (/etc/indy/conf for deb)  ></description> </Issue>

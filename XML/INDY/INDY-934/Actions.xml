CDATA  ~ozheregelya  or  ~krw910  - It is great that "batch mode" works as it should. Is the following not a valid use of sovrin CLI? If not, shouldn't the CLI prevent anyone from using it this way? {code:java} sovrin "new key" "exit"{code}  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ckochenower , I never tried to use sovrin-cli that way, but I think this is valid use. The point is that new indy-cli will replace sovrin-cli soon, so this fix in sovrin-cli will not make sense.  ></body> </Action>

If indy-cli is not derived from sovrin-cli and does not have this same flaw, then I say close the issue. The &quot;invalid&quot; designation was confusing.

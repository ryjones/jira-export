CDATA *Issue reason* - it looks like ZMQ sockets can not re-establish connections when re-creating sockets from the first time, so multiple attempts may be needed - each attempt to re-create a socket has been done every 30 secs only  *Change* - increase the frequency of re-connect re-tries to 8 secs (try every 2 secs; re-send pings 3 times and recreate socket on the 4th time)  *PR* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1315 - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1439  *Test* - `stp_zmq/test/test_reconnect_multi.py `  *Recommendations for QA* - check how the changes affect system tests - run load test  - run load test with one node disconnected to make sure that more attempts to re-connect doesn't break anything  *Build* - 1.10.0.dev1077 - 1.0.3~dev86  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.10.0.dev1077 plugins 1.0.3~dev86  Actual Results: There are no unexpected failures in system tests (in CD and locally). Production load test looks good but there are some issues with BLS signatures during production load test with one node stopped (reported in INDY-1932).  ></body> </Action>

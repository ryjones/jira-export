CDATA As a Steward I want to see *upgrade timeout expiry* result in node's upgrade log in this and similar to this cases (INDY-1447):  _The upgrade was scheduled for 07/20 11:20. Node1 started the upgrade but failed to complete it at 11:30:33 because 300 seconds timeout for apt update command was exceeded. Before the moment of apt update timeout was exceeded, indy-node service had re-sent an upgrade message to indy-node-control service at 11:30:00 because Upgrader's 10 minute timeout for upgrade was exceeded._  Now we have the next entries in the upgrade log when we cannot start the upgrade due to slow network or unavailable indy-node-control service so it is hard to understand why we have too many scheduled and started entries but don't have failed/succeeded entries before 11:36: {noformat} 2018-07-20 11:15:54.184776	scheduled	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:20:00.267384	started	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:20:14.022571	scheduled	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:20:14.025329	started	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:21:14.568795	scheduled	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:21:14.572383	started	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:30:00.286141	scheduled	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:30:00.286577	started	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:30:39.492017	scheduled	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:30:39.495043	started	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 2018-07-20 11:36:48.718960	failed	2018-07-20 11:20:00.258870+00:00	1.5.511	1532085354142718 {noformat}   ></description> </Issue>

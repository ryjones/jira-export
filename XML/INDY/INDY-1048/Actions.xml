CDATA *Case 1:* Steps to Validate: 1. Setup the machine with installed sovrin package. 2. Set yourself as any user differ from indy. 3. Try to generate genesis transactions for client: {code:java} generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 4 --ips '10.20.30.201,10.20.30.202,10.20.30.203,10.20.30.204'{code}  Actual Results: Genesis files were successfully generated.     *Case 2:* Steps to Validate: 1. Setup the machine with installed sovrin package. 2. Set yourself as any user differ from indy. 3. Try to generate transactions for node:    {code:java} generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 4 --nodeNum 1 --ips '10.20.30.201,10.20.30.202,10.20.30.203,10.20.30.204'  {code} => Permission denied error appear. 4. To workaround this permission denied error, add current user to _indy_ group and retry generation of genesis files.  Actual Results: Genesis files were generated, but owner of indy configs was changed to current user. But we assume that only _indy_ user can configure node (confirmed with  ~krw910 ), so this case is not included in current workflow and this behavior is acceptable.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Problem reason* Wrongs IDs were used for GET_SCHEMA and GET_CLAIM_DEF requests when verifying the state proof on the client side. So, when submitter (who sent SCHEMA) and reader (who sent GET_SCHEMA) differ, state proof was wrong. Everything worked since we fall back to f+1 consensus.  *Fix* Use correct IDs of submitter ("origin" for CLAIM_DEF and "dest" for SCHEMA)  *PR*: - to master: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/463 - to stable: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/462  *Tests*: - test_state_proof_for_get_requests.py  *Build*: - rc: 1.2.47 - master: 1.2.215   ></body> </Action>

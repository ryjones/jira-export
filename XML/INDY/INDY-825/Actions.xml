CDATA The steps I did to get this pool into this state was the following:  Started with a pool that contained 4 nodes Went to add three more nodes to the pool Added Node 5 Added Node 6 Went to add Node 7 and the transaction did not go through.  I checked the ledger sizes and Nodes 1 - 6 all had matching ledgers (at least they appear to have matching ledgers). I restarted the pool and still could not get consensus. It appears that Nodes 4, 5 and 6 show Node 1 as the primary (in the logs). Nodes 1, 2 and 3 do not show any primary nodes (in the logs).  ></body> </Action>

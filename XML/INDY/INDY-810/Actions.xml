CDATA Problem reason: - asserts are silently removed in production, thus they shouldn't be used in cases where errors are expected and exceptions are better there  Changes: - reviewed asserts in indy-plenum, replaced with exceptions where needed, added tests  Committed into: - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/726 - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/748  Risk factors: - broken CI testing  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - added unit or integration tests for any change  Recommendations for QA: do the following sequence of steps * nothing more than tests should pass  ></body> </Action>

The result to our stewards is that even though indy was upgraded, there remains a package, sovrin, that was not. This plays havoc with the automated tools that enterprises use to maintain the state of their systems." priority="3" resolution="10001" status="10001" created="2018-01-11 21:46:34.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:35:43.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:35:43.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="26761"/>

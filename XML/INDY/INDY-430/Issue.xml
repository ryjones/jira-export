CDATA It looks like if a node has a different list of who is primary than other nodes in the pool is does not receive new transactions.  I got setup to do load testing today. I ran add_key.py to get 200 trust anchors added. I was watching the ledger count on just Node1 and it didn't seem like it worked so I ran it again. After trying to find out what happened. I checked the other ledgers and found they all had a count of 436 which would be correct. Only Node1 was at 76 in the ledger.  I restarted Node1 and it did a catch up so now all nodes had a ledger count of 436.  *{color:#d04437}Mismatch{color}* I then ran load_test.py and sent just 10 new transactions. I checked the ledger counts and Node1 still had 436 and Nodes 2-10 all had 446. So only nodes 2-10 processed the new transactions.  I did a search for "primary is" and "selected primary" in the log files and found the following *Node1 showed* {color:#d04437}Node1:0 - Master{color} Node2:1 Node3:2 Node4:3  *Node2 through Node10 showed* {color:#14892c}Node2:0 - Master{color} Node3:1 Node4:2 Node5:3  ></description> </Issue>

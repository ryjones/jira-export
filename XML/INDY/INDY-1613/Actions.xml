CDATA * *Description:*  * Very similar to PBFT with a new leader in every round * no explicit view change, leader is changed every round * uses locking to simplify conflict resolution   * Used as consensus engine in multi-blockchain platform Cosmos  * *Pros:*  * The protocol has formal verification proofs * Has multiple implementations * The main implementation is pretty advanced with many tricks that greatly helps with performance and stability (more on this in next section) * The protocol has been tested with Jepsen, probably the most comprehensive and popular toolkit used to test distributed systems * A new leader every round, so stewards can be awarded tokens based on number of requests they put into ordering   * *Cons:* * Only 1 batch in flight, so potentially worse performance  * *Links:*  *  https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/buchman2016tendermint.pdf   Â   More details in  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WCwyFMkKJFjaUGlysp49Pitjcv6TIayEMKzCaKzUf_g/edit#slide=id.g4245334205_0_989   The protocol looks good, and can be considered as one of the main candidates if we write Plenum from scratch. As for applying it to existing code base, this may be more tricky.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As of now the only way to check what Endorser was used to submit a transaction is to look at the transaction itself (GET_TXN request). This looks fine from most of the current use cases point of view (for example, Sovrin scripts).  But it would be great to know who was transaction Endorser when querying data via other GET requests with state proofs such as GET_NYM, GET_SCHEMA, GET_CLAIM_DEF, GET_REVOC_REG_DEF, GET_REVOC_REG_ENTRY.  ></description> </Issue>

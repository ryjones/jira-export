CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.1.176  Overview: Pool is unable to perform view change during blskeys rotation.  Preconditions: Pool of 3 nodes is installed.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start CLI and send NYM to check that pool works. 2. Change blskey for Node1 -> Restart CLI -> Send NYM txn. 3. Change blskey for Node2 -> Restart CLI -> Send NYM txn. 4. Change blskey for Node3 -> Restart CLI -> Send NYM txn.  Actual Results: Step 4 NYM is not added due to the pool is broken. Node1 and Node2 cannot perform view change after Node3 blskey changing. See logs for additional info.  Expected Results: Pool should work normally.  Additional Info: The similar case with pool of 4 nodes works but the 3th node was restarted twice spontaneously due to send NODE command (see screenshot).   ></description> </Issue>

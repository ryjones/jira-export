CDATA The current findings: 1) I don't see many disconnections, juat a few (which is normal I think) 2) The content of the Ledger's txns is the same. Some of the txns have empty line at the end, that's why we have 963 vs 962 lines.  3) Node4 failed (INDY-70) with assertion 4) We have a problem with unexpectable view changes (INDY-34) and view change is broken until INDY-13, INDY-14 are fixed. So, it looks like it's the cause (once we face a view change, we can not sync up anymore).  ></body> </Action>

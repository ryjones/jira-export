CDATA I ran the load_test.py scripts against my performance pool of 7 global nodes. After 1800 transactions of send NYM the nodes began to be out of sync.  I also see a large amount of "disconnected" entries in the Node log files where the nodes are disconnecting from each other.  *I sent the following load script commands from one client*  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 500  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 500 --at-once  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 750 --at-once  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 1000 --at-once  *I sent the following from 4 different clients at the same time, but nothing wrote to the ledger. I was out of sync before this point and the pool stopped accepting writes.*  python3 load_test.py --clients-list load_test_clients.list -t NYM -c 1 -r 500 --at-once  *Here are line counts of my transactions file so show where I am out of sync. With the chunked files it gets out of sync in file 2.* --------- Node1      Node2      Node3      Node4      Node5     Node6     Node7 File 1         1001         1001        1001        1001         1001        1001        1001 File 1001   1000         1001        1001          812         1000        1000        1000 File 2001     962           962          962           ---            963          962           963  So the two issues are I am out of sync and there is a large number of disconnects. They must be related in some way.  If you restart the services the pool should start to take transactions again. At least when I have seen this before that fixed the issue with taking more transactions. However the nodes that are out of sync would not get back in sync.       ></description> </Issue>

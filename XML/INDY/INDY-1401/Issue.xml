CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 4 node. (11 txns in domain ledger: 9 genesis + 2 nyms) 2. Add the 5th node: 2.1. Initialize node. 2.2. Copy genesis files to new node. 2.3. Start node. 2.4. Send Node txn with new node. 3. Send several txns to make sure that added node works. (13 txns in domain ledger) => Node successfully added. (Note that steps are exactly the same as in INDY-1390 and INDY-1390 may reproduce.) 4. Add the 6th node: 4.1. Initialize node. 4.2. Copy genesis files to new node. 4.3. Send Node txn with new node. 4.4. Start node. => Domain and pool ledgers are the same on all nodes. 5. Send several txns.  *Actual Results:* New txns were not written on newly added (6th) node. Domain ledger size on the 6th node is 13, for the rest nodes it's 15 txns.  *Expected Results:* Node should work correctly after adding.        *Acceptance criteria:* - find the cause, PoA and fix  ></description> </Issue>

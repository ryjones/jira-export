CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.614 libindy 1.6.5~759 load script 1.0.5  See more details in *Test run 5* and  *Test run 6* from INDY-1607: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1607?focusedCommentId=51348&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-51348    *Test Run 5:* There are no fees set in the pool. Load was increased from 5 to 10 txns/sec. Only 10K payments txns were written because of problem with load script (INDY-1737). The last payment txn was written at 09/27/2018 @ 9:05pm (UTC), first OOM failure was near 23:00. Pool was working during 5 hours before first OOM (in previous tests without payments it was able to work up to 50 hours). s3://qanodelogs/INDY-1607-Live-27-09-18-mix-no-fees  *Test Run 6:* There were the same load as in Test Run 5 and the same problem with load script was reproduced. When 10K txns were written to domain ledger and ~20K txns to sovtoken ledger were written, load test stopped writing valid requests with fees and started to write txns without fees (which should be rejected). According to metrics, right after end of valid requests, pool failed with OOM. s3://qanodelogs/INDY-1607-Live-27-09-18-mix-fees  ></description> </Issue>

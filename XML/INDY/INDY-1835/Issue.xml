CDATA A PreViewChange strategy was implemented in the scope of INDY-1687 to speed-up and improve stability of the view change. It's currently disabled by default.  *Acceptance criteria* * Make sure that it doesn't have any side-affects * Do more load testing (with regular view changes) with strategy enabled: ** do 10 NYMs per sec  ** check that most of view changes are quite fast ** check that view changes don't lead to broken ledgers (all ledger are in sync eventually) ** enable the strategy by default  ></description> </Issue>

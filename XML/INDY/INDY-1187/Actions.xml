CDATA PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/596  Python libraries to install: matplotlib, yaml  How testing can be done: - get log files from nodes and place them somewhere locally - get process_logs and process_logs.yml from indy-plenum (they don't have any dependencies on other indy code, so it's not necessary to clone whole repository) - copy example_track_req.yml where appropriate, edit it so that it points to previously obtained log files - run "process_logs example_track_req.yml" - during processing tool should report which files it's processing, in the end it should report summary request statistics, dump request received/ordered messages to output.log and show graphs depicting request received/ordered events per second - read documentation, experiment with configs, try example_track_single_req.yml   ></body> </Action>

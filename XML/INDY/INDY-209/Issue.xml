CDATA When dealing with keys of various types, which are really just large numbers, There are various ways to represent them to humans.  Sovrin seems to use them all - hexadecimal, base58, x85, etc.  These should be standardized, and a single representation should be used throughout Sovrin.  Example:  recently a note in the Alpha network was not communicating properly with other validators. The log message was this:  2017-06-13 15:00:14,025 | DEBUG | zstack.py ( 683) | handlePingPong | ev1 got ping from b'\{8pT}}%5v=qw0m>HUfdvJG<{/ zLO*P s:$HKDZv' 2017-06-13 15:00:14,025 | DEBUG | zstack.py ( 788) | sendPingPong | ev1 will be sending in batch 2017-06-13 15:00:14,026 | WARNING | batched.py ( 103) | flushOutBoxes | ev1 rid b'\{8pT}}%5v=qw0m>HUfdvJG<{/ zLO*P s:$HKDZv' has been removed 2017-06-13 15:00:14,026 | DEBUG | message_processor.py ( 29) | discard | ev1 discarding message deque( b'po' ) because rid b'\{8pT}}%5v=qw0m>HUfdvJG<{/ zLO*P s:$HKDZv' no longer available  This was difficult to debug since "b'\{8pT}}%5v=qw0m>HUfdvJG<{/ zLO*P s:$HKDZv' " does not correspond to any recognizable entry in a transaction file.      *Acceptance criteria:* * init_indy_node must output a public key and verification key in base58 * check that there are not other public places where we output non-base58  ></description> </Issue>

The main issue in this ticket is that the pool wrote a transaction days later which is a duplicate of earlier transactions. If you can duplicate it with 1.1.43 try with 1.2.50." created="2018-01-15 21:48:16.0" updateauthor="krw910" updated="2018-01-15 21:48:16.0"/>

CDATA  ~krw910 ,  ~mgbailey , As I can see in logs, duplicate transactions were written right after view change. So, steps are the same as in INDY-1047. INDY-1047 was reproduced on indy-node 1.2.242 version. It means that this problem will reproduce on both previous stables: 1.1.43 and 1.2.50. But this problem was fixed in the latest master. I think we should close this ticket because it was re-tested during re-testing of INDY-1047 and wasn't reproduced.  ></body> </Action>

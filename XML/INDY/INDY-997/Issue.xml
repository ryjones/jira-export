CDATA Currently CD routine for both building and publishing is placed in private  jenkins-shared|https://github.com/evernym/jenkins-shared  and  sovrin-packaging|https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-packaging  repos. And it makes really hard to contribute for developers from outside the Evernym organization.  The solution could be to split mentioned private repos to private and public parts: * Public part will get the code for building. It also could define common CD pipeline steps sequence, implement them as a templates and provide an API to pass things specific for different environment (like credentials references, callback functions for delivering logic etc.). Also someday we can move there CI logic to resolve copy-paste madness between Jenkinsfile.ci in Indy core github repos. * private will keep all things specific for Evernym company (like credentials references, publishing: packaging repos endpoints, specific logic of debian/centos... management). It will configure the public part  Also once we make public repo we should be able to verify PRs for it. Thus, we need testing pipeline on Jenkins as well.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Indy-sdk integration test on Jenkins often fails because of node response with outdated data. (For pool from 4 Nodes) For example: 1) Sends Attrib request. 2) Gets response from two nodes (Node1, Node2) 3) Sends GetAttrib request. 3) Gets response from other two nodes (Node3, Node4) with empty Attrib data. See the attached file which demonstrates log of the failed test.  ></description> </Issue>

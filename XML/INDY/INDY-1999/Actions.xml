CDATA Another thing we need to state explicitly: if Endorser field is added, there must be a signature from the Endorser to make sure that Endorser approves the business relationship.  Also I believe this should be fine to assume that the author has a DID on the ledger (except creation of new DIDs , INDY-2171). But this may lead to a problem with a plugin transaction which doesn't require any DID-based signatures because of correlation. If we support a use case that this txn may have an Endorser, then it must be signed by both original author and the endorser, so the author has to have a signature on the ledger.  Another option is if we use cryptonyms in case there is no DID on the ledger.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We currently expect that writes of schemas and cred defs should only be done by entities who already have a DID on the ledger. In INDY-2170 we considered relaxing that assumption, but decided not to change that assumption at this time. If we change it in the future, we expect that this behavior would also be impacted.  Endorsing the transactions of an author is only required when the author is not providing payment. I updated the notes in the story description to clarify that payment transactions handled by ledger plugins cannot be endorsed.  ></body> </Action>

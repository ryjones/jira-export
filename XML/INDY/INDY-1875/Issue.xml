CDATA *Story* As a steward of node on an Indy network, I need to backup the indy database without stopping the service so that in the event of a failure I can quickly restore in order to meet up-time requirements.  *Notes* * Synchronizing the Sovrin Test Net (currently less than 100,000 transactions) takes over an hour on a fresh system. * RocksDb APIs exist for backing up the live database. It would help to have scripts that will backup and restore the database when commanded by an admin, without requiring that the service be stopped first. These scripts should be able to be run in non-interactive mode, so that they in turn may scripted.  ></description> </Issue>

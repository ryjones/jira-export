CDATA We investigated this last summer when we were trying to take a snapshot of a node that we could restore for debugging purposes. You can see our proof of concept here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/tools/diagnostics  It worked in some situations, but we found that there were a lot of structures in memory that weren't being persisted.  With the addition of the BLS signatures, the freshness checks, and the audit ledger, that situation is likely to have changed.  Evernym won't be able to come back to this project until later in the year, but we would love to discuss strategies with someone who is able to dig in sooner.  ></body> </Action>

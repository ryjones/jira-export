CDATA I've done most of the work at:   https://github.com/devin-fisher/plenum/tree/test_network_did    https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/261   but it is causing issues with the tests that I don't really understand.   https://ci.evernym.com/job/Plenum/view/change-requests/job/PR-261/1/console      I think it would be quicker to have someone with more experience with plenum get the test working again.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~devin-fisher  This looks very weird. The errors seem to be not related to your changes. Let's wait for the results of next test run. Probably there was some error that makes all other tests fail.  ></body> </Action>

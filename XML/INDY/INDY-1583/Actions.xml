CDATA Problem reason: * After steps in description, pool stopped writing txns.  Research: * Pool stopped ordering because had no quorum for PREPARES for new txns. Because Node3 that've just connected cant send PREPARE. * Node3 can't send PREPARE because it discard PRE-PREPARE fir this txns. * It discard PRE-PREPARE because of reason "PRE-PREPARE being sent to primary" * That behaviour is unpredictable and hard to inverstigate and it will be researched in scope of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1163   Changes: * For now, it was decided to remove this check as it seems to be pointless  Committed into: * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/878  Recommendations for QA:  * Retest this case with actual node  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.569 indy-plenum 1.6.512  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1) Make sure that Node1 is primary 2) stop service on Node2 3) stop service on Node3 4) send nym 5) demote Node6 6) start service on Node3 7) try to send nym  *Actual results:* Problem is still here  *Additional info:* _plenum/server/replica.py_ Status can be occasionally equal to PP_CHECK_TO_PRIMARY  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The goals are  1) To find out the 'stability boundaries', that is how many treads (clients) and nodes in the pool we may have for a correct and stable work and when we start facing stability issues.  2) Measure performance based on the number of clients and nodes in the pool.  Â   *Things to be tested:* 1. Set up the large pool. 2. Run load test with 1 thread writing. 3. Reset the pool. 4. Run load test with greater amount of threads. 5. Repeat steps 3-4 until problems like INDY-1180 will reproduce.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA If one tries to create a Sovrin RC, then the deb package will be successfully published to RC deb repo for QA validation. However, the next step in the pipeline (publishing to GitHub) will fail, since evernym-ci doesn't have permissions in GitHub anymore. As a result, the next steps in the pipeline for QA approval and copying RC deb to Stable are not available. One will have to copy the deb package from RC to Stable manually for this release.  *Acceptance criteria:* * Either find a way to publish to GitHub correctly or remove this step  ></description> </Issue>

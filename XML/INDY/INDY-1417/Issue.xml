CDATA *Story* As an administrator of a node on an Indy network, I want an automatic process for new client connections to be accepted by the network.  *Acceptance Criteria* Design a process by which new client connections can be accepted even when there are a lot of connections on the existing external NIC. The process must not require manual intervention.  The process may happen on a periodic basis.  *Notes* Potential approaches: * Force ZeroMQ to close connections on a timeout * An external process such as a firewall monitors the length of open connections and kills them on a timeout * * When the connection buffer becomes full, clear the connection buffer and force legitimate clients to reconnect   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~vladimir.demcak  Thank you for raising the issue. Since pool-restart command doesn't require consensus, it looks like that new nodes haven't been added properly (so that they don't see client requests). Can you please provide log files (/var/log/) or the full output of validator info?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~ashcherbakov  Thanks for your comment! Sorry for my late reply.  It looks like I had non-accessible (invalid) IP address due typo for client on the new nodes and because of this the client was not able to send the restart request to the new nodes.  However while I was debugging the issue I found another weird behavior .  1. start 4 genesis nodes {code:java} pool_start.sh 4 {code} 2. add 4 new nodes as     a) docker container     b) add new node to pool with steward.  the output should look like: !image-2019-12-11-10-37-05-654.png! 3. Remove genesis nodes with Trustee: {code:java} ledger node target=Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv alias=Node1 services= ledger node target=8ECVSk179mjsjKRLWiQtssMLgp6EPhWXtaYyStWPSGAb alias=Node2 services= ledger node target=DKVxG2fXXTU8yT5N7hGEbXB3dfdAnYv1JczDUHpmDxya alias=Node3 services= ledger node target=4PS3EDQ3dW1tci1Bp6543CfuuebjFrg36kLAUcskGfaA alias=Node4 services= {code} the output should look like: !image-2019-12-11-10-38-10-228.png! 4. Add new node without running docker container (physically the node will not be running)   so only "b) add new node to pool with steward." the output should look like:  !image-2019-12-11-10-40-54-926.png!  (Everything should work correctly. Eg creating new schema) 5. Add new node with docker container and steward (with current pool transactions - output from "read_ledger --type pool") will add the node to the pool     a) docker container     b) add new node to pool with steward.  *Test: try to add new schema:*  {code:java} pool(sandbox):wallet(wallet):did(V4S...e6f):indy> ledger schema version=1.0 attr_names=undergrad,last_name,first_name,birth_date,postgrad,expiry_date name=Degree2 Transaction response has not been received {code} !image-2019-12-11-10-44-33-206.png!    For some reason ViewChange has been executed.  I am adding logs for all nodes:  ^debug.zip       ></body> </Action>

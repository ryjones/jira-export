CDATA *Triage* Currently validator_info shows average throughput from node start time, so this behaviour is expected. If throughput measurement with smaller time window is needed then there should be a separate task describing requirements. Also we already have windowed throughput measurements in monitor for write requests, so if requirements match this implementation fix will be relatively easy.  ></body> </Action>

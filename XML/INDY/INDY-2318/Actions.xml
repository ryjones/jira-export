CDATA Issue Cause: * Node 3 was re-sending some messages after it got Pong from Node1 * While re-sending, it realized (on `isConnected` check) that connection is lost * So, the next message to be re-sent was added to the original list of messages * So, we started to try re-sending the same message over and over again  Â   Fix: * Remove custom re-sending logic since ZMQ should take care about this for us  PR: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1441   Recommendation for QA: * make sure the issue is not reproduced in system tests dealing with reconnections, adding/promoting/demoting nodes.  ></body> </Action>

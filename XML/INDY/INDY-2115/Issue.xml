CDATA We need to: * Make node build state proofs for GET_REVOC_REG_DELTA for the period of time when node did not exist. We can take such a proofs as first bls signed state. * Decide together with SDK side how to handle GET_REVOC_REG_DELTA, when "from" timestamp points to absence of REG_ENTRY. Especially, how to build proofs for such a case. * Extend tests with above cases (test_state_proof_returned_for_get_revoc_reg_delta)  ></description> </Issue>

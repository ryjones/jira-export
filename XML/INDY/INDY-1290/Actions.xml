CDATA Considering experience of other projects:  1. Fabric doesn't have PBFT implementation now, although it does state that they have plans for implementing it: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/orderer Also Fabric had PBFT implementation two years ago (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/0addcfb1e574e6a18f1e87b4a0282f9a57a17843/consensus/pbft), but it was dumped later. What's interesting is that while it did have view change implementation in separate module apparently it wasn't covered by tests.  2. Sawtooth doesn't have RBFT implementation now, although they plan to implement it, furthermore they plan to use Indy project as a reference: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1131 Also I found interesting PR with high-level overview of different consensus algorithms and proposal of generic consensus API to make them pluggable: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/4/files  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Considering follow-the-leader DDOS attack - one way to mitigate it could be making algorithm of choosing next primary unpredictable. It could be as follows: 1) nodes use multi-peer DH protocol to obtain common secret _key_ 2) for some _viewNo_ we can obtain primary node _id = hash(concat(key, viewNo)) mod N_ where _hash_ is some cryptographic hash function, and _N_ is total number of nodes This will prevent attacker from knowing which node will be next primary unless some malicious node cooperates with him and shares secret key.  ></body> </Action>

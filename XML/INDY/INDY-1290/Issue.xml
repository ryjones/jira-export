CDATA We found some issues with existing View Change. We need to implement it in a proper way as defined in PBFT: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thesis-mcastro.pdf.  See details in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1080  Please take the following requirements into consideration: * We need to take into account RBFT and 3PC batching specific * Have a look at the Fabric's PBFT experience and Sawtooth's RBFT one: INDY-1290 * The new View Change must be a pluggable strategy  * State machine needs to be used * PBFT viewchange is more conservative. So this could be more succeptible to follow-the-leader DDOS attacks. We need to take this into account * We need to have a suite of aggressive real-world simulation tests where we hammer the protocol such that we can quickly be confident we've improved without deploying. * We need to prove that the new implementation is better by executing the tests written in the scope of INDY-1296  ></description> </Issue>

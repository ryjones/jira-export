CDATA h3. *Problem reason*  **We had a test, which create a new Trustee by default Trustee, then new trustee create a steward and default trustee try to demote it. According to rules  auth_rules|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/auth_rules.md  this action should be performed.  h3. *Test describing*  This test sent NYM transction for demote steward using verkey field inside. In this case, from indy-node's side, we try to change field ROLE to None and field VERKEY from previous value to the same. But KeyRotation operation requeres that actor must owner of this NYM and corresponded error will be raised. For case, if verkey field is not presented in NYM txn, then, from indy-node's side, actor is trying to change field ROLE to None and this operation will be performed, because TRUSTEE can demote any STEWARDs. Previously, if we sent a NYM txn with the same ROLE and VERKEY field as in ledger, then we got 'REPLY' that means, that 'all fine' and write txn was performed, but it's wrong.  h3. *Resume*  If we want to perform demote as described in ticket, then we should send NYM txn without verkey field.      ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.755  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add new Trustee by default Trustee. 2. Add Steward by new Trustee. 3. Remove role from Steward by default Trustee.  Actual Results: {'op': 'REJECT', 'reqId': 1547466365636457443, 'reason': "client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest('actor must be owner',)", 'identifier': 'V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f'}  Expected Results: Roles adding and removing should be performed according to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/auth_rules.md  Additional Info: We have the same issue with new NETWORK_MONITOR role so it looks like the whole roles' logic should be fixed.  For QA: Implement system test according to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/auth_rules.md to validate this ticket and run during acceptance testing (manually / in CD).  ></description> </Issue>

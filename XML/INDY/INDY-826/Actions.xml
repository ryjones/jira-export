<Action id="30737" issue="20731" author="krw910" type="comment" body="The instructions look correct. The guide does say that you need to have setup the demo agents, but does not tell you where to do that if you have not followed the setup in the section using the vagrant scripts. Maybe we need to explain better where that setup is located." created="2017-09-11 19:14:13.0" updateauthor="krw910" updated="2017-09-11 19:14:13.0"/>

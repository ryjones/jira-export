CDATA *Case 1:*  +Reason of the break:+  From 23:31 to 00:00 all nodes restarted because can't allocate memory. The gap between nodes restarting was insufficient to ending catchup.  Explored in INDY-1493  +Reason for non-recovery:+  Logs are not enough. We can see messages with processing view_change_done but can not see with sending because have not logs between 22:25 and 22:44. On ViewChange 12 -> 14 most of the nodes lost logs. In this time they sent view_change_done, but after 22:44 they are not in a view change and have not a primary.   *Case 2:*  +Reason of the break:+  18 Jul from 16:34 to 17:25 all nodes restarted with ZMQ error "Address already in use". The gap between nodes restarting was insufficient to ending catchup.  Fixed in INDY-1431  +Reason for non-recovery:+  On 17:33 load test was switch off and pool had no an opportunity to recover.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA This may cause an issue with adding new nodes to the existing live pool. We are going to test the scenario by upgrading a pool from 1.0.28 to 1.1.37 then adding a new node that was not upgraded, but has a fresh install of 1.1.37.  We believe that even if the ledger does not get populated when the node starts that it will do a catch-up with the pool and sync its ledgers. If this is not the case this becomes the highest priority ticket.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Retest this with the settings from below to see if a fresh pool works. Then try again with the upgrade scenario from 1.1.28 to 1.1.37 adding a new node.  This may not be an issue with a fresh new pool. You just change the override setting from  domainTransactionsFile = 'transactions_live' to  domainTransactionsFile = 'domain_transactions_live'  ></body> </Action>

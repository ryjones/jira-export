CDATA ashcherbakov commented on Jun 7 I think instruction from Evernym.com is very outdated. There is no sovrin-client repo. If you want to have indy-node (and indy-plenum) for development and local running of tests, then please follow the instructions from  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/setup-dev.md   If you just want to run a pool, then you can use Docker:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool   ></body> </Action>

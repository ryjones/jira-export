CDATA It's blocked by INDY-727. We should resolve squash issue in stable before we can simplify RC creation. We can not trust any automatic tool to resolve conflicts when merging to stable.  Thoughts for future: * Automatically drop -dev postfix in setup py * Pull Jenkins API periodically to automatically create the next cascading PR when a one in the upstream is merged in (create a PR to indy-node when indy-plenum is merged and built) * Analyze diff to automatically rename any new migration scripts in it  ></body> </Action>

What we need to do  We need to add more unit/integration tests for pluggable request handlers. New handlers and common managers are independent and can be covered by unit tests as well. After integration it into indy-plenum and indy-node source code we can create a couple of integration tests.  Need to create before integration: * unit tests for DatabaseManager * unit tests for Write/Read/Action managers * unit tests for batch handlers  Â   ></body> </Action>

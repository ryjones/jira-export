CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.760  Steps to Reproduce: 0. Send nym txn to domain ledger. 1. Send node txn to pool ledger. 2. Send pool config txn to config ledger with {"force":false,"writes":true} parameters (that doesn't change pool working capacity). 3. Send another nym txn to domain ledger. 4. Repeat steps 0-3 two times.  Actual Results: First 0-3 steps run works, but we get PoolLedgerTimeout at step 2 during second 0-3 steps run and PoolLedgerTimeout at step 0 during third 0-3 steps run.  Expected Results: This sequence should work any number of times and should not break the pool.  Client's and nodes' logs:  ></description> </Issue>

Are we sure this was a clean environment after running the clear_node.py. Yes, /var/lib/indy folder is empty after running the script.  bq. Also, what are we trying to accomplish with this test? What are we simulating? I ran this test to determine possible problems in implementation of tree algorithms without influence of interaction with hard drive/ssd (see INDY-1050 for additional info) and to check the performance loss between in-memory ledger and leveldb ledger node's modes (so maybe some leveldb optimizations will be needed if this loss will be significant).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA No, this is not an issue for real pools, as they will always run in leveldb, not in memory, mode.  This should be fixed just to have some performance testing (we would like to have performance testing with InMemory vs. Leveldb ledgers to compare).  So, this is not a critical ticket. I will change the label from Stability to Node Performance.  ></body> </Action>

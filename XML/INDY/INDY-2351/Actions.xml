CDATA *PoA* * Find options for Indy txns on top of Stellar ** Research how to create immutable records in Stellar ** Research off-ledger validation options for Indy txns ** Come up with ideas how to implement revocation without on-chain validation * Light clients for Stellar ** Find out how block signing is implemented (or if it is implemented at all) in Stellar. Looking for "catch up" implementation should help. ** If there are no block signatures - research options for adding them in a federated network ** Research current implementation of Stellar state, find out whether it is possible to reduce it to simple key-value storage (or at least its part responsible for storing immutable records) ** Come up with a PoA and rough estimate for implementing light client in Stellar  ></body> </Action>

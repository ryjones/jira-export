CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * Create a new command GET_VALIDATOR_STATUS * Create a new role `observer` to be able to send this command (so that not everyone can do it, but it's not necessary to be a Steward)  * a NYM with a `observer` role can be created by Trustees and Stewards * The reply should be quite similar to GET_VALIDATOR_INFO one, but should not contain information about machines running the code.  ></description> </Issue>

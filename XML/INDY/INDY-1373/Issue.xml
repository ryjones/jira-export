CDATA Main problem with processing logs is that it's very long CPU-bound (and sometimes memory-bound) task. Also, downloading logs from pool to process them locally takes a lot of time.  If we could run log processor on large 25-nodes test pool directly we: - effectively get 50 cores and 200 Gb of RAM to process logs, which is much more than any desktop have - can get results before downloading all logs, which takes time  In order to do this we need: - remove dependency on matplotlib from log processor - create ansible playbook to upload log processor and its config to pool, run it in pool and then download results  ></description> </Issue>

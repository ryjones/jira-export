<Action id="30718" issue="20641" author="andkononykhin" type="comment" body="Done. Actually I created this task because I needed to link my reports with JIRA for reporting about such kind of work I did for the latest release. Usually it includes review of changes in master from, making git merge with possible exclusions of some commits and creating pull requests to stable for plenum and node. I see two options here: create such task in each sprint or use one for all sprints." created="2017-09-11 09:56:20.0" updateauthor="andkononykhin" updated="2017-09-11 09:56:20.0"/>

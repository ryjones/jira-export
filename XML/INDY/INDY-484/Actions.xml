CDATA We need to confer with  ~mgbailey  and  ~tharmon  and  ~krw910  on this. All of them have important experience trying to troubleshoot and diagnose based on current logs.  The simplest thing we could do that would vastly improve the value of our logs is to stop issuing "suspicious spike" messages that flood the logs. It may be the case that a brief investment (say, a day) could yield important improvements.  We should not spend a long time on this ticketâ€“just a modest amount.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA What will be helpful to know from the logs easily from my point of view: - current viewNo - current primary for each replica - catchup statuses - view change statuses - PRE-PREPARE, PREPARE, COMMIT times (probably not in INFO?) - Order (commit to the Ledger) time  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mgbailey  We did some changes in log levels recently (in the scope of INDY-1187). So we are hoping this is better now even on INFO level. We will most probably continue the work on adapting the logs in the background during analysis of logs and running load tests.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mgbailey  The problem with this story is that it is too vague. The team feels like they have been through the effort multiple times, and if they are not addressing the underlying need then more guidance is necessary. I can help gather requirements, but we should do that in the context of new issues with clear requirements based on research with a range of customers.  We created INDY-1274, which reflects your biggest pain point. This is prioritized to be completed as soon as possible.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA See the related defect INDY-179,  The "*show <file>"* command does not support tabbing like a linux shell does, which means you have to know in advance where the file resides. To do that you have to get back to the linux file system. User could then very well use linux based editors like VI or NANO or others to read this file. Hence this command is redundant and not of much use.            ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Demote a single backup primary (replica). It is important to note that this effectively reduces the consensus pool by 1 (i.e. from 10 to 9). The pool's "f_value" and "Count_of_replicas" are based on validator pool size. Expect the next node in the round robin to become a new replica.  Start a 10 validator node pool with the following Primary and Replica configuration: Node1:0 - Primary Node2:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if node 1 goes down or a view change is requested) Node3:2 - Backup to node 2 Node4:3 - Backup to node 3  Demote Node4 and expect Node5 to become a new replica.  Node1:0 - Primary Node2:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if Node1 goes down (causes view change) or a view change is requested) Node3:2 - Backup to Node2 Node5:3 - Backup to Node3  If Node3 is demoted:  Demote Node3 and expect Node5 to become a new replica.  Node1:0 - Primary Node2:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if Node1 goes down (causes view change) or a view change is requested) Node4:2 - Backup to Node2 Node5:3 - Backup to Node4  The experiment should be written in a way that it could be run over and over again (perpetual) w/o the need to reset the cluster. Therefore, "Demote the last replica and expect the next node in round robin to be selected" is more accurate.  ></description> </Issue>

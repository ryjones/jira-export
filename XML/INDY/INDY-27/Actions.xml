CDATA My understanding is a new Validator cannot just be added to the system. Only a Steward can approve addition of a new Validator to the system. Without which a new node will not have the keys to establisy a ED25519 encrypted session with the pool  This defect is still a definite possiblility but to be able to do that a already trusted Validator needs to be compromized first and then the python code on the Validator needs to be patched so that it can carry out a DOS attack on other NODES  It is also possibel that the process of vetting the Steward is compromised in either case we need to find a solution to this problem  Â   ></body> </Action>

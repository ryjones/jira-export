CDATA A test leads to nodes have different prepared certificates, eg. in a 4 node scenario, here f+1 nodes have one prepared certificate and another f+1 nodes have a different prepared certificate.   {code} 2017-06-24 15:38:32,204 | DEBUG    | replica.py           (425) | on_view_change_start | Gamma:0 setting last prepared for master to (1, 4) 2017-06-24 15:38:32,219 | DEBUG    | replica.py           (425) | on_view_change_start | Delta:0 setting last prepared for master to (1, 3) 2017-06-24 15:38:32,238 | DEBUG    | replica.py           (425) | on_view_change_start | Alpha:0 setting last prepared for master to (1, 4) 2017-06-24 15:38:32,256 | DEBUG    | replica.py           (425) | on_view_change_start | Beta:0 setting last prepared for master to (1, 3) {code}  A possible solution to this after a few catchup rounds, any prepared certificates get rejected. Or we build the capability to request 3PC message which is the correct thing to do  ></description> </Issue>

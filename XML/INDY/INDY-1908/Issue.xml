CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.728  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run reading and writing load test against 25 nodes pool. 2. Force VCs by primaries restarting each 5-10 minutes. 3. Reset View to 0 by the whole pool restarting. 4. Stop the load test. 5. Stop 1..6 nodes to start long VC process. 6. Send pool restart and pool upgrade (to the same version with reinstall) txns to ledger (successfully). 7. Run reading and writing load test again. 8. Start 1..6 nodes (they don't catch up under load). 9. Stop the load test. 10. Check 1..6 nodes for catch-up (1,4,6 nodes don't catch up). 11. Restart 1,4,6 nodes.  Actual Results: 2,3,5 nodes catch up one by one (not together) and make it slowly (about 1.5..2 hours to catch up form 25k to 40k for 3 nodes). 1,4,6 nodes don't catch up until restart and also it takes about the same time (1..1.5 hours) to catch up.  All logs and validator-info are in ev@evernymr33:logs/catchup_12_12_2018.tar.gz  Expected Results: Catch-up should perform faster and all nodes should catch up successfully.   ></description> </Issue>

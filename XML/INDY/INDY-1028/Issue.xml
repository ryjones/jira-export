CDATA We need to support fully qualified DIDs in the form `did:sov:<value>`, not just `<value>`. * If we see just <value>, we can assume the prefix is “did:sov:”  * If we see a prefix that isn’t “did:sov:“, we can potentially raise an error about an unsupported DID type.  Note that some DID formats may make different assumptions than Sovrin does about the length of a DID, whether it is case-sensitive, etc. We need to get in the habit of thinking of DIDs as being fully qualified. Our sample files should show this. Our wallet APIs should handle it. Etc. This is the foundation for us being able to have a single wallet/agent/agency that supports DIDs from the production Sovrin ledger as well as a test network--and it is the foundation for eventual interop with other ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  ></description> </Issue>

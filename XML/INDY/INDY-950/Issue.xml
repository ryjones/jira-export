CDATA While attempting to install the RC using {code:java} apt-get install -y debsigs debsig-verify apt-transport-https dialog figlet python-pip python3-pip python3.5-dev libsodium18 python3-indy-crypto=0.1.6 sovrin {code} we fail with the error "sovrin : Depends: indy-node but it is not going to be installed"  Tracing the error back to its source, I see that there is a dependency on python3-indy-crypto  version 0.1.6 that is not being met.  This version is in the rc repo, but it is not the most recent version.  There are also versions 0.1.6-6 and 1.1.6-7, which seem to be interfering with the ability of apt to find the correct package.  These versions only exist in the rc branch.  We do not have this same problem in the master branch.  If the above line is modified to include the package information for python3-indy-crypto, then the package installation succeeds: {code:java} apt-get install -y debsigs debsig-verify apt-transport-https dialog figlet python-pip python3-pip python3.5-dev libsodium18 python3-indy-crypto=0.1.6 python3-indy-crypto=0.1.6 sovrin {code} It should not be necessary to include package version information on dependencies during installation.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *PoA:*  We've integrated almost all tests from indy-node folder in previous tasks. Cli tests mainly have been left in indy-client folder. Some of them (cli specific) we need to mark as deprecated, cause we will delete them in future tickets. Some of them (with common for cli and sdk logic) must be integrated with sdk and transferred to indy-node folder.  To deprecate:  indy-client/test/training/*  indy-client/test/agent/*  indy-client/test/client/*  indy-client/test/cli/ (part of it)  To integrate:  indy-client/test_nym_attrib  indy-client/test/anoncreds/*  indy-client/test/state_proof/*  indy-node/indy_node/test/did/*  indy-client/test/cli/ (part of it)  ></body> </Action>

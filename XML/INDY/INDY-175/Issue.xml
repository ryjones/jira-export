CDATA Build Info: sovrin-node 0.3.19 sovrin-client 0.3.20  Overview: Add verkey and update verkey commands don't work.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add new key identifier. 2. Login as Trustee and add initial verkey to new identifier. 3. Login as new identifier by its key and update its own verkey.  Actual Results: Command "list ids with verkeys" returns incorrect verkeys (they differ from verkeys returned by "send GET_NYM"). Update verkey command (by its owner) throws not user-friendly error (screenshot) and doesn't work.  Expected Results: Add verkey and update verkey commands should add and update verkey respectively. All errors due to this commands execution should be human-readable.  Additional info: This issue blocks complex confirmation of INDY-110.   ></description> </Issue>

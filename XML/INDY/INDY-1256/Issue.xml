CDATA We lost the ability to post transactions to the STN ledger.  Looking in the logs, a view change, cause unknown, occurred on all the nodes that I have access to at March 30, 02:42 GMT.  The last transaction posted to the ledger is timestamped 1522356428, which is March 29, 20:47. I have access to 7 of 10 nodes, and their logs are attached.   At 17:16 GMT I restarted the indy-node service on those nodes and saw that in the view change the original primary was restored, and I was again able to post transactions.   Please analyze the attached logs, and determine insofar as is possible: * What caused the view change? * Why were we unable to post transactions? * Following the restart, were all 10 of the nodes participating in consensus? ** The nodes that did not restart are NewtonD, RFCU, and ibm  Secondary questions: * Were there attempts to post transactions to the ledger before the view change that failed? * When did the fault state begin, where transactions were not posting? * Did the view change cause the lack of consensus, and why would it?  ></description> </Issue>

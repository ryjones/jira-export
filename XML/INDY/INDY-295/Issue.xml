CDATA In the ESN, we have a node that regularly experiences disconnects. All the other nodes seem to be up consistently, but this one node is often having trouble.  The same phenomenon is true of the Alpha network.  There is logic in our monitoring plugin where a given node can report problemsâ€“but to my knowledge we don't have any feature where all the other nodes will say, "Hey, node X is constantly going down. Let's complain about it." We want such problems to become obvious without us proactively scouring the logs ourselves.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I've done some initial testing and it appears to work just fine... it will upload the log files to /home/ubuntu/logs on 34.225.141.74.   The script has some variables at the top to easily edit and change things like the location of the public ssh key (*rpkey*), the username to log in with (*ruser*), the ip of the host (*rhost*) the destination for the logs (*rdir*), the username whose home directory contains the log files.    The script as well as a file that can be dropped into */etc/cron.d* are attached.    NOTE  the cron file assumes that the location of the script is */home/sovrin/sovrin-log-xfer.sh*   Set up should be a simple as: # Place *sovrin-logger.pem* and *sovrin-log-xfer.sh* into */home/sovrin* # Ensure that that *sovrin-logger.pem* and *sovrin-log-xfer.sh* are owned by the sovrin user: *chown sovrin /home/sovrin/sovrin-** # Place *sovrin-logger* into */etc/cron.d* as root, and owned by root with *chown root.root /etc/cron.d/sovrin_logger*. # Change the permissions on the *.pem* file with *chmod 600 sovrin-logger.pem*. # Make sure that *sovrin-log-xfer.sh* is executable with *chmod a+rx* *sovrin-log-xfer.sh.*  ></body> </Action>

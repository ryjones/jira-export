CDATA We have some technical overview and documentation: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/docs  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/main.md  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/docs   Most of the docs there are just markdown documents describing the concepts and workflows in text.  It would be great to also have some diagrams (sequence, relationship, use cases, etc.).  Examples of diagrams that we may have: * Request ordering by a Node and replicas (validation, 3PC batch creation, 3PC protocol, BLS multi-sigs), see  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/request_handling.md  ** write requests (txns) ** read requests (queries) * View Change * CatchUp, see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/catchup.md * Checkpoints * Monitoring * State Proofs and BLS multi-sigs              ></description> </Issue>

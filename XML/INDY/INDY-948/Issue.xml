CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.206  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start pool of 4 nodes. 2. Force 4 view changes (so new primary is the 1st node again). 3. Add the 5th node. 4. Send some NYMs. 5. Force 4 view changes (so new primary is the 5st node). 6. Add the 6th node. 7. Check ledger and log on the 6th node.  Actual Results: The 6th node isn't catched up with other 5 nodes. There is a trace log in `systemctl status indy-node` and in journalctl.  Expected Result: The 6th node should work the same as the 5th node after adding.  ></description> </Issue>

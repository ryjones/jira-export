CDATA INDY-20 told us that we crash if a ledger record is corrupted.  I want us not to crash when we encounter a ledger record that we cannot read. We could ignore it, or we could at a minimum exit cleanly while printing a message about which record is corrupt, with a suggestion that one way to fix the problem is to rebuild the ledger.  Ideally, a node that gets into this state should still start and run, just so it can receive POOL_UPGRADE transactions that allow it to get new software that is more capable of dealing with the corruption (maybe a migration script would reset or fix the corruption).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA  ~nage   ~danielhardman  we have an issue with upgrades if we support multiple networks for a node. Say, our network A uses indy-node 1 and our network B uses the same indy-node A. Then an upgrade transaction is issued in network A to upgrade to indy-node 2. The upgrade was a success. We switch to network B, where all nodes use old indy-node 1. As result of the upgrade which could have brought incompatible changes out node can no longer participate in consensus. We should either prohibit using several netwroks for a node (it's still possible for a client though) or implement multiple netwroks via virtualization (like docker).  Of course, we still have an option of putting a constraint "all networks should depend on the same version of indy-node", but I do not really like it: we prohibit using a major feature of our system.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA also please note   script generate_indy_pool_transaction now has a new argument --network ("sandbox" by default)  this parameter generates genesis transactions for the specified network only and place all the file to network specific folder.  after the script run you need to set desired network in /ect/indy/indy_config.py  ></body> </Action>

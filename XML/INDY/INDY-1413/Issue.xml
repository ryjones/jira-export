CDATA nsdiff was written during the transition from levelDB to rockDB and was written fairly quickly.      Because of this, there are a few areas that overly complex and easy to maintain. This tech debt was incurred to keep the project moving forward.      This ticket is to revisit nsdiff and remove complexity when more time and resource are available.      The main area that should be refactored is the detection, reading and diffing of DB files or directories.   the "transform_db" function is a prime example and should be reviewed.     nsdiff was written by  ~ckochenower   ></description> </Issue>

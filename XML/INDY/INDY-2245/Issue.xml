CDATA *Problem description*  Rollback script does not remember versions of packages installed on the system, but it depends on strict versions of dependencies specified in the packages it tries to rollback.  This may lead to some problems during the rollback process, when some packages were manually updated, when some packages are removed (like sovtoken), when we are dealing with older packages that do not have strict dependencies, or when some newer packages were installed during upgrade but the upgrade failed after that.  *Acceptance Criteria*  Explicitly save versions of all packages, taking the snapshot of a state of the system at the moment of the upgrade and revert to that state  ></description> </Issue>

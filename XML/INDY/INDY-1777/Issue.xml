CDATA As was understood in INDY-1686, ZMQ may consume a lot of memory if there are a lot of simultaneous client requests, since it uses round-robin to read client queues.  Plenum does (be default) 100 reads in one looper run.  We need to test if situation with memory consumption improves when we restrict the number of client connections.  ></description> </Issue>

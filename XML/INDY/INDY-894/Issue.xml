CDATA Update the Getting Started Guide with correct verbiage changes. With the branding changes that have taken place, it appears that everywhere "Sovrin" once appeared "Indy" has now been replaced. This has caused contextual problems.  Example: Title page states "A Developer Guide from the Indy Foundation"   There is no "Indy Foundation". There is a Sovrin Foundation and a Linux Foundation. Indy is a project of Hyperledger.   Review the contents of the Getting Started Guide for necessary changes such as these.   ></description> </Issue>

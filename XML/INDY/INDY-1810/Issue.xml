CDATA tomdavidson commented on Sep 9, 2016 @jasonalaw Thank you for the presentation and discussion at BYU OIT today.  Using Plenum/ledger outside of Sovrin might accomplish some of your outreach goals. For example, I'm after a distributed, append only, and ordered, object repository (avoiding rdbms) to use as an event store. More docs would be nice, esspeically comparted to the some of the hyperledger project's docs.  ></description> </Issue>

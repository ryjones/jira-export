CDATA One validator had additional transactions written to its ledger, which were not on the ledgers of the other validators in the provisional pool.  These transactions appear to be duplicates of transactions that were previously on the pool.  The time stamps on the excess transactions are all the same, at a time on Feb. 2nd.  Unfortunately this is long enough ago that there are no logs available to give additional context.  However, a problem like this was seen with the metis node some time ago on the STN.  We need to confirm a the fix was correctly implemented.  Attached are ledgers for zaValidator, the node that experienced the issue.  In addition, ledgers for ev1, which is in sync with the rest of the pool, are included for reference.  Note that in this case, the ledger upgraded several days before the time stamp on the duplicate transactions.  ></description> </Issue>

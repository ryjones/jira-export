CDATA We discussed this at some length. The use case of a credential issuer contracting with a processor to issue the credentials is an important one which we want to be successful. However, we don't think the approach in this story is the best way to achieve that goal.  We want the ledger to be as dumb as possible, and is not the right place to record the relationship between an issuer and a processor. Recording this information on the ledger complicates the system and introduces an additional (though probably small) risk of correlation.  Delegation is a key management issue, and should be governed off of the ledger by legally enforceable contracts between the verifier and the processor. The contract should enforce the terms of the relationship, and the issuer is responsible for maintaining the records necessary to audit the issuance of their credentials.  However, we recognize that the ledger could help enforce these relationships. We will continue to investigate the right way to do this, and when we have a plan we will raise separate issues.  ></body> </Action>

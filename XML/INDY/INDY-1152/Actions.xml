CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.3.308 indy-plenum 1.2.248  Steps to Validate: 1. Shut down node by `systemctl stop indy-node`. 2. Check logs for "Looper shut down in <seconds num> seconds". 3. Start node back. 4. Change node code to raise KeyError serially. 5. Check logs and journalctl for node restarting due to raised KeyError.  Actual Results: There is "Looper shut down in <seconds num> seconds" entry in logs on node shutdown. Node starts after KeyError-based shutdown successfully. !INDY-1152.PNG|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

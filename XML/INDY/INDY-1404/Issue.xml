CDATA In  INDY-1350|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1350  and  INDY-1400|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1400  it was found that next big problem with view change is that it can interrupt catchup process, leaving partially catched up state which leads to problems with applying batches that contain some transactions that were received through catch up.  Simplest possible fix looks like disabling ability to interrupt catch up by external events.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Version Information* indy-node 1.6.73  indy-plenum 1.6.51  indy-anoncreds 1.0.11  sovrin 1.1.17   *Major Fixes* INDY-1583 - Pool stopped writing after F change INDY-1645 - read_ledger passes incorrectly formatted stdout and breaks convention INDY-1595 - Node can't catch up large ledger INDY-1603 - Validator Info may hang for a couple of minutes INDY-1548 - read_ledger tool is not able to read the sovrin plugin ledger  *Changes and Additions* INDY-1642 - 3PC Batch should preserve the order of requests when applying PrePrepare on non-primary INDY-1643 - Monitor needs to take into account requests not passing dynamic validation when trigerring view change INDY-1565 - Improve throughput calculation to reduce a chance of false positive View Changes INDY-1660 - Performance of monitor should be improved INDY-1588 - As a Steward, I need to have a script that can generate Proof of possession for my BLS key, so that I can use this value in a NODE txn INDY-1389 - Support Proof of Possession for BLS keys INDY-1582 - Do not use average when calculating total throughput/latency of backups INDY-1564 - Discard any client requests during view change INDY-1568 - As a developer I need a simple tool to show graphical representation of some common metrics INDY-1549 - Change default configs for better performance and stability  *Known Issues* INDY-1447 - Upgrade failed on pool from 1.3.62 to 1.4.66 (!) Note that INDY-1447 was fixed in indy-node 1.5.68, but it still presents in indy-node 1.3.62 and 1.4.66 code. So, *some of the nodes may not to be upgraded during simultaneous pool-upgrade*. If this problem will appear, stewards should perform manual upgrade of indy-node in accordance with this instruction:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUvbioL5OsmZMSkwRcu0p0jdttJO5VS8K3GhDLdNaoI  (!) To reduce the risk of reproducing INDY-1447, it is *recommended to use old CLI for pool upgrade*.  (!) *Pool upgrade from indy-node 1.3.62 to indy-node 1.6.73 should be performed simultaneously for all nodes due to txn format changes.* (!) *There must be sovrin package upgrade to 1.1.17 version after indy-node package upgrade. You need to specify package=sovrin in pool-upgrade command to do this.*  (!) *All indy-cli pools should be recreated with actual genesis files.* (i) *For more details about txn format changes see INDY-1421.* (i) *There are possible OOM issues during 3+ hours of target load or large catch-ups at 8 GB RAM nodes pool so 32 GB is recommended.*  ></description> </Issue>

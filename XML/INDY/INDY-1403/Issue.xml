CDATA If node receives catchup replies from different nodes with overlapping seqNo intervals there is a possibility that one of replies will not be validated properly and node will be blacklisted. It could happen because node applying txns from sorted list containing merged txns from all CRs based on first CR that includes starting seqNo. If starting seqNo is not the first seqNo of the CR the node will apply more txns than CR contains and proofs will not match  ></description> </Issue>

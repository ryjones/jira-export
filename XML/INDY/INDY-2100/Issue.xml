In the indy-cli create a new did and provide a vanity did (any valid base58, 21 character string). for example: *did new did=AdamBurdett1111111111* next, in the indy-cli use a did in your wallet with permission to anchor nyms to a ledger, I used a TRUSTEE permission did. for example: *did use YLCJ5wri6K8asJnHdJXzDP* then, anchor the vanity did to the ledger with a nym transaction. for example: *ledger nym did=AdamBurdett1111111111 verkey=GAotUN1AdY7nfuSTSMh9vx7fF4oVPVRSoBEtW7RiQh1c role=TRUSTEE*  *Actual Results*: Nym request has been sent to Ledger. Metadata: |From|Sequence Number|Request ID|Transaction time| |YLCJ5wri6K8asJnHdJXzDP|50|1557437826392951500|2019-05-09 21:37:09|  Data: |Did|Verkey|Role| |AdamBurdett1111111111|GAotUN1AdY7nfuSTSMh9vx7fF4oVPVRSoBEtW7RiQh1c|TRUSTEE|  (Nym transaction was successful)  *Expected Results*: (Nym transaction was unsuccessful).  *Additional Information*: Vanity dids could be discouraged by having the ledger check if the did is part of the verkey. This would not allow vanity dids to be used without a computational expensive discovery process. This will come at a cost of not being able to anchor dids that have had their keys rotated.  ></description> </Issue>

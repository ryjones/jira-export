CDATA We have some concerns with this requirement: * By default, the DID is not explicitly passed and LibIndy generates the DID from the first 16 bytes of the verkey. If the user has explicitly passed a custom DID, we are nervous about restricting that.Â This appears to be a Sovrin specific requirement that will reduce the flexibility of the system and could break other users of Indy. * We have previous requirements to allow rotation of the verkey (INDY-290, INDY-827). Though we could do the check just on new DIDs which would prevent vanity DIDs and allow the verkey to be subsequently rotated. * Having a strong assumption that the DID matches the beginning of the verkey could allow some correlation. See https://allprivatekeys.com/vanity-address  We agree that best practice is to not have "vanity DIDs" on the ledger, but we consider this a documentation requirement (at least in the short term). We should get more feedback from the user community before deciding on this change.  ></body> </Action>

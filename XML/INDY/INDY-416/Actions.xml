CDATA My reading of this ticket is that there could be some sort of ledger status webpage where certain statistics are displayed that would allow people monitoring the network to draw conclusions about the health and status of the system relative to the trust framework.  In this case it is a proposal for a monitoring tool for detecting key compromise.Â  We should address this as a statistics logging/gathering mechanism first, and log new issues for some type of status page.  ></body> </Action>

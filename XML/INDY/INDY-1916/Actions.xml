CDATA As i understand from description, in the scope of this ticket we whould add new role, which named "NETWORK_MONITOR", with the next options: * User with this role can be added only by steward, that means, that we should add rule for _*adding*_ and _*deleting*_ new NYM with role "NETWORK_MONITOR" * User with this role can only perform a GET_VALIDATOR_INFO requests  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~esplinr , should we add a possibility to adding and deleting users with role NETWORK_MONITOR for TRUSTEE too? In other words, STEWARDs and TRUSTEEs can add and delete NYM with role "NETWORK_MONITOR".     ></body> </Action>

CDATA Thank you  ~anikitinDSR  for finding this mistake in the requirements. You are correct that TRUSTEES should also be able to create a NETWORK_MONITOR role. Both STEWARDs and TRUSTEEs should be able to create the role without requiring a second signature.  Your summary of the implementation plan matches my understanding. A STEWARD or TRUSTEE should be able to create a NYM with the role "NETWORK_MONITOR" to grant the ability, and should also be able to remove it.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA A concern was raised that adding this role centralizes maintenance of the network.  This role does not give privileged access to maintain the network. The name NETWORK_MONITOR is meant to communicate that it gives additional people the ability to monitor the network, whereas today only a STEWARD key can access validator-info.  When we better understand the implications of this monitoring on network performance and security, we might decide that this information should be available to anyone without a special role.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.757  Steps to Validate: 1. Need to check, that only TRUSTEE and STEWARD can create NYM with role "NETWORK_MONITOR". TRUST_ANCHOR for example can't do this. 2. Create user with role NETWORK_MONITOR and do get-validator-info action. Check that user with this role can do this and get the same info as STEWARD. 3. Check, that only TRUSTEE and STEWARD can delete user with NETWORK_MONITOR role (it means, that change "role" field from "NETWORK_MONITOR" to ""). 4. Check, that user with role "NETWORK_MONITOR" can't do other things like create other users with role "NETWORK_MONITOR", do restart or config actions.  Actual Results: New role works as expected (temporary test due to absent SDK support here: https://github.com/VladimirWork/tests/blob/f3196e77aef6c4e155098ad43e91971f317de09d/test_misc.py#L230-L332) New role is still not supported by libindy and indy-cli so this functionality will be retested in scope of IS-1123 by https://github.com/VladimirWork/tests/blob/f3196e77aef6c4e155098ad43e91971f317de09d/test_misc.py#L154-L226.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Some clarifications: * The NETWORK_MONITOR role should be created by any TRUSTEE or STEWARD, and can also be revoked by any TRUSTEE or STEWARD (not just the one that created it). * The role only allows running the get-validator-info command * The network can function without this role, so no deployment of an Indy network is required to use it. * We do not expect the scope of the NETWORK_MONITOR role to expand, but it could happen in future tickets.  My understanding of Vladimir's comment is that the current implementation reflects these expectations. If they do not, we should raise a new ticket (this one can continue to be considered "done").  ></body> </Action>

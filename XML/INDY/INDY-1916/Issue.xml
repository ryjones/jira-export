CDATA *Story* As a systems administrator responsible for solutions built on top of an Indy network, I want to be able to monitor the health of the network to ensure that my solutions will be reliable.  As a steward, I want to be able to setup network maintenance without having to use my steward keys in a dangerous manner.  Notes: * This user is not a steward on the network. * It is reasonable to require that this user has a trusted position on the network. * This user is very technical and motivated to build a monitoring system. * The monitoring system requires: ** The information returned by validator-info across the various stewards, but today this information is only available to users with a steward role. ** Other information that can be provided by querying the ledger. This does not require any changes.  *Acceptance Criteria* * A non-steward role exists by which a trusted administrator can access validator-info across all stewards in a consensus pool. * This role is called "Network Monitor". * The only permissions this role has beyond an unprivileged user is to access validator-info. * A user can be assigned this role by a steward (no multi-signature necessary).  ></description> </Issue>

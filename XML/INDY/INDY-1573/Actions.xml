CDATA According to logs, the issue may happen if there is a txn in old format (prior to 1.4) in the Ledger.  But the output of all ledgers shows that all txns in all Ledgers are in a valid new format ("txn" is present everywhere).  Are we sure that the issue is reproduced for Node3? Maybe we should get the output of all ledgers for all nodes...  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As one can see from the stacktrace, there is a missing "txn" field in a transaction got from the ledger. But attached output shows that all domain transactions on all nodes have "txn" field... (can be checked by `grep -c`)  Â   ></body> </Action>

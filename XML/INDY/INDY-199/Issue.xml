However, the request here is for a feature that&apos;s baked into the software itself, that periodically checks to see that all nodes can reach each other, and that complains when it finds an anomaly. The complaining could be logged, but it would be even better if it used the alerting mechanism that sends email, as with health monitoring." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-06-12 20:03:24.0" updated="2019-10-11 10:00:15.0" resolutiondate="2019-10-11 10:00:15.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="17795"/>

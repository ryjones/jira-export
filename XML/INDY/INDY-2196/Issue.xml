CDATA Currently we have set of pinned top level dependencies in both indy-plenum and indy-node. Transitional (dependencies of the dependencies)  dependencies' versions are not managed and might use fuzzy constraints.  Seems canonical repositories for LTS releases are rarely updated for python debian packages it doesn't lead to any observable issues (at least we haven't encountered them yet).  But in ubuntu 20.04 we likely would have new set of versions of that dependencies and that might shift the env.  The general idea is to fix testing env and recommend it for production usage as only one tested. Please refer to tasks INDY-1701 for more details. For python there was no standard way for that in the past but there were a set of options (INDY-1706). It might be different now.  The goal of the task is to make decision: # is it possible to keep the same dependency list (tree) on both platforms # dependencies versions for each (both)        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA indy-node 1.4.494 libindy 1.5.0~613  ></environment> <description><! CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup AWS acceptance pool of 6 nodes (4+2). 2. Set in indy_config.py. 3. Periodically run the load test with not very high load (~5 nyms/sec) during several days. => Domain ledger size is about 67K txns, viewNo is 164. 4. Run several force-view-change experiments. 5. Restart the pool. 6. Run several force-view-change experiments.  *Actual Results:* After one of force-view-change experiments one of the nodes (Node2) is lagged behind the others.  *Expected Results:* Nodes should be synchronized.  Logs and nscaptures:  https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/qanodelogs/indy-1470/   *Additional Information:* Lagged node was not able to write missed txns while it was without load and after writing of several txns. It wrote missed txns after restart the pool.  ></description> </Issue>

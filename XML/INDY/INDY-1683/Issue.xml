CDATA A backup replica should be switch off after quorum of INSTANCE_CHANGE messages on backup instance.  *Acceptance criteria:* - A strategy done in INDY-1682 should result in sending a special INSTANCE_CHANGE about instance change on backup instance X - Once node got a quorum (n-f) of instance changes on backup instance X, it switches off the replica (INDY-1680) - add tests to check correct replica switch off  - testing perfomance changes (shouldn't be worse then in taskÂ INDY-1682) after disconnect or degraded a backup primary node.  - testing memory consumption (should be better then in task INDY-1682)  ></description> </Issue>

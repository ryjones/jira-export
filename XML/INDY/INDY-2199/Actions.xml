CDATA *PoA:* * *Changes* ** If the number ofÂ  `signatures` with ENDORSER/STEWARD/TRUSTEE roles is greater than one, and the Author's DID doesn't have ENDORSER/STEWARD/TRUSTEE role, then check that Endorser field is specified. *** If there is just one signature in `signatures` field, then the current validation makes sure that this is the Author's signature, so no need to require Endorser field *** If Author's role is ENDORSER/STEWARD/TRUSTEE, then he or she doesn't require endorsement even in case of multi-sig, since it can be an action, requiring, for example, 3 TRUSRTEEs. ** Check that endorser's role is ENDORSER * *Where* ** In a new EndorserAuthorizer  ></body> </Action>

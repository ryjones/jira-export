CDATA After meeting with Daniel it was decided to move the issue to backlog.  All the urgent cases are covered by catchup, force upgrade, downgrade and reupgrade.     Also we discussed the case of slow ledger and possibility of transformation of new "stall" state into automatic readonly state.  All these cases are not important for now.     All the cases that probably requires the "stall" state should be added as comment to this issue and team discussed     CC  ~danielhardman   ~nage   ~ashcherbakov   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Problem reason: * Pool stopped working  Inverstigation: * Logs of this pool's run shows that pool doesn't write new txns because it cannot choose primary. ** It cannot choose primary because every node stuck in endless viewchange. ** Viewchange cannot successfully end because corresponding catchups endlessly repeating. ** Catchups cannot successfully end because node did not collect quorum of VIEW_CHANGE_DONE messages for current view_no. ** VIEW_CHANGE_DONE messages can't collect quorum in the right time, because endless catchup takes almost all the looper's time. ** That situation happens because of forcing view_change when another view_change is in progress. Actual Node correctly handle this behaviour. That was fixed in scope of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1454 * The reason why 2, 3 and 7 Nodes got ahead of other pool is uneven receiving of commit certificates (quorum of nodes got prepare certificate, but only 3 of them got commit certificates to order new txns).  Recommendations for QA:  * Try case of this ticket with actual node (1.5.551)  ></body> </Action>

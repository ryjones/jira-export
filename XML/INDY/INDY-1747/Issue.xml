CDATA Some observations: * growth is same for loads of 1 NYM/sec and 10 NYMs/sec (so it doesn't depend on number of transactions written, although it's likely to depend on number of batches ordered) * growth is same when using RocksDB and LevelDB as storage * maximum node-to-node message size grows as well, but not as fast * _average_ node prod time doesn't seem to be affected, which means spikes are in fact rare  In my opinion prime suspect here is cyclic garbage collector, but more research is needed.  *Acceptance criteria* - find out why max prod time grows - find out if this growth has upper bound - create issues for actual fix   ></description> </Issue>

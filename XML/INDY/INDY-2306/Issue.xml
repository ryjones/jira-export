CDATA Hey Guys  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=kiDMpGmDcTKvrwvcX  After this discussion with  ~ashcherbakov  he suggested creating a new Issue to talk about the 128 KB response limit of the Indy-Nodes. Because we think that the nodes have been only tested for the write-operations (where you don't have any problems with a maximum of 125 Attributes). But when you start reading the Data of the ledger you will get Metadata and some more crypto-stuff which ends up in a Timeout of the Nodes, because you can end up easily over that 128KB.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1) Create pool from 4 nodes, where node2 is primary 2) Stop indy-node service on node4 3) Stop indy-node service on node2 4) Send some NYM from client => There is no feedback from pool (consensus is lost) 5) Start indy-node service on node4 => "view change" was not happened after node start, consensus was not restored 6) Send some NYM from client => No "view change" by timeout or after request 7) Start indy-node service on node2 8) Send some NYM from client => "view change" was made after request, requests were written  *Actual Results:* View change was not happened when the pool comes back to consensus with stopped primary node.  *Expected Results:* View change should happen when the pool comes back to consensus with stopped primary node.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We do a lot of testing before packages (e.g., .deb files) are published in an official repo. This testing tells us a lot–but one thing it cannot tell us is whether the publication itself was handled correctly. We had a recent issue where a release candidate had passed all acceptance tests, but when we copied it from the "rc" repo to the "stable" repo, we forgot to copy a dependency. This mistake broke the Getting Started Guide and the ability for the public to install a stable build–and we didn't notice for a few hours.  We need some automation that does an install of the software on some sort of a schedule (e.g., once per hour). This automation should prove that: * The install of indy-node works on each core platform. * The indy client can be installed on the same machine as indy-node (they don't have conflicting dependencies) * uninstall works  ></description> </Issue>

<Issue id="20805" key="INDY-844" number="844" project="10303" reporter="danielhardman" creator="danielhardman" type="10002" summary="need version check for nodes" description="Whenever a node is activated (powered on, rebooted, etc), it should check with its network to find out what version of the software it should be running. If the node is not running the version that the network expects, we need to recordÂ a message in the logs, and also echo a message to stderr. This will help with a case where a sysadmin tries to join a node to the network without realizing that his/her node isn&apos;t running the correct version of the software." priority="3" status="10200" created="2017-09-13 14:19:25.0" updated="2019-10-11 09:51:27.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="20810"/>

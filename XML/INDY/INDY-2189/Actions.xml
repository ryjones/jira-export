CDATA *PoA* # Update scripts (dockerfiles) to support bionic env # Update pipelines to run tests in new env. Options: ## Run in parallel with xenial testing to verify PRs. *** pros: provides faster feedback before changes actually been merged *** cons: requires double resources and/or increases CI pipeline time. *** Options: #### as standalone pipeline with it own PR status check ***** pros: more verbose GitHub statuses ***** cons: more CI and GitHub configuration routine, copy-paste netween pipelines #### in scope of the same pipeline ***** pros and cons: opposite ## Run nightly: *** pros and cons: opposite  My vision that current infrastructure doesn't have a power to support parallel CI testing. Until it is chaged (either GitLab or Jenkins based solution or other ...) nightly builds is the only possible choice.  ></body> </Action>

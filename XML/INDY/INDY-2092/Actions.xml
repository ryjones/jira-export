CDATA Problem reason:  - load script hasn't utilized get/set auth rule txns necessary to set up custom auth rules constraints with specific metadata  Changes:  - added base (just set the same rules as received from get so they are written to ledger and state) logic of get/set auth rules during init phase of load client  PR:  -Â https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1303  Version:  - Indy Node 1.8.0.dev947  Risk factors:  - no  Risk:  - Low  Covered with tests:  - tested manually  Recommendations for QA  - start load script and ensure that auth rules are written to config ledger (e.g. check logs)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In order to find out proper values for ZMQ queue sizes and a number of messages we process by each run of the looper (DEFAULT_LISTENER_QUOTA, DEFAULT_SENDER_QUOTA, ZMQ_CLIENT_QUEUE_SIZE, ZMQ_NODE_QUEUE_SIZE), we need to measure the following: * How many messages we process in one run in node-to-node and client-to-node stacks ** under the load and not ** average, minimum and maximum values, distribution graph) * How much time each run of the looper takes (from one call to network stack to another) * Size of 3PC batches * Size of messages * How many node-to-node messages we have for 1 3PC Batch and 1 request * How many transport Batches we create and their size (on both KB and number of messages)  For each value we need to measure: * System not under load * System with a steady-state of significant load (see INDY-1343) We need to know the average, minimum and maximum values, distribution graph. This baseline testing should only follow our recommended production configuration.  This baseline testing does not include: * Edge cases * Forced view changes * Combinations of the various configuration values  *Acceptance criteria* * Hooks in the code to perform the measurement * A spreadsheet with info above * A summary document (about 1 page) of findings and recommendations for network node resourcing that can be provided to the Sovrin Foundation * Identified improvements should be raised as separate issues  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="27683" issue="18343" author="lovesh" type="comment" body=" ~krw910  No, INDY-137 will only manifest of you delete the state database. Reason for this behavior is that we construct the entire HashStore (a data store used for storing Merkle Tree nodes) on startup, disregarding the existent HashStore data. We do this for the lack of a good integrity check mechanism. I think we need to create a general integrity check mechanism for all our data stores  " created="2017-06-30 08:16:57.0" updateauthor="lovesh" updated="2017-07-05 12:26:47.0"/>

CDATA To test:  you don't need to delete the state database, just start the node with a big ledger and it should not take too much time, a good check would be to see that starting a node with 1K txns and 60K txns should take about the same time  ></body> </Action>

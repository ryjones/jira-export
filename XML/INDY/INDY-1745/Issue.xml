CDATA *Version Information* indy-node 1.6.78 indy-plenum 1.6.53 indy-anoncreds 1.0.11  *Major Fixes* INDY-1740 - Re-asking for ledger statuses and maximal consistency proofs is not canceled INDY-1741 - Bug in calling notifier methods in Restarter INDY-1696 - 35 view changes were happened during 10 minutes after nodes failure because of invalid request INDY-1700 - Requests queue is not cleared in case of reject-nym transactions. INDY-1672 - Throughput critically decreases without causing view_change INDY-1595 - Node can't catch up large ledger INDY-1621 - Unable to demote node in STN INDY-1653 - View changes happen when all responses should be rejected during load testing scenario INDY-1580 - Node doesn't write txns after disconnection from the rest nodes INDY-1618 - Throughput is degrading if backup primary is stopped  *Changes and Additions* INDY-1681 - Switch off a replica that stopped because disconnected from a backup primary INDY-1667 - Extend load scripts emulating non-smooth load according to the changes in the core script INDY-1607 - Proof of stability under load INDY-1688 - Investigate Out of memory issues with the current load testing INDY-1649 - Do not re-verify signature for Propagates with already verified requests INDY-1704 - POA: Require multiple signatures for important transactions INDY-1665 - Support all FEEs txns in the load script INDY-1661 - Test domain transactions with FEEs INDY-1642 - 3PC Batch should preserve the order of requests when applying PrePrepare on non-primary INDY-1680 - Ability to switch off (remove) replicas with no changes of F value INDY-1589 - A node should be able to participate in BLS multi-signature only if it has a valid proof of posession INDY-1637 - Make validator info as a hystorical data  *Known Issues* INDY-1447 - Upgrade failed on pool from 1.3.62 to 1.4.66 (!) Note that INDY-1447 was fixed in indy-node 1.5.68, but it still presents in indy-node 1.3.62 and 1.4.66 code. So, *some of the nodes may not to be upgraded during simultaneous pool-upgrade*. If this problem will appear, stewards should perform manual upgrade of indy-node in accordance with this instruction:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUvbioL5OsmZMSkwRcu0p0jdttJO5VS8K3GhDLdNaoI  (!) To reduce the risk of reproducing INDY-1447, it is *recommended to use old CLI* for pool upgrade from indy-node *1.3.62*.  (!) *Pool upgrade from indy-node 1.3.62 to indy-node 1.6.78 should be performed simultaneously for all nodes due to txn format changes.* (!) *All indy-cli pools should be recreated with actual genesis files.* (i) *For more details about txn format changes see INDY-1421.*   (!) *There are possible OOM issues during 3+ hours of target load or large catch-ups at 8 GB RAM nodes pool so 32 GB is recommended.*  ></description> </Issue>

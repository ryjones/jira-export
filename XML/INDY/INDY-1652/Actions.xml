This task might become an epic since it might impact not only version scheme and git tags routine but the whole development and release workflows. I am going to accumulate my thoughts about versioning and releasing and post a kind of a design here in a few days." created="2018-08-30 16:35:05.0" updateauthor="andkononykhin" updated="2018-08-30 16:35:05.0"/>

CDATA Andrey: I appreciate your effort here, but I cannot consume a 21-page document with a table of contents and so forth. It's simply too overwhelming. Here's what would help me to make useful decisions: # What are the key differences between what we did before and what you want to do now? # Why?  I don't want to close this ticket until our entire organization is aligned.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~danielhardman  I agree: a kind of summary is missed there, I will add that to the document at the top.  >What are the key differences between what we did before and what you want to do now?  There are a lot differences between projects, I will mostly keep in mind two documents (slides and docs) that describe "approved" approach plus current indy node way which I am aware of most of all.Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Story* As an administrator of a node for an Indy network, I want to clearly understand the scope of changes in each release and map that release to version numbers in JIRA and the release notes.  *Goals:* * Version numbers use 4 values, generally following semver: major release, minor release, service pack, and build. * The build number increases with each build, starting with zero on each service pack. * The major, minor, and service pack numbers should be the same for all artifacts in the release: debian, android, etc. The build number can float. * Next release needs to be one higher than the current stable build.  *Acceptance criteria:* * Design/PoA  * WBS and technical tasks * Review of Design  ></description> </Issue>

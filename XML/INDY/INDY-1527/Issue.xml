CDATA *Story* As a trustee responsible for an Indy Node network, I want to be able to update ledger permissions so that I can implement my governance rules specific to my network.  *Acceptance Criteria* The ledger permissions available to each role should be configurable without code changes.  *Notes* * The list of ledger roles and the list of permissions do not need to be configurable, but the mapping between them should be configurable. * The current ledger roles and permissions should remain the same.  ></description> </Issue>

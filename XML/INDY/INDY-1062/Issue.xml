CDATA  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/getting-started.md   Case 1: broken link  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/stable/vagrant/sandbox/DevelopmentEnvironment/Vagrantfile  here: Note: If you're looking to create an actual Developer Environment connected to a sandbox, please visit this _{color:#d04437}guide{color}_ instead.   Case 2: Wrong output of command _load sample/faber-request.indy_ in example: ALICE> load sample/faber-request.indy {color:#d04437}New wallet Default created{color} {color:#d04437}Active wallet set to "Default"{color} 1 connection request found for Faber College. Creating Connection for Faber College.   Try Next:     show connection "Faber College"     accept request from "Faber College"   New wallet Default will not be created because wallet Alice was created manually on one of previous steps.    Case 3: Links to vagrant instruction ( https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/stable/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md ) are still broken for both of stable and master versions. These links should accord to master/stable instruction version.  ></description> </Issue>

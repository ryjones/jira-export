CDATA Comment from  ~ashcherbakov   Problem reason: a new transaction field is added, so that serialized data contains less fields than it's now. An exception was thrown during de-serialization (it was expected that the number of serialized fields for a transaction is always equal to the current number of fields) Changes: it turned out there were no tests for CompactSerizliser (the serializer we currently use for ledger) - covered with tests if we have more fields than in the current transaction - use a None value make merkle tree of old transactions the same for the case when we added new fields Committed into: sovrin-node 0.3.111 sovrin-client 0.3.104 Risk factors: update adding new fields Risk: Medium Covered with tests: https://github.com/evernym/ledger/blob/master/ledger/test/test_compact_serializer.py - 21 new tests https://github.com/evernym/ledger/blob/master/ledger/test/test_ledger.py: testRecoverLedgerNewFieldsToTxnsAdded  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I am unable to upgrade Stable build (node) 0.3.7 to Stable build (node) 0.3.13  When trying to upgrade from build 0.3.7 to 0.3.13 I get the following error.  Another issue is that there was a change to the scheme where a new field in the transactions was added for signature. Even getting past the error below the upgrade should still fail.  {code} Unpacking sovrin-node (0.3.13) over (0.3.7) ... dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/sovrin-node_0.3.13_amd64.deb (--unpack): trying to overwrite '/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/data/transactions_live', which is also in package python3-sovrin-common 0.2.5 dpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe) ~/.sovrin / / mv: cannot stat '/usr/local/bin/upgrade_sovrin_node_ubuntu1604.sh': No such file or directory mv: cannot stat '/usr/local/bin/upgrade_sovrin_node_ubuntu1604_test.sh': No such file or directory Preparing to unpack .../python3-sovrin-common_0.2.8_amd64.deb ...

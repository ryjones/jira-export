CDATA *Story* As a user of an Indy network that enforces a transaction author agreement, I do not want my agreement acceptance time to be recorded with my transactions as it is specific enough that it could allow correlation across my various DIDs and payment addresses.  *Acceptance Criteria* * When an agreement is anchored to the ledger, only the date needs to be recorded. * When a transaction is written to the ledger, only the date of the agreement acceptance should be recorded on the ledger as part of the transaction. * If the signed transaction includes too much precision in the timestamp, the transaction should be rejected with the error: "TAA timestamp is too precise and is a privacy risk." * Validation of agreement acceptance should accept any transaction with the same acceptance date as the current agreement was posted to the ledger, or newer. * If the timestamp when the author agreement was anchored to the ledger is within two minutes of zero UTC, then future transactions with a user agreement acceptance date of the previous day will also be accepted to account for potential clock skew.  *Note* * The format of the transaction on the ledger does not need to change from a datetime, we will just ignore the timestamp portion of the datatype.  ></description> </Issue>

<Action id="43489" issue="29704" author="mgbailey" type="comment" body="I like INDY-1278.  I do have concern that the notifications may become too common, though.  If a steward is receiving several notifications a day that require no action on his part, he will probably start filtering and ignoring notifications. Where I am going with this, is that I think that a log message like this continues to be useful, as well as notifications." created="2018-04-26 14:22:34.0" updateauthor="mgbailey" updated="2018-04-26 14:22:34.0"/>

CDATA State machine thinking (not necessarily a formal state machine pattern) could probably help us implement with greater confidence in various contexts. We don't have the freedom to do a comprehensive overhaul as one big effort, but if we could identify granular subtasks and incremental improvements, we could begin them quickly.  This task is to analyze how state machine thinking could help us in at least the following 3 areas: consensus, view change, and catchup. Each of those could be different state machines.  What we'd like to do in this task is study/think about the state machines that would be appropriate to these problems, and draw a picture (UML state machine) or create some other sort of diagram that describes how we want them to work. We can then generate new tickets/subtasks to implement some or all of the work implied by those artifacts.  ></description> </Issue>

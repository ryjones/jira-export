CDATA The plan is to divide the documentation into several files each containing a separate topic and referenced from the index file, something that we can later host at readthedocs or something. The topics would be (intentionally skipped the CLI): *Indy-plenum:* 	1. Communication layer covering curvezmq's use and the Stack (and it's children) abstraction 	2. Storage layer covering ledger, state, merkle tre/ie their supplemantary storage, client's storage and serialisations in ledger and state 	3. Node and its usage (init/destroy) of stacks and other storage 	4. Catchup process 	6. View change process 	7. Monitoring 	8. Kinds of messages and fields and their validation 	9. Request handling covering authentication (cover ClientAuthNr), validation and post ordering (cover RequestHandler class), intentionally skipping RBFT specific parts as the reader can be pointed to the paper, however the changes we have in the 3 phase messages compared to RBFT do need to be called out. 	10. Wallet and signing 	11. Client and request-reply cycle, retries, reply observers 	12. Addition and removal of nodes covered by PoolManager and clients learning about membership changes 	13. BLS, its use during consensus 	14. Config params *Indy-node:* 	1. ATTRIB txn and its store 	2. NYM txn and IdrCache 	3. SCHEMA and CLAIM_DEF txn 	4. Upgrade process and config txns  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The plan looks good in general. Some comments: 1) I don't see any big value to include client-related docs, since it will be deprecated quite soon (items 10, 11) 2) I think the main Index file should start with a general description of the project from technical point of view listing the main technologies we use (like 'This is a distributed ledger supporting Byzantine Failures where RBFT is used for consensus with ed25519 and BLS signatures support........' 3) I think we need a section about Auth rules and roles.  Also please note that RAET, Plenum CLI and Client code will be deprecated and removed soon.  ></body> </Action>

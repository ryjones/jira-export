CDATA Everywhere where "Acme Corp" or "acmecorp.com" exists in the documentation, change it to "Plexane, Inc." and "plexaneinc.com". Acme Corp, although is a fictional company in the Looney Tunes cartoon series, today it is a real company with a real website. Verified as of the creation of this ticket that "Plexane, Inc" is not pulling up in search engines at this time.  Interim fix: Where found, a phrase something similar to "the fictional company..." will be added for clarification.  ></description> </Issue>

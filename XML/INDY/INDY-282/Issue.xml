CDATA Upgrade: Upgrade with demoted nodes. Can you send the transaction without listing the demoted nodes?  *Things tried:*  Case 1: Demote any node, send POOL_UPGRADE for whole pool. Case 2: Demote any node, send POOL_UPGRADE only for not demoted nodes (do not specify demoted nodes, useÂ force=True parameter).  *Findings:*  Case 1: Demoted nodes are scheduled to upgrade after promotion. Case 2: Only specified nodes are scheduled to upgrade.  *Summary:*  Upgrade without listing the demoted nodes works as expected. No problems were found.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA What is the process to manually catch up a node? If we have a ledger of 1 million transactions or more it could take days for it to catch up. If new transactions are continuing to be written to the ledger the new node may never catch up.  We need a process in which a new node can be added and manually caught up. The process would allow the ledger to be copied to the new node and when it starts the first time it will be caught up to the pool or close enough it won't take long to get in sync.  The process will also allow for a disaster scenario so a single good ledger could be use to rebuild a pool.  ></description> </Issue>

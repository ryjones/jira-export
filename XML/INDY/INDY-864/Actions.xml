CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.3.362 AWS 25-nodes pool  *Things being tried:* 1.1. Adding node with only part of ledger (35,000 transactions on added node, 100,000 on the rest nodes). 1.2. Make sure that added node works fine by running load test.  2.1. Adding node wit full copy of active node ledger (100,000 transactions). 2.2. Make sure that added node works fine by running load test.   *Findings:* "Manual catch-up" works fine, all nodes were successfully added. There were only one issue - one node which was added with part of ledger, had some problems after adding. After load test it was not able to write about 10 transactions. Example: 100,000 transactions on all nodes after adding => writing 1000 transactions with load test => 101,000 txns on all nodes, 100,990 on added node => 1000 transactions more => 102,000 transactions on all nodes, 101,990 on the added node. Totally 5 nodes were added, but this behavior was noticed only on one of them. So, most probably this behavior resulted by current stability issues, not by "manual catch-up".  *General notes:* "Manual catch-up" for 100,000 txns ledger happens instantly, when usual catch-up takes about 16 minutes for this size.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * Tests should be implemented which show that if some request doesn't get ordered for long enough for some reason then view change starts and successfully completes (probably can be shared with INDY-1911) * Tests should be implemented which show that if more than _f_ and less than _n-f_ nodes entered view change then remaining honest will also enter and successfully complete a view change, regardless of presence or absence of incoming requests * Implement broadcasting of INSTANCE_CHANGE message when state doesn't get updated long enough * Threshold timeout should be configurable, and it should be possible to turn off this functionality  *Additional notes* * This will make sure that if more than _f_ and less than _n-f_ nodes enter view change then if (and as soon as) there are any incoming write requests then remaining nodes that are not yet in view change will also enter view change allowing it to finish * In other words it should reliably fix problem occured in INDY-1903 * Unlike INDY-1910 this doesn't increase risk of perpetual view change under high load * There should be functionality to periodically update state even if there are no incoming requests * In other words this is blocked by INDY-933   ></description> </Issue>

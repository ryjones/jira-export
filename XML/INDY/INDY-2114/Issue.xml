CDATA _Environment_: BuilderNet node FoundationBuilder was updated with the rest of the BuilderNet to indy-node version 1.7.1 on May 6. When we added a new node to the ledger today we noticed spamming  _Steps to Reproduce_: unknown trigger, but seems like the last update (1.7.1) might have something to do with this.  The BuilderNet was updated on May 6 and here is the time stamp in the logs of the first instance of the error: 2019-05-09 07:37:19,863 . (found in FoundationBuilder.log.1.xz)  _Expected Behavior_: No log spamming by seeder_service  _Observed Behavior_: Logs are full of invalid CATCHUP_REQ's.  Please see attached zip files. Right now I am getting 6 of the following, exactly the same, every second(they weren't always exactly like this one):  2019-05-29 14:45:23,800|INFO|seeder_service.py|FoundationBuilder received catchup request: CATCHUP_REQ{'ledgerId': 0, 'catchupTill': 27, 'seqNoStart': 13, 'seqNoEnd': 27} from b'm$A>b-io?3s#ui@iPqPU+pD)1DJD)JNg#$oZ%^ -'  _Notes_: Attachment Foundation1 shows earliest instance of issue.  Foundation shows latest from today.  Attaching all logs in one big zip exceeding max size, but I can attach other logs if needed.        ></description> </Issue>

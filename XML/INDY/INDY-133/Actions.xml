CDATA The reason is that there is no handling for in zstack PublicKeyNotFoundOnDisk and error message is not whitelisted.

CDATA Pull request for stp was reverted, because it was decided to leave handling of PublicKeyNotFoundOnDisk as is since it very specific case.  To close this ticket it is needed to fix a bug in creation of public key file when SERVICES field of NODE request is empty (file is not created): https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/plenum/server/pool_manager.py#L228  ></body> </Action>

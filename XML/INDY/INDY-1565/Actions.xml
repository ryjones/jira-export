CDATA *Problem state / reason:*  Due to EMA features spikes in requests processing by replicas in case of low load (when empty windows occur) may cause false positive master degradation. For more details please see ticket description.  *Changes:*  Added a new strategy that deals with empty windows (windows without processed requests) using state machine. State machine allows to smooth out** spikes in requests processing by averaging the number of processed requests using empty windows.  *Committed into:*  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/872 https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/916 indy-node 1.6.580-master  *Risk factors:*  False positive master degradation in case of spikes of requests processing by master replica and non-master replicas in different windows due to EMA features.  *Risk:*  Medium  *Recommendations for QA:*  Use various load testing and see that no false positive master degradation occurred.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.582 / 1.6.585  Steps to Validate: 1. Run load tests with continious/spike/DDOS load. 2. Check validator-info and logs for VCs and their reasons.  Actual Results: There are no false-positive VCs occured during load testing.  ></body> </Action>

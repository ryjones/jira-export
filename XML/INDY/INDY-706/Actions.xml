CDATA If we install ubuntu server on VM and try to copy paste and execute the commands:   1. Copy Paste from local machine to ubuntu server on VM is not working in MAC. If we enable drag and drop option to bidirectional then copy paste will work on linux machines but it's not working on MAC. 2. So I have installed ubuntu desktop on VM and executing the commands.  -When I tried to copy paste the commands, some white spaces and new lines are getting created. It is causing the command to fail each time.  ></body> </Action>

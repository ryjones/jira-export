CDATA After upgrading to indy-node 1.1.33, running the "reset_client" command results in a completely empty .sovrin directory.  All files, including the genesis files, are deleted.  This appears to be due to renaming of the standard files in this directory.  The file names need to be updated in the "keepFilesInClientReset" struct in the script_helper.py file.  *Acceptance Criteria* * The script should either be fixed or removed.  ></description> </Issue>

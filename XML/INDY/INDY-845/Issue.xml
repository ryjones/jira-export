CDATA Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool. 2. Duplicate any key in domain_transactions_sandbox_genesis at any node. 3. Start all nodes.  Actual Results: Node with malformed this way genesis file cannot catch up with other nodes due to incorrect transaction tree root and marks all other nodes as suspicious so it doesn't participate in consensus (see log for more info).  Desired behavior:  Node should emit an error about duplicate transaction making genesis file invalid, then exit.  ></description> </Issue>

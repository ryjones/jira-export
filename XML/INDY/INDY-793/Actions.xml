CDATA  ~ozheregelya  Is this a new issue or has it just not been seen before? Do the consensus experts believe this is incorrect behavior? Is it consistently reproducible? Is it the test or the code being tested?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~krw910 , I believe that this is not new issue. It was noticed first time in INDY-292: {quote}On 103th transaction Node1C and Node2C appeared in both ackNodes and nackNodes columns of pref_results spreadsheet:Â  ^perf_results_1_1000_1497994390.csv  The rest transactions were failed. After completion of the test cluster does not send NYMs. {quote} Then, I thought that this behavior results breaking of the pool. But now I see that I was mistaken. All transactions are written to the ledger independently on appearing of these rows in output file, so I think it is not a critical problem (probably it is problem in load_test.py output, or not a problem at all). I discussed it with our developers and we decided that it will be better to create a ticket and explore this behavior to make sure is this a problem or not. This behavior reproduces almost always during sending valid transactions using load_test.py with --at-once.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We had created a script that was able to create custom genesis transaction files that used custom alias names and node ports. The default " generate_sovrin_pool_transactions " script is hard coded to use NodeX and Port XXXX where they just increment the number.  Â   With all the changes we have made with serialized ledgers and BLS keys we need a new tool that can create the genesis files that are not using the default test settings.  ></description> </Issue>

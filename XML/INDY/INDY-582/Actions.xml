CDATA  ~SeanBohan_Sovrin ,  ~ashcherbakov   Hi all,  does it mean that our CLIs should support command to flush verkey from ledger? For now empty verkey is not allowed by both python-based and IndySDK-based CLIs, and NYM transaction without verkey for existing DID does not flush its' verkey.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Problem state / reason:*  Setting verkey to nothing has not been supported by both server and client side. Flushing verkey logic is needed by user to have ability to go back under guardianship.  *Changes:*   - Server-side/client-side: now empty verkey (None) is allowed by request/operation validation;  - Added several tests;  - Docs are updated.  *Committed into:*      https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/521     https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/555     indy-node 1.2.298-master  *Risk factors:*      Some non-expected logical errors related to permissions.  *Risk:*      Medium  *Recommendations for QA:*  The main test-case:   - Take the python-based client  - Become a someone who can create NYMs  - Create new DID and send NYM with verkey  - Become newly created DID  - Send NYM for himself with empty verkey (go back under guardianship, operation should succeed)  - Send NYM for himself with some verkey, operation should fail due to absent verkey in ledger  - Become origin creator of NYM  - Update verkey by sending NYM transaction, operation should succeed  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.298  Steps to Validate: 1. Take the python-based client. 2. Become a someone who can create NYMs. 3. Create new DID and send NYM with verkey. 4. Become newly created DID. 5. Send NYM for himself with empty verkey (go back under guardianship). 6. Send NYM for himself with some verkey. 7. Become *origin creator* of NYM. 8. Update verkey by sending NYM transaction.  Actual Results: DID can rotate its verkey to nothing and becomes unable to control it. *Origin creator* can set verkey to this DID if it has empty verkey only.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.734  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool. 2. Run following load from 2 clients: {code:java} perf_processes.py -g persistent_transactions_genesis -m t -n 1 -y one -s 000000000000000000000000Truste e1 -k nym -c 10 -b 1 -l 15 {code}    3. Run stepwise load: {code:java} spike:                                     req_kind: nym mode: stepwise                           step_value: 1                            step_time_in_seconds: 1800               step_initial_load_rate: 1 {code} *Actual Results:* Pool stopped working after ~10 hours of load (most of the time only 30 nyms/sec were send). No ViewChanges were happened. According to validator-info, only two nodes (Node1 and Node7) have not deleted replicas.  *Logs and metrics:* s3://qanodelogs/indy-1921 To get logs, run following command on log processor machine:  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://qanodelogs/indy-1921/ /home/ev/logs/indy-1921/  ></description> </Issue>

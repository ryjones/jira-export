CDATA It is very useful to be able to search for something, such as a particular DID or verkey, in a ledger.  For a small ledger (100 or less transactions) this can easily be done by piping the output of read_ledger to grep: {code:java} read_ledger --type domain | grep MEPecrczs4Wh6FA12u519D{code} For a larger ledger, the admin would first need to use --count to determine the size of the ledger, and then do a second call using the result to retrieve the entire range using --frm and --to before piping to grep.  Please provide the ability to search for something on the whole ledger.  This may be as easy as a --all flag to retrieve the entire contents of the ledger that can be used with a pipe to grep.  It is possible that --all may be inefficient with very large ledgers, so an alternative method may be to provide a --find flag with a parameter of the value sought, which would search the entire ledger. Properly written, this latter may be more efficient.  The proposed --find should return all entries that contain the value.  ></description> </Issue>

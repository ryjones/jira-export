CDATA  ~avkrishnan ,  This is correct behavior. When you send first transaction send NYM dest=4QxzWk3ajdnEA37NdNU5Kt verkey= empty verkey will written to the ledger. But your verkey in the wallet (on your machine) was not changed.  After that, each transaction send by this identifier will be signed with signing key (which accords your old verkey) from your wallet. But transaction will be validated using your new verkey stored in ledger (empty value in your case).  So, the message "Error: client request invalid: InvalidSignature()" just mean that verkey stored in the ledger does not accord to signing key which you are using for signing of transaction. In your case it is expected behavior.  Please, pay attention that now 'verkey=' is invalid in CLI:    {code:java} sovrin@test> send NYM dest=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f verkey= Invalid syntax: 'send NYM dest=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f verkey=' send NYM -------- title: Adds given DID to sovrin usage: send NYM dest=<target DID> role=<role>  verkey=<ver-key>  example(s): send NYM dest=BiCMHDqC5EjheFHumZX9nuAoVEp8xyuBgiRi5JcY5whi role=TRUST_ANCHOR send NYM dest=33A18XMqWqTzDpLHXLR5nT verkey=~Fem61Q5SnYhGVVHByQNxHj {code} It was done few months ago because 'verkey=' resulted breaking of the pool.

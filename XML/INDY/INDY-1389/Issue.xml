CDATA Details are contained here:   https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wcYSn9XXX6-0M5le1icT6N-funiB7K9cActzYfILto/edit   *Acceptance Criteria:* - Use the improved indy-crypto library from IS-750 - Make sure that we can extend NODE txn in a non-breaking way - Extend NODE txn with a (optional) field to specify Proof of possession for BLS key - Validate the Proof of possession for BLS once a NODE txn is received - Blacklist the Node if verification failed - Make sure that we verify the proof after the node is started   For future: Make the proof required, not optional, so every node should have the proof if it has a BLS key.

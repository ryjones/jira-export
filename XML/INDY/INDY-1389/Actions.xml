CDATA Problem reason: - The previous BLS scheme has a bug called the rogue public key attack where an attacker can forge aggregate signatures by non-participating members.In view change a lot of client requests lead to out_of_memory problem and clients receive responces timeout error.  Changes: - Added bls public key proof of possession in transactions with adding and changing bls key. - Added validation of bls key via proof of possession - Increment indy crypto to the stable version 0.4.3  PR: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/902  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/880  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/899  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/867   Version: * indy-node 1.6.570 -master * indy-plenum 1.6.513 -master  Risk factors: - Problem with adding new nodes and changing a node data.  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: -  test_pool_req_handler_static_validation.py|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/867/files#diff-f4b9684b90a1ca7bfbcc06535abee8ee  -  test_nodes_data_changed.py|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/867/files#diff-2847b93c9ba9f724b810a04903d6a491   Recommendations for QA: * Try to add new nodes, change bls key, change other data. * May be update all nodes besides one and change bls keys on it. Pull shouldn't process it transaction and should send NACK. * Send a Node transaction without proof or only proof without bls key. * Try to reproduce the rogue public key attack.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.575 indy-cli 1.6.2~714  *Steps to Validate:* ~~~Valid cases~~~ 1. Add node with valid pair blsley+blskey_pop. (/) 2. Update node data (IPs, ports, services). (/) 3. Demote and promote node back. (/) 4. Rotate node blskey. (/) 5. Check old CLI. (/) ~~~Invalid cases~~~ 1. Try to add node with valid blskey and invalid blskey_pop. => REQNACK from node received, error message in indy-cli: Transaction has been rejected: Proof of possession <blskey_pop> is incorrec for BLS key <blskey> 2. Try to add node with valid blskey and without blskey_pop. => REQNACK from node received, error message in indy-cli: Transaction has been rejected: A Proof of possession must be provided with BLS key 3. Try to add node with valid blskey_pop and without blskey. => REQNACK from node received, error message in indy-cli: Transaction has been rejected: A Proof of possession is not needed without BLS key 4. Try to send blskey_pop in invalid format.  => Format validation works.  *Actual Results:* Proof of Possession was added for BLS keys and works as expected. Existing functionality works as well, no regression was found.   ></body> </Action>

STEPS TO REPRODUCE # Stop sovrin-node.service on Node2. # Send transactions. # Check that all nodes except Node2 has similar amount of transactions. # Perform *restart* command for sovrin-node.service on the Node2.  h6. ACTUAL RESULT:  Node2 cannot perform catch up. h6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - Steps in this ticket are similar to INDY-159 but in the current situation problem is only on Node2. Other nodes and NYM sending are working. - I leaved pool in which that problem was found in current state.

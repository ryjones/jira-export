CDATA In order to make the _auth_map_ structure configurable we need to move it to the config ledger. Here we should: - define a data format for storing in the config ledger - define a new transactions for adding/modifying of authorization rules - create required set of genesis transactions to be able to bootstrap - modify applying of the rules stored in the config ledger according to new format  There is the question of atomicity of adding and modification of the rules for all administrative actions. Possible solutions: - each rule can be added/modified by separate transaction; - all rules are added/modified by single transaction, i.e. this transaction contains a list of all rules for administrative actions for atomic update.  I think, the first point is better.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA AWS acceptance pool (4+2 nodes) indy-node 1.5.67 (RC) libindy/indy-cli 1.5.0~2 (RC)  ></environment> <description><! CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 4 nodes and 2 additional nodes. 2. Add Node5 and Node6. 3. Demote Node6 twice (see pool ledger in the folder with logs) and promote it back. !   Result of this demotion was not checked because second demotion and promotion was happened by mistake in the batch. 4. Demote Node6 again.  5. Send several txns. => Txns were not written on Node6. 6. Demote Node6 again, send txn. => Txns were not written on Node6 in few seconds after demotion. 7. Try to demote Node6 as steward on Node5. => Error message appeared in the CLI, but after this all missed txns were written in Node6.  *Actual Results:* Node was promoted after two demotions.  *Expected Results:* Node should not be promoted after demotion.

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.633  Steps to Validate: 1. Setup the pool of 4 nodes and 2 additional nodes. 2. Add Node5 and Node6. 3. Demote Node6 twice (see pool ledger in the folder with logs) and promote it back. 4. Demote Node6 again.  5. Send several txns. 6. Demote Node6 again, send txn. 7. Send several txns.

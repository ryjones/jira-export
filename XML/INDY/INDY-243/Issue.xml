CDATA Fix the ledger so a corrupt database record doesn't prevent the service from starting.  Success criteria for the ticket: either the service runs with a corrupted record (simply failing to retrieve that record with a graceful error) â€“ or, if the database is too damaged to use, the service exits with a graceful error and says something like this to the log and the screen: "The database is corrupt. To fix the problem, delete the database and rebuild."  ></description> </Issue>

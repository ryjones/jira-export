CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.565  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install 25 nodes pool. 2. Disable VC `unsafe=set( 'disable_view_change' )`. 3. Run 40 clients that send 1 NYM/sec to fill ledger with 4k txns. 4. Stop indy-node service on backup 1 primary (Node2). 5. Run 100 clients that send 1 NYM/sec load test.  Actual Results: There are 4 nodes that don't write and don't catchup txns: 4, 12, 14, 15 (4239 txns in ledger). Stopped Node2 has 4222 txns in ledger so it looks like bad nodes go forward the rest nodes at Step 3 (so the issue can be similar to INDY-1539 where we have >=f nodes that go forward).  Expected Results: All nodes except stopped Node2 should have the same amount txns in ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

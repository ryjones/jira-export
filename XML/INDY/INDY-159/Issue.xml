CDATA Build Info: sovrin-node 0.3.19 sovrin-client 0.3.20  Overview: "send NYM" command doesn't work with stopped node in pool (1 of 4) and after restart stopped node it doesn't work too.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Execute "systemctl stop sovrin-node" on one of nodes in the pool. 2. Create new key and execute some "send NYM" commands. 3. Execute "systemctl start sovrin-node" on stopped node. 4. Create new key and execute some "send NYM" commands.  Actual Results: "send NYM" command doesn't work after stopping node. "send NYM" command doesn't work after restarting node.  Expected Results: "send NYM" command should work in both cases.  Additional Information: First few "send NYM" commands (1 or 2) work successfully after stopping a node, but all next do not.  Nodes' logs are backuped as NodeX_06.06.2017.log files.

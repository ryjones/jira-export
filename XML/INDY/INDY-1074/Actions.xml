CDATA *Problem state / reason:*  ATTRIB and GET_ATTR for hash and enc attributes were not implemented on client and server sides.  *Changes:*  Client side/CLI:  - Added command regexps for ATTRIB/GET_ATTR operations for hash and enc attributes.  - Added support of hash and enc attributes to the code that builds requests and parses replies.  Server side:  - Added validation schemas for ATTRIB/GET_ATTR operations for hash and enc attributes.  - Support hash and enc attributes for storing and looking up.  Also implemented several related tests for client and server sides.  *Committed into:*        https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/515       https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/548      indy-node 1.2.294-master  *Risk factors:*      Nothing is expected.  *Risk:*      Low  *Recommendations for QA:*  Send ATTRIB/GET_ATTR operations (correct and incorrect) for RAW, HASH and ENC attributes using old and new CLIs. Note that GET_ATTR for HASH and ENC is something like "proof of existence".  NOTE: HASH attribute should be SHA256 hash value.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.295  Steps to Validate: 1. Install pool. 2. Send NYM to ledger. 3. Add all types of attributes (RAW, HASH, ENC) to this NYM via `send ATTRIB`. 4. Get this attributes via `send GET_ATTRIB`.  Actual Results: Node can add and return new attributes (it's checked via old CLI, new CLI doesn't support this types of attributes now so IS-560 is reported).  ></body> </Action>

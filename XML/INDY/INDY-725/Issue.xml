CDATA When the client cli is run, it generates a world-readable cli.log file that echoes all commands typed into the cli.  Unfortunately, this includes seeds, which are sensitive information.  For example, if a trustee types in his seed in the CLI to perform his duties, what he types in is written to the cli.log as follows:  2017-08-04 14:02:45,481 | INFO     | cli.py               (1921) | parse | CLI command entered: new key with seed secretTrusteeSeed000000000000000   This seed data should not be written to the log.  A better solution would be to mask the seed when writing to the log:  2017-08-04 14:02:45,481 | INFO     | cli.py               (1921) | parse | CLI command entered: new key with seed  redacted    The same information is written to .sovrin-cli-history, which is also a world-readable file.  Seeds should also be redacted there.  ></description> </Issue>

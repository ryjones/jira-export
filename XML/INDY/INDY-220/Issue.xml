CDATA Currently we require only F + 1 replies from the nodes to assume that our request was processed successfully. Since we require only 2F + 1 nodes to reach consensus to commit a transaction it opens us up for "dirty reads".  Example: * We have a pool of 5 nodes * We send a transaction to the pool * 3 nodes reach consensus and commit the transaction (F = 1, 2F +1 = 3) * A different client tries to read data updated by this particular transaction * It receives old data from 2 nodes which haven't committed the transaction yet (F + 1 = 2)  ></description> </Issue>

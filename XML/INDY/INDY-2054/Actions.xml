CDATA Stable versions are compatible since they both have X.Y.Z version form.  The issue is actual for cases when we try to upgrade from versions that used old verioning to non-stable onces with new versioning (e.g. to dev or rc builds).  Here we mostly worry about rc to allow QA validation of coming release 1.7.0 and we may consider the following workaround: * during release pipeline we would have *1.7.0~rcN* candidate published to debian repo to *rc* component * the CD pipeline is paused here and waits QA approval * we may manually repack and publish *1.7.0~rcN* -> *1.6.M* where M is enough to "win" current max rc candidate (currently is 1.6.83, thus M>=84). "Repack" means that it would include the same content but different debian package metadata in version field. * QA will use that version for validation process  ></body> </Action>

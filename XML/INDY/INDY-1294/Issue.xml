CDATA *Story* As a consumer of Indy, I want to the documentation to be easy to find and easy to use so that I can quickly get my questions answered and deploy a node.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Documentation exists within the /docs/ folder of the Indy source code repository. * Documentation should be divided based on the target audience: contributors to Indy vs consumers of Indy. * Documentation meant for consumers of Indy should be published to ReadTheDocs.io.  *Notes* * Advantages to using ReadTheDocs.io: ** It is consistent with other Hyperledger projects. ** It is easier to find via Google than documentation only contained in GitHub. * Documentation in ReadTheDocs must be in RST format. Converters exist from MarkDown to RST. * See the Docs guidance provided by the Fabric project:  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.1/docs   ></description> </Issue>

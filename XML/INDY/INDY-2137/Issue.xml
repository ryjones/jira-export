CDATA * Checkpointer Service needs to deal with all Checkpoints-related logic (creation, processing and stabilization of checkpoints as well as updating of watermarks) * Checkpointer Service code needs to be taken from Replica into a separate class * ConsensusSharedData needs to be used for a common data needed for multiple services (such as Ordering, Checkpointer, View Change) ** In particular, watermarks need to be there * No references to Replica or Node classes can be there * All network communication must be done via ExternalBus ** It needs to subscribe to Checkpoint messages and process them * Stashing must be implemented via StashingRouter * All internal (between services) communication must be done via InternalBus * Tests must be adopted   Docs * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/design/plenum_2_0_architecture_class.png * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/design/plenum_2_0_architecture_object.png * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/design/plenum_2_0_communication.png  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Background*  We currently test with a pool of 25 nodes, but we are on track to recruit more than that number of stewards. Additional nodes provides more confidence that the network cannot be undermined. We need to discover how the pool will behave with a larger number of stewards so that we can appropriately schedule the on-boarding of additional stewards.  We recognize that there are problems with view change that will not be resolved until late 2018 (See INDY-1376), so we need to know how the current implementation behaves.  *Acceptance Criteria*  Test consensus with the specified numbers of nodes. There may be three tests: 50 nodes, 40 nodes, and 30 nodes.Â If the test fails, test again with fewer nodes. If network performance is acceptable, then end the test and report back that we are ready for further testing at that level. * Set up the pool and load it with traffic for 30 minutes * Evaluate the quality of the network ** Is there a consistent view of the master? ** Is performance reasonable? ** Are there lots of failed transactions? * Trigger a view change, continue load for 10 minutes, and re-evaluate the quality of the network.  Report on the performance of the network at each tested level.  ></description> </Issue>

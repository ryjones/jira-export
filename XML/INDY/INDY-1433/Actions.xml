CDATA  ~ashcherbakov  pointed out that the number of messages increases exponentially with the number of nodes: Increasing the number of validator nodes will increase the average number of node-to-node messages to process 1 3PC batch (of 100 requests) for each node from 3000 (25 nodes) to 6000 (31 nodes).  I spoke with  ~nage ,  ~danielhardman , and  ~tharmon , who each said it is a common expectation that the validator node pool of the Sovrin network will be capped at 25 nodes for the time being.  ></body> </Action>

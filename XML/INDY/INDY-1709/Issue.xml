CDATA If primary will include digest of already ordered request, then this pre-prepare will not be considered as faulty one and "repeated" request will be ordered by every node again.  This is bad because: * Faulty primary node can save some txn and when state changed, this node can revert state to saved txn * Primary can degrade performance by not ordering new client requests and only re-ordering old already ordered txns  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently indy-node during POOL_UPGRADE txn dynamic validation doesn't check whether system package with specified package name and target version is available or not: * upgrade is scheduled regardless of that * that check is delayed until NodeControlTool starts real upgrade  It makes sense to add such check to dynamic validation to reject incorrect POOL_UPGRADE txns earlier.  Options: # send request to NodeControlTool to make such validation during dynamic validation phase  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Good questions.   ~esplinr  may correct me, but I think the answers are the following: * TAA's text can be empty. * I believe that there needs to be a way to disable TAA. Empty text is equal to absence of TAA. * I think that the hash can be serialized the same way, as in Request, that is the digest value as a string of hexadecimal digits (`sha256().hexdigest()`)  ></body> </Action>

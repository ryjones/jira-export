CDATA Stewards are reporting that libindy-crypto is not "held" in apt, meaning that it will likely be inadvertently upgraded in the course of routine maintenance. I will try to mitigate this by emailing instructions to existing stewards to correct the lapse.  To help future stewards, please have the package installer add this to the list of packages that are held in apt.  ></description> </Issue>

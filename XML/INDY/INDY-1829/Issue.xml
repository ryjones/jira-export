CDATA As of now, GET_TXN doesn't support State (Audit) Proofs, and requires to be sent to all nodes and waiting for f+1 equal replies.  GET_TXN may be used a lot in some cases, so we need to evaluate max performance the pool can handle with GET_TXN.  *Acceptance criteria* * Run load tests sending GET_TXN, find out max performance and evaluate stability ** Start with sending 10 GET_TX per sec ** Increment the load sequentially  ></description> </Issue>

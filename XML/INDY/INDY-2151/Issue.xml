CDATA Current number of available system tests in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation repo and their running time is not acceptable for Indy Node master CD pipeline. which is triggered for each commit to master branch.  But we want to be sure that all these tests are passed. Thus it makes sense to run them periodically (nightly). Unit and integration tests might be run as well.  Acceptance criteria: * build is auto triggered once a day (nightly) on the HEAD of the master branch * (optional) build can be triggered manually at any time * all unit/integration/system tests should be run  ></description> </Issue>

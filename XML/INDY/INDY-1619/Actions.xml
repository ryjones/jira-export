CDATA After long View Change, nodes 10,11,12 started catchup and couldn't finish it because other nodes ordering with a high load. They stashed a lot of transactions and nodes restarted after 1 hour with out of memory. In this time happened 9,10,11 view changes and pool tried to make 10-12 nodes primary but couldn't because nodes restarted and pool was forced to start a new view change again and again. It took about 30 min and in this time all nodes had stashing all client messages. After this all nodes restarted with out of memory problem.  It problem was solved with next ways: * Discarding client requests in view change * Fix bug with a lot of View Changes because of master degraded.   ></body> </Action>

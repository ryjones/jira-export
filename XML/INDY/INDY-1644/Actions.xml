CDATA *PoA:*  Need to find out maximal pool performance for each type of transactions.  Load should run using  spike load test|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/scripts/performance/perf_load/perf_spike_load.py .  Initial load rate (see spreadsheet in description) was chosen as load which expected to be successfully processed by pool. Load should increase by 1 txn/sec per 0.5 hour. Load test should be stopped when client will consistently give timeout errors. Maximal pool performance will be obtained from node metrics and load script statistic, as performance in the last period when performance of the pool was equal to load rate produced by the load script.  Spreadsheet in the description will be used to track results.  Note that testing of cases with fees will not make sense until fix of ST-497/INDY-1874.  ></body> </Action>

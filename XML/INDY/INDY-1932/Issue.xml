CDATA Environment: indy-node 1.6.738  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup the pool with config described in  comment|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1836?focusedCommentId=54799&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-54799  to INDY-1836, but do not stop any nodes. 2. Run the production load.  Actual Results: Pool stopped working after 12 hours of load because of INDY-1926, but before this following warnings were appeared in logs: {code:java} 2018-12-19 02:11:16,815|WARNING|node.py|Node20 raised suspicion on node Node10 for Commit message has invalid BLS signature; suspicion code is 31 .... 2018-12-19 02:11:17,188|WARNING|node.py|Node20 raised suspicion on node Node17 for Commit message has invalid BLS signature; suspicion code is 31 {code} Note that test was started at 2018-12-18 16:08:00 and pool worked without any issues during ~10 hours.

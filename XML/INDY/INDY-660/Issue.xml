Offer a claim to one of my connections. (This is the equivalent of sending an invitation to send me a claim request)Examples:-A business invites Alice to request a claim containing its valid business license-Joe offers a claim to Alice saying she has blonde hair.-Alice&apos;s doctor offers her a claim saying she is in good health.-Alice&apos;s insurance company offers her a claim saying Alice is defensive driver.-Ebay issues Alice a claim saying she has 99.98% positive seller feedback.-Patrons offer claims to a restaurant saying it has great service.-Movie critics offer claims to their connections saying a certain movie was worth watching.*POA*_Assumptions_* sender knows endpoint and verkey of receiver* standard claim definitions are already established and mutually agreed upon by all parties involved_POA steps_* Create a CLI command `offer claim &lt;claim-name-version&gt;`. Add a command in sovrin cli. In file sovrin/cli/cli.py, add regex to interpret cli command, add it to lexers and completers. Add command action handler.* offer command handler will get the claim from available claims and will send to receiver* On receiver agent create a handler that accepts incoming claims, cli will need to register to this event, and call already created method which receives claim after `accept invitation`. Once we have available claims added via same method call after `accept invitation`, it will be printed on cli and user can request claim, if he wants." priority="3" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:23.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:31.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:31.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19848"/>

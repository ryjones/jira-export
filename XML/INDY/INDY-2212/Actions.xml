CDATA *PoA:* # Try to increase the timeout when binding a listener socket from 10 secs to 120 secs  # Consider pyzmq update to the latest version (we use 17.0.0 but the latest version is 18.1.0)  I think ZMQ needs to be updated because of the following reasons: *  https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.2.4:  fix race condition with ZMQ_LINGER socket option (looks similar to the issues we see) *  https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2:  a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected. Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Changes:* * Iincreased the timeout when binding a listener socket from 10 secs to 120 secs  *PR:*   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1302   *Risk:* Low  *Recommendation for QA:* * Run load with a lot of client requests so that client stack is restarted quite often. Make sure there are no errors. * Run similar tests in Docker (scripts/client_connections/just_connect_N_times.py can be used).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: 1.10.0~dev1070  Steps to Validate: 1. Run reading load test with 1000+ simultaneous connections against 25 nodes AWS pool. 2. Run reading load test with ~400 simultaneous connections against 7 nodes docker pool.  Actual Results: There are no `ZMQError: Address already in use when restarting client stack` errors in logs. Client stack reset works as expected.  ></body> </Action>

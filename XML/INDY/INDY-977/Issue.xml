CDATA The larger the size of aÂ ledger the slower the writes per second become.  *Testing Setup* Global pool setup through AWS across as many as 13 regions. 5 Globally dispersed client machines each running Libindy and load testing scripts.  Each client machine using Libindy ran 40 threads each thread sending 10 transactions. So with 5 Libindy machines it was simulating 200 clients each sending 10 transactions for a total of 2,000 transactions.  After each run of 2,000 transactions I would check the transactions per second.  The measurement of transactions per second is done be getting the epoch time stamp from the first transaction that was sent and subtracting it from the epoch time stamp of the last transaction that was sent. The difference in the time stamps gives you the total number of seconds.  Dividing the total transactions by the total seconds of what was committed to the ledger gives the number of transactions per second.  I ran only with a 7 node pool. The results are in increments of 2,000 transactions on the ledger.  *Results of Test* I will only show every 10,000 in this chart, but it steadily declines. ||Ledger Size||TXNs per Second|| |2,000|53| |10,000|36| |20,000|21| |40,000|10| |60,000|9|  ></description> </Issue>

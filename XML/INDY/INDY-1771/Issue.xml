CDATA Currently tests are performed using molecule and its vagrant driver only. It makes sense to have docker based way as a default to speed up development since docker containers are much lighter than vagrant VMs. Also it might be useful for future integration into CI pipelines.  Acceptance criteria: * tests can be run on docker containers as a default scenario * tests are passed  ></description> </Issue>

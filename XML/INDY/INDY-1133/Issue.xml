CDATA Our pipelines for indy core have several stages each processed on Jenkins agents which are one-time on-demand OpenStack minions on Hyperledger Jenkins.  As long as new agent launching is quite slow operation need to: * investigate how it actually happens on Hyperledger Jenkins for our case * optimize  Optimization options: * optimize pipelines according to Hyperledger Jenkins specific * ask Hyperledger Jenkins admins to make number of hyp-x agents always available * ask Hyperledger Jenkins admins to allow reuse of launched agents  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Problem reason: - ci pipelines performs a lot of separate stages each required new CloudStack minion  Changes: - indy jobs now use specific CloudStack template which is terminated only after half an hour idle state, thus it can be re-used  Risk factors: - Nothing is expected.  Risk: - Low  Recommendations for QA: do the following sequence of steps * trigger a build for any indy project PR adding "test this please" comment * check on  https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/indy/  that a job was triggered and Jenkins agents are re-used (check for 'running on' phrase in console log)  ></body> </Action>

Trigger a build for any indy project PR adding "test this please" comment. 2. Check on https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/indy/ that a job was triggered and Jenkins agents are re-used (check for 'running on' phrase in console log).  Actual Results: Jenkins agents are re-used in ci jobs.  ></body> </Action>

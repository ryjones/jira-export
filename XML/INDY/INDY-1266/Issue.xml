CDATA Possible cases: # Stop backup primary (doesn't affect backup primary work - expected behavior) # Blacklist backup primary ## Possible way of blacklisting node: ### Fake ledger ### Change node keys (not sure that this will work) ### *!* Changing system time on the node will not result node blacklisting. PRE-PREPARE with wrong time will be rejected, but if the pool will be able to write transaction without the node with wrong time, transaction will be written. It also will be written on node with wrong time because it will found sufficient PREPAREs. # Demote backup primary ## Demote backup instance when F won't change *** Adding new node ## Demotion of backup instance lead to F change *** Adding new node  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA PoA:  Option 1: Split pool_get_logs playbook into 2 playbooks for summary and for the whole data and perform jctl and log `grep` remotely, add default metric plotter to setup.py, plot figures remotely, save all results (grepped files and figures) and pull it using the first script. Maybe it will be reasonable to run perf_res_processor script in the first playbook too to avoid 2 separate runs.  Option 2: Use ansible python3 package instead of yaml playbooks (to keep all actions and logic in python files) and implement 2 scripts described in Option 1 in python not in yaml.  ></description> </Issue>

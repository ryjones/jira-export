CDATA We are unable to send a pool upgrade transaction if you do not include all nodes that have ever been a part of the pool. If you have a node that has been demoted from the pool you cannot send an upgrade transaction without including it in the transaction.  # Create a pool with 4 nodes.  # Add a 5th node to the pool. # Remove the 5th node from the pool by demoting it. # Now try to send a pool upgrade transaction to just the 4 nodes in the pool.  *{color:#d04437}Error{color}* You will get an error message telling you that all the nodes must be in the transaction. The issue is the 5th node is no longer a part of the pool.  We have a "force=True" parameter that would allowed the transaction to be sent, but that option has issues and cannot be used.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As of now, a client needs to create key and value (how they are stored in State Trie) from a Replies DATA depending on the transaction type. It makes the client code (indy-sdk in particular) dependent on the current structure of the State Trie. One of the options on how we can get rid of it is sending KEY together with the DATA in each Reply. But we must be sure that malicious Node didn't replaced the KEY with something wrong. So, the KEY should be a part of VALUE in State Trie, that is signed by multi-sig.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need to have more intensive testing of the current view change protocol: * that view is changed on performance degradation; * that view is changed on disconnections of primary; * that view change works properly with random delays; * that view change works properly when some nodes in the pool are down; * that view change happens when primary behaves maliciously (sends incorrect data for example); * we need to test it also in a quite large and distributed pool  We need to design more scenarios and test them.  ></description> </Issue>

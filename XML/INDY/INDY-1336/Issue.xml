CDATA PBFT View Change assumes that ppSeqNo is not reset in new views. Plenum starts ppSeqNo from 1 on each new view.  We need to have Plenum not resetting ppSeqNo to have correct checkpoints after view change  Acceptance criteria: * Keep (viewno, ppseqno) as 3PC key, but do not reset ppseqno on new views. * Compare based on ppSeqNo only ** check all Validators * do not clear checkpoints after view change * do not reset stable checkpoint (in `reset_checkpoints`)  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We confirmed that the current release of Indy Plenum depends on Indy Crypto 0.4.3 in the Setup.py used to generate the Debian package. We quickly checked the master branch to confirm that the Sovrin package is correctly pinned to Indy Node which is pinned to Indy Plenum.  Things to check: * Can we identify which machines are running Indy Crypto that is not version 0.4.3? What versions are they running? * Where there warnings during the upgrade process on those machines? * Are their sources list correctly defined? * Retest that the upgrade procedure updates Indy Crypto properly.   ~mgbailey  Can you assist with the first three questions while we work on the last one?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Yes, this is an issue, and very critical. The proposed solution: 1) A ticket for IS team (who build python3-indy-crypto) to pin libindy-crypto correctly when building python3-indy-crypto deb package.  2) Hotfix to Sovrin for the current release to fix the issue with the next Upgrade.

CDATA For the TestNet, I suggest manual remediation until this is fixed. Since there are few stewards on that network, I can easily ask them to run: "sudo apt install libindy-crypto=0.4.3".  Since the MainNet is still at indy-node 1.3, soon to upgrade to 1.6, I am not sure if we should do the same there.  ></body> </Action>

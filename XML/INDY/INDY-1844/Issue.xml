CDATA Thanks so much to those in the Indy community who hang out on Slack and RocketChat to let us know things like when updates are coming and also the live status of the networks â€“ is there a problem with STN? Slack is the best place to check.  But I think the users of these networks would prefer to be able to get either a JSON or HTML-ified display of the health of the network at live status.  If JSON output is allowed, it would be very easy for folks who rely on the network to connect in their support team's existing alerting systems to this endpoint and get alerted whenever there's a network-level problem.  As per a few other issues I've opened, I don't think this should require compiling the Indy SDK and writing your own script. Yes, that's possible, but as service providers these days, people are expecting more.  INDY-1819 should (in the related for this issue) should help achieve this goal. If each validator node can be monitored without a specialized SDK, then the monitoring of the network becomes a much easier task.  Some may argue or feel that this issue is more related to Sovrin or the Sovrin Networks specifically as opposed to the Indy Node. I've not seen a project or JIRA board where I can open issues related to the Sovrin network directly, so I'm using this forum.  ></description> </Issue>

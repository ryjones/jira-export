CDATA One node starts catchup and sending catcup reqs to other nodes. Receives some replies from fast nodes, writes some txns and waits for the rest replies. As long as timeout expires node regenerates catchup reqs but with updated staring seqNo. After that node receives replies from fast nodes and responses from slow nodes for the previous catchup request. As a result node has several catchup responses with overlapping sqeNo intervals. See  INDY-1403|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1403   ></body> </Action>

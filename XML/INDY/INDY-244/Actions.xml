CDATA Tested scenarios when 3PC-messages ({{PROPAGATE}}, {{PREPREPARE}}, {{PREPARE}}, {{COMMIT}}) are sent repeatedly. Checked multiplied repeated sending with no delay and with a delay that causes repeated 3PC-messages to get mixed with newer 3PC-messages (including newer {{ORDERED}} messages). Checked repeated sending from one node in the pool and from all the nodes in the pool.  Found no bugs. Repeated messages were discarded by receiving nodes in all the verified cases.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="26760" issue="18142" author="spivachuk" type="comment" body="Also I would like to make clarification about {{AssertionError}} that I observed on June 16. It occurred when repeated {{ORDERED}} messages (gotten using changes in source code of plenum) were mixed with newer {{ORDERED}} messages. But {{ORDERED}} messages are not transferred via a network, {{ORDERED}} is an internal message inside a node. This is a message from a replica to the node containing it. So the case with repeated {{ORDERED}} messages was synthetic and may not occur due to network troubles. Thus that {{AssertionError}} did not represent a bug." created="2017-06-19 15:32:51.0" updateauthor="spivachuk" updated="2017-06-19 15:32:51.0"/>

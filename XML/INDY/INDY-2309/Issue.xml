CDATA Option 1: Do not verify individual BLS sigs in commits: - Verify aggregated BLS sig only when receive a quorum of commits (in assumption that in most of the cases it's valid) - If aggregated BLS sig is invalid, then validate each individual COMMIT  Option 2: Validate BLS sigs on Primary only - Do not validate BLS sig for Commits on non-Primary replicas - Do not calculate aggregated BLS sig on non-Primary replicas while Ordering - If a Primary doesn't have requests to be sent when it's time for the next Batch, but there are requests on the previous batch ordered (so that BLS aggregated sig is not calculated for them yet), then send a Freshness empty batch now (doesn't wait till the next Freshness check).   ></description> </Issue>

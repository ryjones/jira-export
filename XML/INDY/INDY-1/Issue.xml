CDATA Welcome to Indy, the only technology designed from the ground up to enable privacy-respecting independent identity (including self-sovereign identity) for people, organizations, and things.  Indy technology powers Sovrin, a global public utility governed by the Sovrin Foundation, which makes Independent Identity possible for everyone. Combined with verifiable claims, Independent Identity enables any person, organization, or thing to connect directly to any other person, organization, or thing, and to interact with trust and privacy.  If you've gotten this far you probably already know, Indy and Sovrin incorporate leading-edge technologies such as:  * Permissioned distributed ledger technology engineered for identity to support strong, continuous, contextual, and multi-point authentication * First class support for verifiable claims * Zero-knowledge proofs, for privacy-respecting claims exchange, portability of claims, and selective disclosure * Cryptographic accumulators, for revocation of claims  Now that these technologies have come together, previously intractable privacy, fraud, and security problems can be fundamentally addressed, and entirely new and exciting paradigms for interaction become possible.  Thank you for helping with Indy... together we'll change the world!  Timothy Ruff & Jason Law (CEO and CTO of Evernym, inventors of Indy and Sovrin)  ></description> </Issue>

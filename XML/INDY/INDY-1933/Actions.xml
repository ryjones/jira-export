CDATA Founded problem:  When few backup replicas stop ordering at the same time, MedianLowStrategy is incorrect way to measure backup replica faulty, because it may cause situation when we can not distinguish if replicas degraded or not.   Solution:  We can solve this problem, by using MedianMediumStrategy for measuring backups and left MedianLowStrategy only for master  PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1080   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Req for QA: * Run pool of 7 nodes (f = 2, r = 3) * Send 1 txn * Load backup primaries nodes with some task ( "stress -c 10 -i 10 -m 10" for example. stress can be installed from apt) * Run a little load test (~200 txns) * If there were no view_change, ensure that every node deleted 1 and 2 replicas ( and only master - 0 left) else talk with me about changing test case  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.803  Steps to Validate: 1. Run pool of 7 nodes (f = 2, r = 3). 2. Send 1 txn. 3. Load backup primaries nodes with some task. 4. Run a little load test (~200 txns).  Actual Results: There are no VCs and both backup replicas are deleted on each node. !INDY-1933.PNG|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

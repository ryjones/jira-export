CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.747  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Run following load tests from 4 machines: client 1: writing 10 txns/sec during 1 hour and sleep for 2 hours (production mix); client 2: writing 1 attrib/min, like on live pool; client 3 and client 4: reading 50 txns/sec from each machine.  *Actual Results:* Pool stopped writing after several days of spike load. Most part of the nodes wrote 338512 txns in domain ledger, 3 nodes were lagged: persistent_node1 331698 persistent_node5 331457 persistent_node9 307915  *Additional Information:* Note that first attempt to run spike load test was unsuccessful and spike load was started later than the rest ones.

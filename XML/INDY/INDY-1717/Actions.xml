CDATA Following load testing was performed: * Production load without fees (Live-20-11-18-production-mix-no-fees):  ** 270K txns were written during ~10 hours of load. Pool was in consensus after the end of load, but several nodes were lagged: INDY-1865 was created for investigation of this problem. * Production load with fees (Live-20-11-18-production-mix-fees): ** 30K | 75K txns were written during ~2 hours of load. Pool was broken after the load: INDY-1867 was created for investigation of this problem.  Since we have some problems with production load with fees, it will not make a lot of sense before investigation and fixing of INDY-1867. Not tested cases from PoA of this ticket will be covered in scope of INDY-1644. So, this ticket is moved to Done.  ></body> </Action>

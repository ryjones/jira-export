CDATA Following the upgrade to to 1.2.50, the live Sovrin network is no longer processing transactions.  In particular, we are not able to do "send NODE" to configure the BLS keys.  For example, shortly before Wed Jan 24 21:18, I sent the following transaction:  {code:java} indy@live> send NODE dest=GWgp6huggos5HrzHVDy5xeBkYHxPvrRZzjPNAyJAqpjA data={'alias':'ev1','blskey': '2zg4ufG8iyn5BQfh1YsutZqEB4QdZt8NUvef9CX7VrqCKHsfxY2muPY3LSGbBshqB6sfvXa7zXVPFUjM1ZcZmc2RFpSKsRNQC1shGA6yLhtkG5UUkNCRfXMd2UsuLu8x1pi7fHQaD ioPQ8WxUf4YiJT8BuPx6RyfYRtyvuvJxr2UwBL'} Sending node request for node DID GWgp6huggos5HrzHVDy5xeBkYHxPvrRZzjPNAyJAqpjA by J4N1K1SEB8uY2muwmecY5q (request id: 1516830370402348) indy@live> {code} No response was received at the cli.

Also, ev1 is the first node in the genesis file, so I would expect it to be the primary.  This is not the case, and in fact the logs show that the primary has changed several times in the last few hours.     ></description> </Issue>

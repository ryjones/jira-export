CDATA As of now, Replicas discard PrePrepares received during catch-up.  So, if catch-up is long enough, it may lead to infinite catch-ups and a lot of requests for missing PrePrepares, since during a high load the pool may order a lot.  Also we should not process Checkpoints during catch-up  *Acceptance criteria* * Add tests to make sure that a Node can order and apply all requests and 3PC messages received during catch-up * Simplify processing of 3PC messages during catch-up: ** Stash all 3PC messages and Checpoints during catch-up ** Once catch-up is finished - process them  ></description> </Issue>

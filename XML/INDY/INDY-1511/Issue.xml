CDATA Take down backup primaries (replicas) and then the primary.  Details from  ~krw910 : In a 10 node pool you will have a primary node indicated in the logs as :0 and three of what I call backup primaries. :1, :2, :3. Since we do round robin it would start the pool like the following: Node 1:0 - Primary Node 2:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if node 1 goes down or a view change is requested) Node 3:2 - Backup to node 2 Node 4:3 - Backup to node 3  Since you can lose 3 nodes in a 10 node pool the test scenario would be to lose 2 of the 3 backup nodes then take down node 1 which is the primary. The remaining backup node should become the primary after the view change. and as the nodes you took down come back online new backup nodes (in round robin fashion) are selected.  ></description> </Issue>

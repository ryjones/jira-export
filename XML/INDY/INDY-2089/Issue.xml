CDATA Since Indy-Node and Indy-Plenum are tightly coupled, we need to make sure that all integration tests from Plenum (there are a lot of them) pass in Indy-Node too, so that Indy-Node doesn't break Plenum's core functionality.  Â   Possible options: * Run all Indy-Plenum CI/CD tests on every master build of Indy-Node  * Run all Indy-Plenum CI/CD tests on every RC build of Indy-Node  * Have nightly builds running all the tests  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need a signal or alarm (external measure) when a pool stops functioning. If the pool is no longer accepting new transactions or unable to perform a read action.  *Basic Requirements * Pick a timeframe, 60/90 mins, then an alarm goes off.  Introduce a simulation for this.  Keep rotating a key on a test account.  When a transaction cannot be written, have an email sent. Need to define who should be in the email list and how it is controlled. Need a system that shows the exact way it works externally.     ></description> </Issue>

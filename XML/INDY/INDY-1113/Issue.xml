CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.282  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Emulate slow view change processing (slow network or sleep() in ~/plenum/server/view_change/view_changer.py). 2. Force multiple view changes by primary restarting until there are 2 view change timeouts expire.  Actual Results: When first view change (forced by primary restarting) falls into timeout error node starts another view change and if this view change also falls into timeout error it looks like there are no any additional attempts to select another primary (you can even shut down current primary after this and other nodes will count it as primary as well).  Expected Results: Pool should retry the primary selection (more attempts or endless loop).  ></description> </Issue>

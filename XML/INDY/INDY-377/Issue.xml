CDATA h6. BUILD  sovrin-node 0.4.9 sovrin-client 0.4.19 h6. STEPS TO REPRODUCE # Add 2 nodes to existing pool from 4 machines. # Demote one node (Node5) withÂ default Trustee (000000000000000000000000Trustee1). # Add NYM and check that transaction was not written to the ledger on demoted node. # Demote another node (Node6). # Make another trustee (000000000000000000000000Trustee9) and check that corresponding transaction was not written to the ledger on Node5 and Node6. # As another trustee promote Node5. # Check that it did make catch up. # Switch to default trustee. # Promote Node6.  h6. ACTUAL RESULT  Node6 did note make catch up. After _sudo systemctl restart sovrin-node_ it did make catch up. See logs of all nodes in attachment. h6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  I tried to reproduce that issue demoting and promoting Node5 with default trustee and repeating steps for Node6 but it wasn't reproduced.  ></description> </Issue>

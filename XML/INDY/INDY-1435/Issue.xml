CDATA Current thoughput measurement in monitor is done as soon as there are a few batches ordered. It turned out that with large enough batches (and max batch size was significantly increased recently due to  INDY-1334|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1334 ) this behavior makes it's possible to enter perptual view change (details are in  INDY-1429|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1429 ).  Things to do: 1) Extract measurement code in monitor into unit testable class and cover it with enough tests, including ones showing problems with current throughput measurement 2) Implement windowed throughput measurements 3) Re-run load tests from  INDY-1429|https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1429  to see if problem is really gone  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Where you are running the sovrin CLI from is a .sovrin directory. In this directory is the pool_transactions file for the sandbox and live pools.  If a user is only using the live environment and only has the pool_transactions_live file then the CLI will not attempt to connect to the live pool. It acts as if there is no pool_transactions file.  Steps: In the .sovrin directory only have the pool_transactions_live file. Start >sovrin Run >connect live  You will get a message showing no file was found and a URL on where to find the files. If you create a pool_transactions_sandbox file in the .sovrin directory and run the steps above you can now connect to the live pool.  ></description> </Issue>

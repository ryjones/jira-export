CDATA * We require f+1 equal CONS_PROOFs to start a catch-up * Under the load, there is a high chance that all nodes will have a different CONS_PROOF (due to different ledger size) * In this case required CONS_PROOFs will be requested explicitly * CONS_PROOFs will be requested in a timeout, which is dependent on pool size and quite big * => This slows down catch-up a lot, especially under the load  *Acceptance criteria* * Decide if we need this timeout at all (especially if we get CONS_PROOFs from most of the nodes) * Remove or reduce timeout * Cover by tests * Do load testing of catchup under the load. Make sure that catchup is faster.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As Alex said, problem is about that one of nym that you've include in multisignature (as I understandÂ _multiple users_), not written in ledger.  And as I've just checked, we can multisig nym txns and write it to ledger. The requirements here is that identifier's (sender) nym must present in multisignature and that every multisig participant's nyms were written to ledger   ~EvelynEvergreene  please open a new ticket if you encounter this problem again with upper satisfied requirements  ></body> </Action>

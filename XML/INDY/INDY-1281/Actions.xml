CDATA We addressed this issue in a different way: * We added a way to check the freshness of query responses * That freshness check also ensures that the network is in consensus * We report that consensus status as part of validator info  This provides significant confidence that the network is properly functioning, but falls short of validating that writes can occur to the ledger. However, as network traffic grows, the need for test writes decreases.  I am closing this issue as "deferred". If it becomes clear that we still need test writes, we can reopen or recreate the issue.  ></body> </Action>

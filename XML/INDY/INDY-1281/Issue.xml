CDATA *Story* As an engineer responsible for the stability of an Indy network, I need to understand if the pool is in consensus even when there are no active transactions being written so that I can diagnose problems before they network is under and active transactions are disrupted.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Add optional parameter for every txn: `test` * Only Maintainer role can send txns with `test=True` * The rules for validation and ordering of txns are the same as for non-test * Execution of test txns doesn't write anything to the ledger (that is it's validated but not applied to uncommitted state)  *DESIGN TODO* As an addition response for this txn can include - send time and start processing time - to detect if pool under high load; - how long it took to process - to be able to notice pool degradation; - what nodes took part in consensus - determine node's availability, performance;Â  <---- an Item for SDK etc  Combine with INDY-933?  ></description> </Issue>

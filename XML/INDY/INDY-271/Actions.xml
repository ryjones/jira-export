CDATA Things tried: - RAM/procssor cores/disk space limitations for one/several/all nodes in pool and for client - Send and get NYM commands execution on pool with limitations  Findings: - Node can't start if there is less than ~100MB RAM for it (so we need at least ~400 MB RAM and 1 processor for the machine with Ubuntu 16 and Docker to start 4 nodes pool) - Node doesn't send/handle any messages to/from other nodes if it runs out of RAM/free disk space/processor time (there are only warnings about waiting for tasks execution in node log) so that node counts as switched off - CLI can't connect to nodes that run out of RAM/free disk space/processor time - There are CLI incorrect behavior and some minor problems with error handling during work with lack of resources (INDY-393, INDY-394)  ></body> </Action>

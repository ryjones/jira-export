CDATA  ~mark.hadley  Sorry for confusion, the error in the schedule is not a problem itself. The problem sounds like "the error message is not clear in case second POOL_UPGRADE comes with name which already exists".  *Steps:* # send POOL_UPGRADE txn with name "NAME" # make sure that the txn was accepted # send yet another POOL_UPGRADE txn with name "NAME"  *Result:* {code:java} Pool upgrade failed: client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest('TRUSTEE cannot do POOL_UPGRADE',) {code} *Expected result:* * The error message should be clear, for example "Upgrade 'NAME' is already scheduled"  {code:java} Pool upgrade failed: client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest('Upgrade 'NAME' is already scheduled',) {code}   * Or we can end up with accepting a POOL_UPGRADE txn with a name which is use already. Maybe having two upgrades with the same name is not a problem. In such a case the txn should be accepted without an error.        ></body> </Action>

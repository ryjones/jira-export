CDATA Size: S (PoA)  In scope of this ticket fix the following issues in the current logic of catch-up: * Execution of 3PC-batch after catch-up in case it was applied before catch-up and then reverted at catch-up start. * Absence of removal of {{PrePrepares}} from {{Replica.stashingWhileCatchingUp}}. * If catch-up is in progress and some ledger catch-up has not been started yet then the node does not respond older {{LedgerStatuses}} for this ledger with {{ConsistencyProofs}} until it starts catch-up of this ledger. * Different quorums for not newer {{LedgerStatuses}} and none-proofs which actually mean the same. * Mode.syncing is used instead of Mode.discovering. * Wrong log message on reaching the quorum of none-proofs in {{LedgerManager.canProcessConsistencyProof}}.  ></description> </Issue>

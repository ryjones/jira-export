CDATA INDY-25 was meant to limit transaction size. The implementation limits the message size and not the individual transaction size to 128k.  *Problem* We need to be able to limit the transaction size by type of transaction and not by the size of the message. One large message could contain several hundred transactions. In the case of the load_test.py script when sending 400 transactions at once a single message is sent and then rejected due to message size.   *Use Case* The best way for users to add large amounts of NYMs to the ledger will be in sending large batches of transactions within a single message. We should be able to break out the message and deal with each transaction individually.  Limiting the size by transaction type will keep transactions within a reasonable range without giving a blanket size to all transaction types. Adding a NYM transaction does not need to be large while adding a schema or CLAIM_DEF will require a large limit.  *Requirement* Limit size of transactions by transaction type and not by message size.     ></description> </Issue>

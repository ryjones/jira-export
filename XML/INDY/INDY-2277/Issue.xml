CDATA We changed the frequency of 3PC batches (PrePrepares) sent fro 1 to 3 secs. This improves stability and performance a lot, but decreases the latency for write requests (throughput VS latency trade off). Once we remove the Replicas, it should be safe to go back to more frequent 3PC Batches and better latency for write requests.  ></description> </Issue>

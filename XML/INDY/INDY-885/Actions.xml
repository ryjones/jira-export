CDATA This work has been completed. The following applicable PR's are here and have been noted in Rocket.Chat. In no particular order:    https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/393    https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/indy-client/pull/265    https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/indy-common/pull/125   All places where the Getting Started Guide has been referenced from any of the current hyperledger/indy-* repos has been updated directly (if it was a Google Doc) or via pull requests for markdown. Some items in the hyperledger/indy-* still point to hypeledger-archives/indy-* for up to date instructions outside of the Getting Started Guide. These have been updated as well and have been included in the above pull requests.   All documentation from the Hypledger Indy Wiki page has been scanned for references to the Getting Started Guide and have been updated where applicable.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~danielhardman  I only updated those old archived products because in the current project/repo, in the Indy-node/setup.md located here:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/setup.md  says to follow the instructions at "Common Setup Instructions".  The link to "Common Setup Instructions" is  https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/indy-common/blob/master/setup.md.    Originally, part of this request came about because someone visited the old Getting Started Guide. This was in part because some of the links still pointed towards the old project. To avoid any further possible misunderstandings, I updated the old Getting Started Guide, among other things, with messages advising that "such and such" has been deprecated with links towards the correct ones.   It is up to whoever is in charge of those decisions to leave those two pull requests closed (they have been closed) or to merge them. I would recommend merging them because those updates do offer clarification. I also recommend them to be merged because in more than one place in the current project/repo – we have instructions telling the user to follow instructions blatantly located in the old archive.   Outside of this, and one I found randomly earlier this morning in the current project, I do not know of anything else that needs to be done in the old archive.   ></body> </Action>

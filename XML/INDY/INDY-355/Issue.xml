CDATA This bug was occurred when running the following test script with the following parameters  {{test_users_write_and_read_own_keys --users 20 --iterations 10}}  using the following configuration: * sovrin-client master 0.3.150 (a local VM), * sovrin-node master 0.3.154 (Shakedown Pool 3).  See the attached logs for details.  NOTE: The following files added in scope of this ticket have been copied manually to the VM with sovrin-client since Jenkins was being off at that moment and so there was no way to issue a new version: * sovrin-client/sovrin_client/utils/ * sovrin-client/sovrin_client/utils/__init__.py * sovrin-client/sovrin_client/utils/user_scenarios.py * sovrin-client/scripts/test_some_write_keys_others_read_them * sovrin-client/scripts/test_users_write_and_read_own_keys  ></description> </Issue>

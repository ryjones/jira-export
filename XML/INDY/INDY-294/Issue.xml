CDATA Right now, if I am looking at two validator nodes and I want to know that their ledgers are perfectly synced, I can do a rudimentary test by doing a linecount of the two ledgers to see if they are equal. However, this doesn't tell us with 100% confidence that two machines are sync'ed, because of anomalies in line breaks in the ledgers.  What we'd like instead is a tool (libsovrin call? API? CLI command?) where I can say to a node: What's the root hash of your state trie?  ></description> </Issue>

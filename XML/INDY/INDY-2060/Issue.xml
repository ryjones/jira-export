CDATA *Test case:* * A node is lagging behind * All nodes start a view change (to view=2 for example) * The node also starts view change * All fast nodes finish the view change pretty fast and start ordering on new view * The lagging node can not finish view change by prepared certificates, but finishes it by timeout only (5 mins), so that by that time all other nodes ordered till, for example,Â  (2, 175)  *Issue 1:* * The lagging node sets watermarks to (0, 300) instead of (100, 400), so that it can not order after 300th batch  *Issue 2:* * The lagging node can not stabilize checkpoints and update watermarks  ></description> </Issue>

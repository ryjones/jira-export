CDATA Another steps to reproduce "Permission denied" error:  1. Login client as agent user. 2. cd /usr/local/bin. 3. sudo ./reset_client (because without sudo there is a "Permission denied" error) => YeS. 4. sovrin.  Actual results: PermissionError:  Errno 13  Permission denied: '/usr/local/bin/cli.log'.  Expected results: CLI should run normally (as it ran before reset client actions).  Workaround: sudo sovrin.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Regarding  ~VladimirWork 's comment: As far as I can see, this situation reproduces only when user _agent_ tries to run sovrin from /home/.sovrin/ directory. When _agent_ runs sovrin from /home/agent/.sovrin/ CLI is successfully started (the reason is in permissions of /home/.sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox file:  {noformat} -rw-r--r-- {noformat}  and owner is root).  I discussed these problems with  ~alexander.shekhovcov  and clarified expected results.  *Case 1* Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install sovrin-client or sovrin-node package as root user.  Actual Results: /home/.sovrin directory is created.  Expected Results: /root/.sovrin directory should be created.  *Case 2* Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install sovrin-client package as one user (e.g. _root_). => .sovrin directory is created for this user. 2. Try to run CLI using _sovrin_ command as any other user (e.g. _agent_).  Actual Results: _agent_ does not have .sovrin directory and pool_transactions files.  Expected Results: /home/agent/.sovrin directory with pool_transactions files should be created when agent tries to run CLI using _sovrin_ command.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The initial problem is still presents: users still have permission denied error, but the reason of this problem is in log files which are written in current directory. There is the ticket for this problem, but in is in backlog since June: INDY-171.  Other problem is in genesis files for client. They are created in following directories now: /home/.sovrin, /home/sovrin/.sovrin, /home/indy/.indy. This behavior needs in additional clarification and it will be clarified in scope of incubation tasks. Anyway, case when the user can't connect to test environment because of absent genesis file has obvious workaround - creation new genesis file using script generate_sovrin_pool_transactions (or generate_indy_pool_transactions in new terminology).  So, current ticket should be closed. Logic with creation of .sovrin and .indy directories and according genesis files will be discussed and clarified in scope of incubation tasks.  ></body> </Action>

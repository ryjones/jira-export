CDATA We had added a non utf8 entry to the ledger as an ATTRIB which caused the services to throw an error and stop incoming traffic. See INDY-15  Now that we have the services running again the entry is still in the ledger for ATTRIBs. When that ATTRIB is read out of the ledger we will have the same issue.  Example input that is now being checked for is in INDY-15 is:  send ATTRIB dest=<NYM> raw={"k2": "v2\x9c"}  However further changes are needed for INDY-15  ></description> </Issue>

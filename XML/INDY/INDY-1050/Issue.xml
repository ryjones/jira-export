CDATA As a follow-up of INDY-974 and INDY-977, we need to perform single-node read/write ledger operations without hard disk (in-memory). At this stage we can determine problems in implementation of tree algorithms by analysis of decreasing of number of read/write operations per second caused by growing number of written records.  ></description> </Issue>

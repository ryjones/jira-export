CDATA Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup the pool with 1.2.50 version. 2. One one of the nodes change _deb  https://repo.sovrin.org/deb  xenial rc_ to _master_ in /etc/apt/sources.list (it is necessary to get not upgraded node like in INDY-1183). 3. Send simultaneous POOL_UPGRADE to 1.3.52 version for all nodes. => One of the nodes was not upgraded, pool is broken. 4. Upgrade not upgraded node manually to the version 1.3.52, send several transactions. => Pool still doesn't work, transactions were not written. 5. One-by-one upgrade nodes manually (due to problem with upgrade INDY-1190). => Pool wrote transactions after upgrade of two nodes. After upgrade of the rest nodes pool stopped writing transactions. 6. Restart the pool. 7. Try to write some transactions.  Actual Results: After manual upgrade and restart the pool only one transaction was written. After that pool stopped writing.  Expected Results: Pool should work.  Possible Workaround: Pool works if manual upgrade (at least nodes stopping and starting) will be simultaneous for all nodes.  ></description> </Issue>

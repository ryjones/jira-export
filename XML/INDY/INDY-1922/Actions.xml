CDATA We've reproduced situation from INDY-1918 and check what problem with validator_info appears. It seems to be the same that described in description of ticket. We've made fixes for this problem in PR below. I think that this would be enough for closing this ticket. But it would be nice if  ~lbendixsen  or  ~mgbailey  provide any logs from node or validator_info history, so we ensure that this is the right problem.

CDATA Rec for QA:  * Run 4 nodes pool with config VALIDATOR_INFO_UPGRADE_LOG_SIZE = 2. For best case you can set different size on different node * Schedule and perform few upgrades (>2) * Get validator info from nodes and check that upgrade log size cropped and is not more than config value.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.753 -> 1.6.754  *Steps to Validate:* 1. Set up the pool of 4 nodes. 2. Schedule several upgrades and wait when they will be applied. 3. Set different values of VALIDATOR_INFO_UPGRADE_LOG_SIZE (2, 5, 0, default) in nodes configs. 4. Run ledger get-validator-info from indy-cli.  *Actual Results:* If VALIDATOR_INFO_UPGRADE_LOG_SIZE=X is specified in config and X value differs from 0, than X rows are shown in validator-info reply. If VALIDATOR_INFO_UPGRADE_LOG_SIZE=0 is specified in config, whole upgrade log is shown in validator-info reply. If VALIDATOR_INFO_UPGRADE_LOG_SIZE is not specified in config, 10 rows are shown in validator-info reply.  ></body> </Action>

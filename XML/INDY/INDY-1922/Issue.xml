CDATA A node, sovrin.sicpa.com, had an issue that prevented it from upgrading properly during the last upgrade via trustee transaction. A side effect of this failure was that a thousand or so attempts to upgrade were done by this node before we were able to stop it. That is the subject of a different ticket (INDY-1918).Â   Following remediation of this issue and manual upgrade of the validator, attempting get-validator-info fails to respond. The logs on the validator show a warning that the message is too large to transmit. I believe that the underlying issue is that one of the items reported in validator-info is a table of upgrade attempts. If, as I suppose, this is causing the message to become too large if there are many upgrade attempts, the table should be limited or truncated before transmission to prevent this message size overflow.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Running through the Getting Started Guide in the Test Environment, code says "claim" when Getting Started Guide says "proof."   This appears in the "send proof Loan-Application-Basic to Thrift Bank" section. The bank is requiring further proof for her Loan-Application-KYC item, not a claim. The documentation is correct in this case, but the code is not.  See screen shot.         ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Do not send as many propagates as of now. * Primary still uses finalized requests to be included into PrePrepare * Non-primaries process requests from PrePrepare if they are aware of it (either received a request or at least one Propagate). This is a step towards Aardvark protocol. Also we have digital signatures, so are sure requests came from the clients. In order to check that Primary doesn't skip any requests, other means and checks are needed in any case (regardless if this is RBFT or Aardvark), and this has nothing to do with finalized requests. * Return even non-finalized requests when processing Propagate MessageReq    ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The current approach is to update the "genesis transactions" to cut the pool ledger at a given time to be the initial state of the pool ledger.  Over time, the size of that file will grow to an inelegant size, but it isn't an immediate concern. (As a note, the number of nodes should always be greater or equal to n-F of the current pool size.)  Changing this behavior will require a change in the catch-up protocol and a change in the communication with clients using libindy.  The Evernym team would be happy to work on the architecture with someone else who wants to work on it, but our current backlog has more immediate concerns.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When an administrator is bringing up a validator node for the first time and joining it to a network, pool and domain genesis files are used for bootstrapping. The transactions of these genesis files are used as the first transactions on the local copy of the ledger being created on the the validator, and thus must be identical to the first transactions on the global ledger.  This should be changed as follows: # Add a "current pool" file which will contain information similar to the pool ledger, but contains information only on validators that are currently active in the pool. This file will provide connection information for bootstrapping new nodes # When a new pool is being brought up for the first time, the current pool file will be identical to the genesis file # After the pool ledger download is complete, catchup will be used to create and populate the other ledgers, as is currently done. # A utility script should be provided that can be run to verify that the current pool file is  valid, based on the contents of the pool and domain ledgers     ></description> </Issue>

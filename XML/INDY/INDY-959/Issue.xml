CDATA On the STN network, a trustee demoted a validator node in the ledger in preparation of moving the validator from the STN onto the live network.  A few hours later it was noticed that the validator was once again connecting to the STN.  A new, apparently un-initiated transaction is now on the ledger, which appeared on the ledger during a view change.  Here is the timeline:  17:07 Trustee posts a transaction to ledger demoting 'esatus'  19:23 View change occurs, seemingly re-writing the 'esatus' node data to the ledger  19:23 'esatus' reconnects  One node has low-level logs available, which are attached. Logs on all other nodes look similar, so a representative is attached.  Logs from the esatus validator will also be attached, when we get them.  The pool ledger is attached.  ></description> </Issue>

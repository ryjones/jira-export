CDATA Superficial scrutineering via SonarQube revealed quite a lot pieces of strange code. It may be just typos, but also potential causes of complicated bugs. Easy solution is just to replace these code, but it can just to hide a symptoms of structure problems.  *Plan of attack:* 1. Do scrutineering again 2. Prepare separated PR's for each type of code smell (because of potentially big amount of files per PR or merge conflicts) 3. Check that replaced code is not a symptom of tricky problem  If it prove itself, it also good to add it to CI  ></description> </Issue>

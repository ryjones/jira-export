CDATA Some of packages in Evernym PyPI account miss such important metadata as license, description... Need to review the following packages data and update: * indynotifieremail: A tool for stewards of an Indy network to be notified by email when a traffic spike is detected. * sovrinnotifierawssns: A tool for Sovrin Stewards to receive notifications. * sovrin-client-rest-dev: A library that can be used by a Sovrin client application to check the status of the validation pool. * sovrinnotifieremail: A tool for Sovrin Stewards to be notified by email when a traffic spike is detected. Also see the package indynotifieremail. * sovringui: A helper to build GUIs for checking the Sovrin pool status.  Acceptance criteria: * ensure that each PyPi listing specifies the Apache license,Â  thelink to the source code and use the description provided above  Options:  Seems there is only one option: * reach out the source code (I believe all of them shoould ave some GitHub rpeository) * update their metadata * use `twine` to upload changes to PyPI as new releases  Additionally here a quote from PyPI: {quote}Project description and sidebar To set the 'indynotifieremail' description, author, links, classifiers, and other details for your next release, use the setup() arguments in your setup.py file. Updating these fields will not change the metadata for past releases. Additionally, you must use Twine to upload your files in order to get full support for these fields. See the Python Packaging User Guide for more help. {quote}  ></description> </Issue>

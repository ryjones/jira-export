CDATA  ~esplinr   I checked urls to sources for that repos (also I checked `sovringui`). Here is the results: * indynotifieremail, sovrinnotifieremail ** url:  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-notifier-email  ** `indynotifieremail` was `sovrinnotifieremail` renamed in scope of INDY-995 * sovrinnotifierawssns ** url:  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-notifier-awssns  ** repo is private * sovrin-client-rest-dev ** url:  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-client-rest  * sovringui ** repo is private ** url:  https://github.com/evernym/sovringui  * sovrin_installer ** url:  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-installer-priv   Thus, all these packages are not presented in both Sovrin Foundation and Hyperledger repos.  I think we should decide who owns them in both GitHub and PyPI and update/delete then.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Todo: * Discuss with Mike B whether these are still used * Delete unused pypi packages * Make the private Evernym repos public * Turn over the maintained pypi packages (indy-node and indy-sdk) to Sovrin Foundation since they are published in the CD pipeline  ></body> </Action>

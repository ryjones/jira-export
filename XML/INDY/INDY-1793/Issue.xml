CDATA Currently, when the node_control tool upgrades a steward to a new version of sovrin, it marks the steward as being upgraded to that version and will not upgrade it again.   However, we need node_control to permit upgrading our steward multiple times because we are running our steward as a docker container.   Consider the following sequence of events: 1) Our steward image is built with the latest version of sovrin (e.g. version 1) 2) Our steward is running 3) Sovrin updates to version 2 4) Our steward is upgraded via node_control to version 2 5) Our steward container fails and is restarted from the steward image (version 1) 6) Our steward will not be upgraded again because it was already upgraded once     ></description> </Issue>

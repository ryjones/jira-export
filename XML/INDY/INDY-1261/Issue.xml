CDATA The live network is not posting transactions that are sent to it.  There are no transactions posted since late March.    Ev1, which was probably the primary node, was rebooted at 15:27 on March 30, and a view change resulted.  I suspect that this is a manifestation of the same problem being investigated in INDY-1256.   Attached are logs from ev1.   ></description> </Issue>

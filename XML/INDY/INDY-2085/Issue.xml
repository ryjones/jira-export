CDATA I am testing with Indy-CLI version 1.8.1 and when I send a ledger mint-prepare command without "using" a DID it returns:  *Error: Invalid structure*    *Caused by: Plugin returned error*  So then I created an unprivileged DID and prepared the mint transaction using that DID. I then got three trustees to multi-sign the txn.  I then tried "ledger custom <txn>" while using a Trustee DID and the response was:   *Transaction has been rejected: validation error  SafeRequest : The identifier is not contained in signatures*  So I added a signature for the unprivileged DID that was in the "identifier" field along with the three TRUSTEE signatures and got the following error (It might be appropriate for this last to be a separate ticket since I had the required number of TRUSTEE signatures and the command still did not work...)  *Transaction has been rejected: client request invalid: InsufficientCorrectSignatures(3, 4)*  I tried a few other things but could not get the CLI to post the transaction with the unprivileged DID.    Expected result:  I should be able to send a mint-prepare command without a DID.  Actual result: mint-prepare requires a DID and my testing shows that it probably has to be a TRUSTEE DID.     ></description> </Issue>

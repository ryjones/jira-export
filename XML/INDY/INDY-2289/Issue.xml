CDATA *Issue Description*  Today we use monitor sockets for: # detecting and getting a list of disconnected/unreachable nodes (in Validator Info for example) # triggering a View Change when a Primary is disconnected  This logic seems to cause some unexpected behavior in zmq (like zmq not being able to reconnect by itself - INDY-2261), so we need to see why monitor sockets are preventing this, and fix it.  If there is no conclusion the logic for which we are now using monitor sockets should be implemented with heartbeats.  *Note*  An issue for the monitor behavior is opened with PyZMQ community: *  https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/1340   Check the status of this issue before making changes to the code because it can potentially provide us with * an easy fix if we are not using monitor sockets correctly, or * a new version without this problem  if this turns out to be the case, this ticket should be ignored and a follow up should be created.  *Acceptance Criteria* * zeroMQ auto-reconnection works * All existing tests pass * New logic covered with unit and integration tests  Â   ></description> </Issue>

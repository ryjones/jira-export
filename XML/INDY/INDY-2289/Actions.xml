CDATA Problem reason/description: - zeroMQ reconnection did not work - monitor socket blocked entire zeroMQ lib  Changes: - monitor socket closed when we notice that there is no connection to a remote  PR: -  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1422   Version: - Plenum:Â  1.12.1.dev970  Risk factors: - networking not working or working differently - re-connection not working - existing behavior in relation to message delivery changed  Risk: - High  Covered with tests: - Test ref on github  Recommendations for QA - system tests - perf tests - manual re-connection tests with a pool of nodes if necessary (simple reconnect, requests sent during node disconnect, view change events, catchup)  ></body> </Action>

CDATA We have test_consensus_n_and_f_changing system test failed intermittently: https://build.sovrin.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/indy-node%2Findy-node-cd/detail/master/1155/tests after merging this fix. It fails always at the same step: we start two nodes to reach write consensus and 15 seconds are not enough for this now (if I change 15 to 30 or 60 tests passes) but before the fix it didn't fail.  ></body> </Action>

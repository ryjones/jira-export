CDATA Build Info: sovrin-client 0.3.145  Overview: Incorrect verkey validation.  Steps to Reproduce - Case 1: 1. Add verkey "8RBNqGxt6TsUL4uHQmpy4r~" to any identifier -> validation error: value length 23 is not in ranges  range(43, 46)  2. Add verkey "~8RBNqGxt6TsUL4uHQmpy4r~" to any identifier -> validation error: should not contains chars other than {%list of chars that doesn't contain ~%} 3. Add verkey ~8RBNqGxt6TsUL4uHQmpy4r to any identifier -> success (but this verkey contains the same 23 symbols as in step 1 and has the symbol that is not in list in the step 2). 4. Add verkey "~" any identifier -> validation error: value length 0 is not in ranges  range(15, 26)   Expected Results: Clarification is needed, see additional info.  Additional info: Why the presence of "~" as the first symbol changes ranges of validation from (43, 46) to (15, 26) and this symbol is not in list of valid symbols?  ></description> </Issue>

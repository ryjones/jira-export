This results in a Connection Request being sent to the PA through the agent connections. At this point, the OG&apos;s pairwise DID and key is written to Sovrin.# PA&apos;s agent receives and accepts the incoming Connection Request. It also writes its pairwise DID and key to Sovrin. It then sends a Connection Confirmation to OG’s agent.# OG’s agent records the connection.* Plan of Attack|https://docs.google.com/document/d/17S5Qo78MpGBUN0UTh6dGzDyGNCTwZUW7LvZ-5vcQxJ0/edit *" priority="3" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:19.0" updated="2019-10-09 09:25:34.0" resolutiondate="2019-10-09 09:25:34.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="19812"/>

CDATA Upgrade to the same version is implemented and checked in INDY-250. Upgrade the pool with some nodes have lesser version than the others also works correctly (e.g. one node is 1.0.69 and other nodes are 1.0.70): - upgrade to 1.0.70 without reinstall parameter makes only one node to upgrade 1.0.69 -> 1.0.70 - upgrade to 1.0.70 with reinstall parameter makes one node to upgrade 1.0.69 -> 1.0.70 and 1.0.70 -> 1.0.70 for other nodes - upgrade to not latest version also works (rechecked in case of regression testing after INDY-250 fix)  ></body> </Action>

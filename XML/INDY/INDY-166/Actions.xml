The writing is fine, but I am really reluctant to release these instructions to alpha stewards, because the way we are telling them to accomplish certain tasks is broken.

I am tempted to fix the code and then revise the doc, rather than releasing the doc as-is." created="2017-06-23 00:20:17.0" updateauthor="danielhardman" updated="2017-06-23 00:20:17.0"/>

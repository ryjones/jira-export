CDATA Build Info: libindy 1.10.1~1213 libsovtoken 1.0.0~77 indy-node 1.9.1~dev1040  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Write revoc_reg_def into ledger. 2. Turn down all nodes in pool except one. 2. Get revoc_reg with timestamp *after* revoc_reg_def was written to ledger. 3. Get revoc_reg with timestamp *before* revoc_reg_def was written to ledger.  Actual Results: Step 2 is successful but Step 3 returns PoolLedgerTimeout error (it reproduces intermittently).  Expected Results: Step 2 and Step 3 both should return replies.  Additional Info: According to investigation from SDK team there is no state proof data in the pool reply in Step 3.  ></description> </Issue>

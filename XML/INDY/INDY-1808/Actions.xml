CDATA lovesh commented on Dec 19, 2016 @AdrienPensart Thanks for pointing this out. The problem is that you are entering status command too early. If you wait for nodes to connect and do the election so you see messages like Beta:1 selected primary ..., Gamma:1 selected primary ..., etc and then enter status, it should work. This issue would be resolved in the next release though, the CLI would be handling this gracefully and not crashing.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA AdrienPensart commented on Dec 20, 2016 Yes, it should not crash in all cases, but don't you know if it will be faster to bootstrap plenum on localhost in the next release ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA lovesh commented on Dec 20, 2016 We might be able to make small gains in speed but i dont think much can be done in the next release, when plenum bootstraps, a leader election happens which means 4 nodes with each sending/receiving a bunch of messages to/from others before they are ready to start accepting requests from clients. But it takes about 3 seconds on my machine to bootstrap, does it take much longer on your machine?  ></body> </Action>

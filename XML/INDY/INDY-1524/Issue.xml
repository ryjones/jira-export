CDATA indy-node 1.5.67 RC libindy 1.5.0~648  ></environment> <description><! CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Run the load test with normal load (10 writes, 100 reads per sec) for 3 hours. 2. Wait for 1 hour. 3. Run one more load test with normal load (10 writes, 100 reads per sec) for 3 hours.  *Actual Results:* After second round of the load test one node (Node 12) was lagged behind others after "cannot allocate memory" error in journalctl. Domain ledger size on all nodes: 252240, on Node12: 245715. One View Change was happened, but it was happened in the beginning of the second test.  *Expected Results:* Nodes should be restored after crashing and should participate in consensus.

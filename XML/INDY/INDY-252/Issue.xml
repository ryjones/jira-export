CDATA The current process of releasing a Stable build once QA has tested it needs to be reviewed.  # Currently once QA has verified the build the QA lead goes into Jenkins and for each component in dependency order approves the build. # Once QA has approved the component an email is sent to the product team. # The product team would then go into Jenkins and do the same thing approving each component in dependency order. # Once product has approved the build an email goes to the TGB group where someone else now runs through the same process. A TGB member goes into Jenkins and approves each component in dependency order. # Now an email is sent to the Trustees # A Trustee then goes into the CLI and send the POOL_UPGRADE transaction which is a large transaction that needs to be configured with the correct parameters.  ></description> </Issue>

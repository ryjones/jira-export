CDATA After updating firewall rules on ev1, a test NYM transaction (DID: 9qFVrUVE1UjgQcvLfdHTLm) was written to the ledger.  The transaction successfully posted to the ledger, but was not found in the ev1 database using read_ledger.  We verified that there was not stale read_ledger data interfering with that tool.  We rebooted the node and observed that the node was able to catch up and get that transaction.  We then posted a second test NYM transaction (DID: 9qFVrUVE1UjgQcvLfdHTLx), and observed that it once again successfully posted to the ledger, but not to the local copy on ev1.  There are numerous WARNING messages in the ev1 logs related to this failure.  Please diagnose this error.  It is preventing proper operation of the ev1 node.  We believe that the firewall changes are not related to the failure since we can see connections from the other validators on the incoming node port.  ></description> </Issue>

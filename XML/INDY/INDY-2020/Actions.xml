CDATA Exploration results: # recently added dependency `packaging` is imported wrongly: its version is 16.6 instead of 19.0 # 19.0 should come from repo.sovrin.org and it is really presented # but there is also another package _packaging_ of version 16.6 installed as part of _python-pip-whl_ debian package (which is a dependency for _python-pip_) # version 16.6. wins 19.0 when pip itself is imported inside plenum/node code since it updates python search path  ></body> </Action>

But that needs more accurate fix since packaging is not only one package installed as wheels with pip and that plenum/node need. " created="2019-03-13 04:25:03.0" updateauthor="andkononykhin" updated="2019-03-13 04:25:03.0"/>

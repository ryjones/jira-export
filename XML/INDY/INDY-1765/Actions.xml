CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.643 indy-perf-load 1.0.16  Steps to Validate: 1. Run writing load test with ~40 NYMs/second without fees. 2. Check metrics, logs and nodes' ledgers.  Actual Results: RAM consumption at all instances is equal. Size of requests' queues is the same as expected.  !1765.png|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

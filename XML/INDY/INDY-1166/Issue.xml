CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.3.51  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool of 6 nodes and send NYM to make sure that pool works. 2. Stop 6th node >> read NYM >> write NYM. 3. Stop 5th node >> read NYM >> write NYM. 4. Stop 4th node >> read NYM >> write NYM. 5. Stop 3rd node >> read NYM >> write NYM. 6. Start nodes from 3rd to 6th successively. 7. Try to write NYM.  Actual Results: Step 7 NYM is not written to ledger so the pool has lost write consensus after descent to f+1 and recovery to >n-f.  Expected Results: Pool should work write NYMs normally after >n-f.  Workaround: Restart the whole pool to write NYMs.  ></description> </Issue>

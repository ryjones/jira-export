CDATA  ~danielhardman   ~jlaw 1   ~stevetolman   ~lovesh   ~ashcherbakov   I created that task after reviewing the code in stp/plenum Â in scope of INDY-358.  I think I found quite serious problem in current architecture related to non proper usage of asyncio.  I would be happy if you check and leave your comments in the doc that I published:   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m0pLAMKWRVdAxZN4ardDKGh_xV0J-0SBP-LCDOeN0M8/edit#heading=h.qapj7lclfhub   Thank you  ></body> </Action>

CDATA As of now transaction's digest is used to uniquely identify the transaction.  Signature (as well as multi-signature) is not part of the digest. This is not a problem for a common (single) signature, but nay cause issues in case of multi-signature: * There is a transaction signed by Trustees 1,2,3, and by Trustees 3,4,5. * Both Trustee 1 and Trustee 4 send this txn * Since multi-signature is not part of the digest, the pool will not be able to distinguish if this is txn signed by 1,2,3, or by 3,4,5. * Some nodes in the pool may select for ordering a txn signed by 1,2,3, and some signed by 3,4,5. Since multi-sig is part of the txn in the Ledger, it will lead to different txn root hashes and different ledgers, so the pool may lost consensus.   *Acceptance Criteria* * Design a solution to the above problem. * Get feedback from the architects. * Create relevant issues in this project.  ></description> </Issue>

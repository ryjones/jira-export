CDATA The validator-info diagnostic script is an excellent addition to the Indy suite.  Here are a few additional features that will enhance its usefulness: # In the verbose human-readable output, indicate the time (which must include the timezone) in ISO 8601 format.  For example: "Current time:    2017-12-15T15:53:00+05:00" # In addition to the DID and verkey, report the BLS public key # Indicate the nodes that are the current primaries.  In the verbose human-readable output, this can be indicated by the primary number in parenthesis after the name of the nodes that are primaries, in this fashion:    {code:java} Reachable Hosts: 10/10 RFCU australia   (1) brazil      (0) canada england     (2) korea       (3) mapleleaf ricFlair singapore virginia {code} For the json output, this could be done using a hash instead of a list for the nodes as shown, or by another means: {code:java} { "RFCU": null, "australia": 1, "brazil": 0, "canada": null, "england": 2, "korea": 3, "mapleleaf": null, "ricFlair": null, "singapore": null, "virginia": null } {code}  ></description> </Issue>

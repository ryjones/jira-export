CDATA  ~esplinr   ~ashcherbakov   ~sergey.minaev   I think I can create a configurable Jenkins job (parameters for dev and rc) and we may start with some longer periods of obsolescence for debian artifacts (e.g. no cleanup for rc and a half a  year for dev). I guess it would be enough to keep necessary space on the server taking into account current release intensity.  Some additional notes:  1) as I have just checked about 80% of space is consumed by non-debian (mostly android and ios) artifacts of indy-sdk:  {{40G     android (sdk) }} {{2.6G    debian (node) }} {{25G     ios (sdk)}} {{639M    macos (sdk)}} {{100K    rpm (sdk)}} {{12G   debian ( sdk )}} {{9.4G    windows (sdk)}}  I think they should be covered by the task as well.  2) It would be nice (or better to say we must) to have a backup solution: either server or   AWS Backup service|https://aws.amazon.com/backup/  which seems more natural for our AWS based infrastructure.  ></body> </Action>

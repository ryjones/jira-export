CDATA When submitting an endpoint using the "build_attrib_request" with a URL as the endpoint (e.g. "https://www.google.com"), the following is returned:  {quote}client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('validation error  ClientAttribOperation : invalid endpoint address (ha=https:\\/\\/google.com) {quote}  It appears that there is a format check in Indy-Node to require the endpoint be in the form <ip>:<port>  As agents are being built, this is becoming a higher priority issue.  DID endpoints for Agents cannot be limited to <ip>:<port> - they can be any sort of URI format, possibly even including a DID.  ></description> </Issue>

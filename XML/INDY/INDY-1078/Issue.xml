CDATA While upgrading the STN from 1.1.43 to 1.2.50 the notifier service sent emails with the following message for each validator: {code:java} Upgrade of node 'korea' to version 1.2.50 has been cancelled due to some reason {code} The cancelation message also appears in the indy logs.  No mention of any issue appears anywhere else, including in journalctl. In spite of the cancelation message, the upgrade occurred at the scheduled time, without issue.  The cancelation message was replicated in a local test pool, which also upgraded correctly.  The insufficient nature of the message has been addressed in INDY-801, but the fact that a cancelation message was issued erroneously, when no cancelation had occurred, is a new bug.  Logs and config ledger are attached.  At the time that the logs and ledger were obtained, not all nodes had completed their upgrades, but all were proceeding normally.  ></description> </Issue>

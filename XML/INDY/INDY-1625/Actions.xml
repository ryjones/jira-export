CDATA We have two cases of backups usage: # Fill the ledger with any data for load testing (restoration of domain ledger would be enough); # Restore backup of Persistent pool for upgrade testing.  In Case 2 we need all ledgers, and we need the same IPs as pool had in the moment of backup creation. So, for this use case we will need an ability to add elastic IPs to nodes.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA plenum/plenum/cli/cli.py Line 261 {code:java} Logger().setupRaet(RAETVerbosity, RAETLogFile) {code} This line causes the CLI tests to fail because it it is closing and reiniting the stdout file descriptor, which is killing pytest's ability to capture output.  Commenting this line resolves the test failures.  If we want to have raet logging, this will need to be investigated.  ></description> </Issue>

Optimizations made in scope INDY-2280 led incompatibility in COMMIT messages, so old nodes were discarding COMMIT messages from upgraded nodes. That was the reason why rolling upgrade from 1.12.0 to 1.12.1 failed. It means that *upgrade from 1.12.0 to 1.12.1 should be forced*." created="2019-12-27 15:00:04.0" updateauthor="sergey.khoroshavin" updated="2019-12-27 15:07:02.0"/>

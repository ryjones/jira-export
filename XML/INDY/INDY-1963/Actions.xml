CDATA Reasons: * need to make more cleanly error messages for authorization  Changes: * changed format of "owner" error messages  * changed "There is no constraint" messages * made other messages more cleanly  Version: * indy-node 1.6.779  Recomendation for QA: * raise "owner" message, for example change verkey by not owner, and check, that auth error looks like " can not touch verkey field since only the owner can modify it" * try to "There is no accepted constraint" error, for example doing some actions by already suspended user. Check, that auth errors for this case looks like "Rule for this action is <description of rule with requirements>"  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.6.779  Steps to Validate: 1. Raise "owner" message, for example change verkey by not owner, and check, that auth error looks like "can not touch verkey field since only the owner can modify it". 2. Try to "There is no accepted constraint" error, for example doing some actions by already suspended user.

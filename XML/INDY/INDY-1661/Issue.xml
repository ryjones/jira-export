CDATA We need to test stability and performance of the Ledger with FEEs enabled.  The load script was extended in the scope of INDY-1636 to support FEEs (FEEs support there will be continued in the scope of INDY-1605, but this is enough to start testing).  *Acceptance criteria* * Run load tests with FEEs enabled  ** NYM write only *** 5 writes per sec *** 10 writes per sec *** 15 writes per sec ** NYM read and write *** 10 writes and 100 reads per sec ** NYM and SCHEMA *** 10 writes and 100 reads per sec * Check for Stability issues * Check for the number of view changes * Metrics output * Performance values  ></description> </Issue>

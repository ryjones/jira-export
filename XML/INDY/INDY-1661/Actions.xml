CDATA *NYM write only (done)* * 5 writes per sec ** Pool processes 5 writes/sec well.

It can do in for some time (less than an hour), but then it become slower and can't reach 15 writes/sec until the load will be cancelled. But when the load was stopped, pool was able to reach up to 25 writes/sec.  Pool worked with 15 NYMs with fees per sec during ~4 hours and processed all requests during ~4.5 hours. 158K txns were written.

But in accordance with previous results it looks like performance and stability under load with fees worse than without fees: || ||Txns written before OOM (10 txns/sec load)||Pool throughput|| |NYMs|at least 419389|at least 20 nyms/sec| |NYMs+fees|273739|14 nyms+fees/sec (with input load 15 txns/sec)|  Ticket for exploration of performance and stability degradation: INDY-1713.  ></body> </Action>

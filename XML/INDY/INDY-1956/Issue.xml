CDATA The flag for ANYONE_CAN_WRITE is currently tracked in the configuration file deployed to each node. If an admin were to change this flag on a single node, bad things would happen.  It is preferable to have this option set on a network-wide basis using the config ledger.  UPD: The new Multi-signature approach doesn't require this flag at all.  *Acceptance criteria:* * Either remove this flag from code (most likely) or move it to config ledger if it's really needed        ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Expected behavior of Ping command in sovrin-cli (as documented in getting started guide) # The ping she sends contains a random challenge.  # The ping also includes Alice’s pairwise identifier and a signature.  # Faber College verifies Alice’s signature.  # Faber College digitally signs that challenge and sends it back.  # Alice verifies that the response contained the same random challenge she sent.  # Alice uses the verification key in the Faber College Link to verify the Faber College digital signature.     Acutal behaviour of Ping Command based on reading the current code: # Ping always sends the nounce for the particular agent link # Ping includes a time based identifier # Rest of behavior is consistent as expected.     So this is either a bug in the CLI or in the documentation.     ></description> </Issue>

CDATA PRs: * Indy HIPE PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/153  * Aries RFC PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/420   The design defines and proposes the following: * Identification scheme (as DID) ** We don't have 100% consensus in community about this, but this looks not critical for the first phase of implementation. * Reference scheme and relationship diagram * Common pattern and structure  Next steps: * Continue implementation on the Ledger side (unified approach proposed in the HIPEs allows to finish it pretty quickly): INDY-2338 ** Some specific validation may be skipped for the first phase * Wait until all Rich Schema objects are designed and examples are provided: INDY-2337 (it will be done by  ~brentzundel  and  ~kenebert  ). * Start implementation on Indy SDK side (aries-indy-vdri most probably) * Resolve unresolved questions, merge HIPEs and RFCs  ></body> </Action>

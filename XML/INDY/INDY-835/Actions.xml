CDATA Changes: * created Jenkinsfile.ci (static code validation + testing), doesn't depends from any Groovy shared library * created Jenkinsfile.cd as a copy of legacy Jenkinsfile * reconfigured pipelines: ** Current pipeline watches only for changes in master and stable repos. It uses Jenkinsfile.cd. ** Added CI pipeline which watches for PRs only. It uses Jenkinsfile.ci ** Created folder as container to hold two pipelines above  PR: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/357   How to test: * checked that all mentioned files are presented in indy-node repo * check configuration of node's  CI and CD pipelines: **  https://ci.evernym.com/job/Indy-Node|https://ci.evernym.com/job/Indy-Node/  ** PRs are built in CI pipeline ** master/stable are held by CD pipeline  Note. Currently CD pipeline uses legacy Jenkinsfile. We can't switch it to Jenkinsfile.cd until changes are merged into stable branch. Will do that after new release happens.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Indy-crypto should expose API to compute aggregate verkey by acceppting a list of verkeys and provide an API to verify multi-sig using aggreated verkey. Thus the node can cache different aggregated verkeys. eg, in a 4 node pool, Node4 will cache  1 for Node1, Node2 and Node3,  1 for Node1 and Node2,  1 for Node2 and Node 3 and  1 for Node1 and Node3  ></description> </Issue>

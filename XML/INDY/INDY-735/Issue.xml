CDATA * We support migration scripts during update  * We support downgrade on apt level (it's possible to install a lower version) * However, migration scripts are always called AFTER code upgrade/downgrade. This is fine for upgrades, but doesn't work for downgrades, since we need to have the current code to call the downgrade migration script. * So, for downgrade cases migration scrip must be called BEFORE code downgrade.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.3.62 rc -> 1.4.64 rc  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Upgrade the whole pool with force=True from 1.3.62 to 1.4.64 simultaneously. 2. Send NYM txn via old or new CLI. 3. Send GET_NYM txns to read NYMs that were added before and after the upgrade. 4. Send SCHEMA txn to the ledger. 5. Send GET_SCHEMA txn to read SCHEMA from Step 4. 6. Send GET_NYM txns to read NYMs that were added before and after the upgrade.  Actual Results: GET_NYM txns from Step 3 returns `NYM not found` for existing NYMs but GET_NYM txns from Step 6 returns correct data for the same NYMs.  Expected Results: GET_NYM txns should work normally in both cases.  ></description> </Issue>

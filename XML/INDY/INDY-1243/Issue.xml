Several processes can open the same storage in read-only mode. It means that it is not necessary to create storage copy by read_ledger script to read all entities. Instead the storage can be opened in read-only mode by read_ledger script if it is a rocksdb storage, but for now read-only option is not supported by our code." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-03-27 10:27:58.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:34:41.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:34:41.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="28920"/>

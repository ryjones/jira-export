CDATA To install and run a test network of nodes on one's computer for development purposes, there are several methods available to use. However, lately only Docker has been supported, and Vagrant has stopped working.Â Several new, interested developers have been caught trying to use Vagrant and failing because they should be following the more-updated Docker instructions instead.  To fix this problem, Vagrant needs to be marked as deprecated in various places in indy-node's Github repository.  ></description> </Issue>

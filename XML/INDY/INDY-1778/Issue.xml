CDATA Evaluate if R3 Corda with BFT consensus (BFT Smart) could be made into a viable replacement for Indy. Timebox the effort to 3 engineering days.  Acceptance Criteria * Brief summary of findings evaluating for review by Richard, Nathan, Daniel, Jason, and the broader community. Discussion should include: ** Pros and Cons ** The state of the project's community ** The current roadmap ** Rough estimate of work required to bring R3 Corda-based solution to the same level as Plenum ** A recommendation on whether to research more or kill the proposal ** Put findings to  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-GuJuew1oUvnlzU7gBPZkF5Ongu92voojPHAPc-pUu8/edit#gid=1455070692   Things to consider: * Research how clients are authorized by ledger * How does this relate to work with observers * How much better is performance * How many nodes would be practical (50? 500? 5000?) * Get feedback from community * Notice: One of PoC goals should be smooth upgrade path  There is already a couple of PoC of integration Indy SDk with Corda-based pool (see, for example,  https://github.com/Luxoft/cordentity ) * Notice: it would be great to be possible to make the client-to-node communication use A2A. We could even go one step further and do the same thing from node to node, though this might be harder.  ></description> </Issue>

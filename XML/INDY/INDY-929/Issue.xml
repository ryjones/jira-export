CDATA When running the validator_info tool to check ledger count it can be 1,000 or more off trailing behind what the read_ledger tool by 1 minute or more.  *Setup* You should be able to use the load_test.py script to generate a load.  If you need the libindy version reply to Kelly Wilson on this ticket for setup information. I had two putty sessions open for the same node.  *Steps* # Run a load against a pool sending a few thousand transactions.  # In one putty session for a node run "validator_info -v" # In the other putty session for the same node run "read_ledger --type domain --count"  *{color:#d04437}Issue{color}* You will notice there is a large difference between the two tools. Keep refreshing the validator_info report and you should notice it takes 1 minute or longer for it to catch up to what the read_ledger tool was showing.      ></description> </Issue>

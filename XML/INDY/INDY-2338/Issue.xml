CDATA According to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/153, it should be possible to implement all Rich Schema objects in a generic way. It may exclude some specific validation dependent on object type, but should be enough to continue efficient implementation on the client side.   *Acceptance criteria:* - create common code for dealing with all rich schema transactions as described in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/153 - specific object-related validation may not be implemented on this phase - re-factor existing Rich Schema code to match the generic approach  ></description> </Issue>

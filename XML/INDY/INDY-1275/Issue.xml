Also if we switch to xz compression (which provides another 5-10 fold compression over currently used gzip) these pauses will be increased to 15-20 seconds. Moving compression into other process will eliminate these problems." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-04-16 13:27:13.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:32:29.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:32:29.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="29428"/>

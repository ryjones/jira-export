CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.1.177  Overview: Incorrect CLI messages due to blskeys rotation.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Update blskeys on nodes of pool one by one. 2. Restart the CLI after each update. 3. Send some NYM txns.  Actual Results: CLI shows messages about connecting/disconnecting of nodes that have updated blskeys (actually, this nodes are not restarted). There are some pauses during NYM adding after CLI restart (~1 minute). See CLI/nodes' logs and screenshot for more info.  Expected Results: CLI should work normally.  ></description> </Issue>

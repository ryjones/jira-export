CDATA Thanks for the feature request.  Instead of adding a limit by number of attributes, we have a maximum size to the transaction (something like 128 KB).  Specifically adding a limit to the number of attributes would allow us to give more helpful errors. But there are many use cases that require large numbers of attributes (healthcare, regulated procurement). Given the wide number of use cases we want to support, we don't think the ledger should be enforcing an arbitrary limit.  We will continue to pay attention to requests like this to see if we should change our position.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Case 1:* promotion of stopped node *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup pool of 4 nodes. 2. Initialize 3 more nodes. 3. Start 5 and 6 nodes. 4. Add 5 - 7 nodes (node7 is stopped). 5. Wait for some time.  *Actual Results:* 3rd replica was removed on all nodes exclude Node1 and Node3. After starting Node7 and writing several txns nothing was changed.  *Expected Result:* Replicas should not be removed without any reason.  Â   *Case 2:* node demotion and promotion back Steps to Reproduce: 1. Initiate View Change to make replicas count consistent on all nodes after Case 1. 2. Demote Node7. => Replica was removed on all nodes (include Node7). 3. Promote Node7 back.  *Actual Results:* After promotion replicas were added on all nodes exclude Node7. After writing several txns nothing was changed.  *Expected Results:* Replicas count should be consistent on all nodes.   *Logs:* s3://qanodelogs/indy-1917 To get logs, run following command on log processor machine:  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://qanodelogs/indy-1917/ /home/ev/logs/indy-1917/  ></description> </Issue>

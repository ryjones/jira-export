CDATA PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/607 Implemented log file compression during rotation, changed default settings: - turned on compression (which provides in most situation at least 8x space savings) - increased amount of files to keep by 5x (so that more data can be kept without increasing space usage) - increased timed rotation interval to one week   ></body> </Action>

CDATA Environment: indy-node 1.3.364 AWS 25-nodes pool  Steps to Validate: 1. Upgrade existing pool to the version with logging changes. 2. Run load tests to check log rotation by size. 3. Keep the pool until the next week to check weekly rotation.  Actual Results: Logs rotation by size still works. All logs (exclude current file NodeX.log) are archived. Weekly rotation works.  Additional Information: There is one issue with logs naming: INDY-1273.  ></body> </Action>

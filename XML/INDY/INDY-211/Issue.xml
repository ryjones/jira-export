CDATA Sovrin-Node is started via the ubuntu service file {code:java} /etc/systemd/system/sovrin-node.service{code} However the python interpreter is not started in Optimise mode it is running in the default 'DEBUG' mode  The entry point python script should be executed with the '-O' option which will ensure it is running in optimised mode.   This will have 2 side effects: # Strip all assert statements. This trades defense against corrupt program state for speed. # Strip all docstrings. So a wee bit of saving on memory requirment     So when triaging we need to consider the bullet # 1, do we want to play safe. Asserts are probably going still crash the program.             ></description> </Issue>

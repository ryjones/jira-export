CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.9.0~dev1008  Steps to Validate: 1. Stop any node in the pool. 2. Schedule forced upgrade from 1.9.0~dev1007 to 1.9.0~dev1008 and wait for it's finish. 3. Start stopped node. 4. Schedule another forced upgrade just for 1 node that was stopped and wait for it's finish.  Actual Results: All nodes are upgraded successfully. There are no exceptions in journalctl.  Additional Info: Upgrade *to* 1007 version also works as expected.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA When we write to multiple ledgers all the time, we create a 3PC batch for all the ledgers at the same time, which increases the probability of out-of-order messages, stashes, lagging nodes, and different time of view change start on nodes.  *Acceptance criteria* * Do not send 3PC batches for all the ledgers at the same time * Send every next 3PC batch in 1 sec, as for the case of writing to 1 ledger. * Freshness updates should also follow this logic and be sent for every ledger not earlier than in 1 sec.  ></description> </Issue>

To blacklist a node from the pool you need to be a Trustee or TGB member and it is a single transaction sent to the ledger. The intent is that the Trustees or TGB would come to a verbal consensus to blacklist a node in the pool. Then a single member can send a transaction to the pool to blacklist the node.*Issue:*The issue with this approach is that any one member has the ability to blacklist the pool down to 3 nodes. With only 3 nodes consensus cannot be reached on any transaction including adding back a node to the pool. *Possible Solution:*Instead of a single transaction maybe have two thirds of the Trustees or TGB members or a combination of both each send a transaction to blacklist a node. Once enough transaction requests for the same event occur that node can be blacklisted. This may not be the right approach it is just an example of how to possibly spread out the power." priority="1" resolution="10200" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:12.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:29.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:29.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19750"/>

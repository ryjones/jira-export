The validation component should validate each field of any message checking that its acceptable, like a view change message should have view no as non-zero +ve integer, similarly for 3 phase messages, ppSeqNo should be non-zero +ve integer, etc. For client requests, each transaction&apos;s fields should be validated, like in a NODE txn, if a node port is given it has to be +ve integer, IP has to be a valid, node nym should be base58, for a NYM txn, dest should be base58 and of acceptable length, same for verkey (consider both types of verkeys)" priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-05-25 12:10:43.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:37:03.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:37:03.0" votes="0" watches="4" workflowId="17104"/>

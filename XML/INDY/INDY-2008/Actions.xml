CDATA *Problem reason:* - Validator-info can't dumb the date if a node is received an InstanceCange message.  *Changes:* - Fix the bug with store  InstanceCange messages. - Add a label for audit ledger in validator info. (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1944?focusedCommentId=57533&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-57533)  *PR:* *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1097  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1183   *Version:* * indy-node 1.6.833 -master * (indy-plenum 1.6.696 -master)  *Risk factors:* - Problem with Node-info in validator-info  *Risk:* - Low  *Test:* * test_instance_change_before_vc * test_validator_info_file_metrics_count_audit_field_valid  *Recommendations for QA:*  Test validator-info script after one node panicked and sent InstanceChange. Section "IC_queue" must contains information that one node votes with some reason. Check validator-info history.  Do view change for all pool  Check that validator-info output has no voters in the section "IC_queue" and all field are filled. Check that all places with transactions count contain an information about audit ledger.  ></body> </Action>

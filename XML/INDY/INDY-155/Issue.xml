CDATA After completing catchup, the new node cannot process new PRE-PREPAREs because it does not agree to the state root mentioned in the PRE-PREPARE, *reportSuspiciousNode | Node6 raised suspicion on node Node1 for Pre-Prepare message has incorrect state trie root; suspicion code is 17* while the other nodes can process this PRE-PREPARE  *Instructions from Kelly for reproducing* I believe it is a transaction. I ran through the GST and added Node 5. I did not have any issues. On a hunch I ran through a test document we run just prior to adding the nodes which is the old ledger demo from January. It covers things like adding an abbreviated verkey  send NYM dest=4QxzWk3ajdnEA37NdNU5Kt verkey= ~8RBNqGxt6TsUL4uHQmpy4r After running through the tests here I ran into the issue on Node 6. After it did a catch up it no longer accepted new transactions, but all the nodes that were in the pool when I ran through the ledger demo are just fine.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Right now, {{sovrin_sign}} and {{sovrin_verify_signature}} can create/verify signatures for the JSON messages that are sent to the ledger. In these methods, a JSON message is serialized to a byte array using a custom algorithm that is not used outside of Indy/Sovrin ledger communication. Also, the signature is automatically inserted into the JSON message.  I think it would be very useful if those methods could be used more generically, to create/verify signatures on any arbitrary byte array supplied by the library user.

CDATA Given I am a Trust Anchor acting as an Issuer I should be able to: # send a special kind of Claim Offer: a Trust Anchor Invitation # I should only be able to send this type of claim offer to an Independent Identity Owner (both Organizational and Individual) # Given the Invitee accepts the invitation by sending in return a Claim Request  (covered in SOV-267), requesting I write a Public Claim of MY Trust Anchor Connection with the invitee. I should then be able to: # Write a Public Claim of MY Trust Anchor Connection with the invitee to the Sovrin ledger. # Send a message to the invitee pointing them to the Public Claim I wrote. # When I receive the Claim Request, which is the invitee's Trust Anchor Invitation acceptance (after step 2), all remaining steps in this story should be automated and I should NOT be able to back out or cancel the invitation. All terms are defined in the  Sovrin Trust Framework|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6if3-JZw8BaRmxm3B9X5mKj_IZPHLqi_khHFOrY-XA/edit#   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Looks like the same problem on pool with 8Gb RAM which was under load from INDY-1343 for 12 hours: s3://qanodelogs/indy-1571-8gb/NodeXX/ indy-node 1.6.70 RC.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Nodes ordered 711192 transactions and stopped on (2, 11351).  A master degraded was a reason for first 3 view changes. After this was start step by step view change to 15 view because nodes can't end view change in time.  The reason of this problem is a big load in validator info script. About 100 seconds for one looper iteration.  Problem should be found in the validator info script and its long time of work.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Node1 blacklisted node15 and node5 what caused a slow work. After this catchup was started and could not stopped because load was a very hight (in the end of catchup pull already ordered new transactions and catchup started again).  In this moment problem with node2 looks like a connection problem.  ></body> </Action>

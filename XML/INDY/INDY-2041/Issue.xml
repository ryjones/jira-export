CDATA Currently we suppress automatic triggering for release-* branches since during the CD pipeline for them new push "service" commits happens that will trigger new CD pipelines builds: * CD pushes release commits where release version 'X.Y.Z' is set * CD may rollback and force push the release commit is something went wrong  Need to implement a better logic to allow auto triggering but deal with possible "service" commits. Options: # find Jenkins plugin and configure Jenkins projects to skip commits by some conditionals,  e.g. build only: ** not-tagged and not from bot user ** OR  not-tagged merge commits # allow triggering for all commits but: ** turn off GitHub notification about build statuses (they actually are not needed) ** abort builds for commits by conditional mentioned above  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA We need to prove that it will be stable under conditions similar to production use.  *Acceptance Criteria* Perform a test of an Indy network that has the following attributes:  * The ledger is pre-loaded with 1 million transactions * Pool size is 25 nodes. * 1K concurrent clients * Over a 3 hour period induce a sustained throughput of 10 write transactions per second and 100 read transactions per second on average (from clients) Write load is a mixture of: ** writing credentials schema (5%), ** writing credential definition (5%) ** revoke registry definition (5%) ** revoke registry update (5%) ** write DID to ledger (20%) ** write payment to ledger (45%) ** write attrib to ledger (15%) Read load is a mixture of: ** read DID from ledger (45%) ** read credential schema (10%) ** read credential definition (10%) ** read revoke registry definition (10%) ** read revoke registry delta (10%) ** read attrib from ledger (10%) ** read payment balance from ledger (5%) * Write response time should be less that 5 seconds (would also like a report of the average). * Read response time should be less than 1 second (would also like a report of the average). * Unless view change in progress, pool should write 10 txns/sec and read 100 txns/sec  *Main cases for research:* 1) mixed set (imitation of active production work) - 1000 clients / 10 writes / 100 reads 2) payments only (understanding of pluggable ledgers productivity) - 1000 clients / as much as possible writes (1 - 4 - 10) / as much as possible reads (up to 10 - 40 - 100) 3) not payment transactions (comparision with historical productivity data) - 1000 clients / 10 writes / 100 reads  ></description> </Issue>

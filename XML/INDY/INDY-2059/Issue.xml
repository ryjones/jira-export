CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.7.0~dev896  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool of 7 nodes. 2. Demote random node. 3. Stop 2 nodes from remaining ones. 4. Start them back. 5. Promote demoted node back. 6. Try to send NYMs after some time (5+ minutes).  Actual Results: Pool with 5 nodes of 7 performs VC for very long time (10+ minutes) and actually finishes it but is it ok to do VC not under load with such small amount of nodes in pool?  Expected Resutls: TBD.  ></description> </Issue>

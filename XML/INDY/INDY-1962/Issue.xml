CDATA The default deployment of Indy should have liberal permissions so that developers do not have unnecessary hurdles to learning the system. No multi-signature should be required.  But Indy should include a sample transaction that configures the permissions in INDY-1729 in order demonstrate how multi-signature ledger permissions can be configured.  *TODO: Need to define* * A single trustee can setup a permission scheme * Once the permission scheme is established, it will define how many trustees are required to change the scheme (3 as the default in the sample transaction)  Â   Examples of rules requiring a multi-signature (that can be used by default in Indy deployments such as Sovrin): * Three trustees are required to ** create a new trustee ** remove a trustee * Two trustees are required to: ** create a steward ** revoke the role of a steward ** demote a steward's nodes ** can write an upgrade transaction to the ledger  ></description> </Issue>

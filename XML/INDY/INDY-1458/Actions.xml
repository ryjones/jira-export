CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.4.494 libindy/indy-cli 1.5.0 AWS acceptance pool with enabled recording.  *Steps to Validate:* 1. Perform regression of following cases: - Run acceptance for adding of a new node (/) - Run acceptance against cases with restart of nodes (/) - Run acceptance against cases with recovering from f+1 nodes (/) - Test catch-up (/) - Run load test with view changes (!)  *Actual Results:* Load test with view changes was verified on small pool (6-nodes). It will be verified on standard (25-nodes) pools in scope of confirmation testing of INDY-1453. The rest cases work normally.  ></body> </Action>

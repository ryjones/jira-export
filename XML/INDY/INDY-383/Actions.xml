CDATA The problem, Node4 and Node6 were turned off when they had ordered only 82 txns, while the others had ordered 83 txns, now when Node4 and Nod6 came back they could get not get n-f consistent ViewChangeDone message since n-f equals 5 in this case and we have only 4 Nodes giving consistent ViewChangeDone messages. An alternative approach can be that on startup, if n-f nodes are not able to satisfy a node(s), they trust the highest f+1 consistent ViewChangeDone messages This bug does not satisfy the protocol requirements since it increases the number of faults beyond `f` at a particular instant of time. A new task has been created to address this general problem, INDY-389  ></body> </Action>

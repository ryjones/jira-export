CDATA If a batch writes to multiple ledgers (it can be when plugins are installed; see for example https://sovrin.atlassian.net/browse/ST-623), then only the main ledger is BLS multi-signed. It means that - GET_TXN for the second ledger will not support BLS multi-signed audit proofs until the second ledger is multi-signed again.  - Get requests for the second ledger will not support BLS multi-signed state proofs until the second ledger is multi-signed again.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Changes made* * load script now accepts two additional parameters ** --taa_text - desired TAA text (default "test transaction author agreement text") ** --taa_version - desired TAA version (default "test_taa") * when starting load script checks whether taa_text is empty, and if it is not: ** it writes TAA AML transaction if it is not present in ledger ** it writes TAA transaction with given text and version if it is not present in ledger * if taa_text is empty ** it writes TAA transaction with given version and empty text if current TAA text is not empty ** if ledger already contains empty TAA text then load script doesn't care about version * during load TAA acceptance is attached to every transaction if it taa_text is not empty  *PR* https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1301  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Build Info: indy-perf-load 1.1.5  Steps to Validate: 1. Run production load test with default TAA settings (no new parameters are needed). 2. Run production load test with custom TAA settings.  Actual Results: TAA is set during both cases. TAA is added to requests.  Known Issues: We have ace condition on first custom TAA setting so we should rerun load script once with custom TAA parameters.  ></body> </Action>

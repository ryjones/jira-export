CDATA We have LGPL dependency because indy-anoncreds depends on charm-crypto.  Our next plans are to create a new CLI based on libindy, so that indy-anoncreds will be fully deprecated, and we can remove indy-anoncreds (and hence LGPL dependency).  So, in the scope of this task, we need to fix No license found and other issues.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Happy I've found this opened issue, as I've got an additional remark for  /indy-plenum/LICENSE|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/LICENSE  : it contains the "how to use" APPENDIX and the template boilerplate with bracket-fields.  Created PR # 485|https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/485  with a proposed update...  Apart from this, I'm not sure why indy-node is the only repo for which Github does not display the Apache-2.0 license badge and banner!?  See difference between those pages for instance:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/LICENSE    https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/LICENSE    https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE   Even weirder: our forks are showing the license badge/banner:   https://github.com/digital-me/indy-node/blob/master/LICENSE   Does anyone have the same issue or any idea?     REM: The md5sum is equivalent for all of them, and I've tried adding the LICENSE file in some other repo and it always "fix" the badge/banner.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA Added the latest results from the April 4, 2018 source code. The biggest call out here in addition to what is above is :  * There are some LGPL / LGPL-3.0 files in Indy, which should be reviewed and removed if possible.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA In IS-649, we added LICENSE files to most repos.  Remaining work: * Deciding on a policy for file headers * Migrating everything to be in compliance with that policy * Remove LGPL components, probably by deprecating the old CLI with the legacy anoncred implementation and old getting started guide * Double check everything  Prerequisites: * What is the Hyperledger about copyright/license headers in source files?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA First, we do not have a mandated header but let projects decide what and how they want to establish a practice for this.   We generally find copyright notices in headers fall out of date quickly. The contributor data is stored in git and determining "copyright" requires an analysis that becomes quite complex after the initial commit.   We DO NOT remove copyright notices that are already in a file unless they're removed by the copyright owner.   Most of our projects say something like, "Copyright Hyperledger and its contributors." and then include an SPDX short identifier for the license. For Apache 2, it would be a simple comment at the top of the file:    {{SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0}}  See  https://spdx.org/using-spdx  for more information on using SPDX short identifiers.     ></body> </Action>

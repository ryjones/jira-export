CDATA There are important and potentially dangerous actions in Indy which require a quorum of signers (Trustees, Stewards, etc.).  For example, as a trustee of an Indy Network, the network should require other trustees to sign administrative transactions I want to sponsor so that I am confident that no single trustee can abuse the network. All transactions that require a trustee role should require multiple trustee signatures. Specifically: * Add a trustee * Remove a trustee * Add a steward * Revoke the role of steward * Demote a consensus node * Send an upgrade transaction to the ledger  This feature can be applied not only for trustees and adopted for any role supported by the indy-node.  ></description> </Issue>

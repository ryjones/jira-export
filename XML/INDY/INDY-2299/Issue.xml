CDATA As INDY-2295 and other load tests showed, it's quite common that multiple view changes happen in a row because master needs to re-order old requests (with potentially non-zero latency getting bigger because of view change), but backups start ordering new requests with pretty low latency. So, the difference can easily get more than our limit (20 secs), and a new view change will be triggered.   *Acceptance criteria:* * Integration tests reproducing the issue * Do not start ordering on backups until ReOrdered is sent on master  ></description> </Issue>

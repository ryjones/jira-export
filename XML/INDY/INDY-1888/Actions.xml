CDATA Problem reason: - In first unmeasured time new replicas has throughput ratio 0, because start replica time was incorrect calculated.   Changes: - The bug with calculation replica start time in create_throughput_measurement is fixed.  PR: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1071  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1005   Version: * indy-node 1.6.714 -master * indy-plenum 1.6.619  -master  Risk factors: - In new instance start all replicas in this instance can be removed.  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: * test_instances_not_degraded_on_new_instance  Recommendations for QA: * Case1:  ** Start 6 nodes in Docker ** +Wait 5 min+ ** Start the 7th node ** Wait 5 min ** Check that no replica deleted. * Case2: ** Start 6 nodes in Docker ** +Wait 1 min+ ** Start the 7th node ** Wait 5 min ** Check that no replica deleted.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA 1. When we run `python3 perf_processes.py -c 10 -n 1 -g pool_transactions_genesis -t 1` actual average outgoing load is about 6 txns per second (according to load script "total" and pool metrics). 10 average txns per second is expected in this case since client machine resources is enough to provide this outgoing load and 25 nodes pool throughput is more than 6 writing txns per second (actually the first txns were sent with this output rate but then load script output rate degraded).  2. It looks like current load script is still waiting for pool responses before new requests will be sent since increased nodes' network latency reduces outgoing load. For example: `python3 perf_processes.py -c 25 -n 1 -g pool_transactions_genesis -t 1 -k "{\"nym\": 1, \"attrib\": 1, \"cred_def\": 1, \"schema\": 1}"` loads pool with:  ~10 average output rate txns/sec with close to 0 ms pool network latency ~ 8 average output rate txns/sec with 250..500 ms pool network latency ~ 4.5 average output rate txns/sec with 500..1000 ms pool network latency  The same output rate is expected in all this cases if load script just sends requests and doesn't wait for responses.  ></description> </Issue>

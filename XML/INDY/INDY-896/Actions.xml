CDATA This ticket is not about old CLI, but rather about implementation and validation of this on Ledger side. Let's decide whether this is a critical requirement (I think it's desirable, but not critical).  Once it's done on Ledger side (in the scope of current ticket), we can create a ticket for libindy CLI.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I think the most easy way to do that is to implement logic on sdk side: if sender did not set dest, than set dest to his identifier.  Why is it harder to implement on node side: * We could add dest field to txn right after checking signature (because adding new filed will breake signature), but in this case we will need to check signature again when pre-prepare propagated, and that will break the trick * We could add just some dynamic validation logic, but in this case txn will be written as is (without dest) anyway  If this must be done on node side, than we need to implement logic of applying right state (i.e. checking if dest present) and this need really deep analyse to be sure that we would not get problems with inequal hash state roots. For now i think we can postpone such a minor problem (and do not do such a serious changes).  ></body> </Action>

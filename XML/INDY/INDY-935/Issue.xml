CDATA As if now, Input Validation will not allow to have unknown (extra) fields in Node-to-Node messages (see node_messages.py). But sometimes we have to extend communication with new fields. The problem is that there can be Nodes in the pool which are still on old version, so they wil not understand this new messages.  As an option, we can just support having unknown extra fields at the end of a message, so the Nodes at least won't fail.   Also as of now all Node-to-Node messages are just lists, not dicts. So, it's hard to map new values to fields.    ></description> </Issue>

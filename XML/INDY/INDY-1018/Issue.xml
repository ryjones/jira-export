CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.2.50 (rc)  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install pool of 4 nodes. 2. Run load tests to fill ledger with ~9000 txns. 3. Add the 5th node. 4. Send NYM txn. 5. Add the 6th node. 6. Send NYM. 7. Get NYM.  Actual Results: Both nodes catches up successfully but NYM from Step 6 is not added (but GET_NYM command from Step 7 still works).  Expected Results: Pool should work normally after both nodes adding.  Workaround: Restart at least 4 nodes of 6 to return the pool to valid state.  Additional Info: The issue is not reproducing with small ledger pool.  ></description> </Issue>

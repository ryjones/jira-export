CDATA This may be an environment specific error, although this still needs attention.  The environment specific error was that I had a file  ~/.sovrin/pool/Alice/  with invites already associated, so when the script comes through, it sees a previous invitation (the faber invitation) and attempts to call ./sovrin_client/agent/walleted._mergeInvitation().  This is the normal logic when an invitation already exists.  This function '_mergeInvitation()' does not exist because of a typo. The function is '_mergeInvitaion' (notice the missing second 't').  No current tests test for this behavior, so its never thrown this error before.     ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Problem reason:* - There was a typo in the name of one of Wallet methods. The name was "_mergeInvitaion" instead of "_mergeInvitation". This method was referenced somewhere as "_mergeInvitaion", somewhere as "_mergeInvitation". - The proof request was missed in Acme invitation link from sovrin_client tests. - Printing of claim contents was broken. - The invitee's identifier was used in place of the inviter's one in the message about accepting an invitation.  *Changes:* - Corrected the name of Walleted._mergeInvitation method and references to it. - Fixed a bug with a missed proof request in Acme invitation link from sovrin_client tests. - Fixed broken printing of claim contents. - Corrected printing of proof requests. - Fixed a bug with a wrong identifier in the message about accepting an invitation.  *Committed into:*  indy-anoncreds: - commit hash: ad229c5d3370d61123617549acba5e507ad2340d - version: indy-anoncreds-dev 0.4.15  indy-node: - commit hash: ec0c600ebaadc009361276455dcdd78ff79c73d2 - version: indy-node-dev 0.4.33  *Risk factors:* - Nothing is expected.  *Risk:* - Low  ></body> </Action>

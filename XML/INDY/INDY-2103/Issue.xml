CDATA *Steps to Reproduce* * Create a multisignature transaction (for example: minting) * Sign it with the number of trustees required by the auth_rule for that transaction * Sign it with an additional invalid DID signature  *Observed Behavior* The error message returned is:  *Transaction has been rejected: client request invalid: InsufficientCorrectSignatures(3, 4)*  This is not specific enough. It doesn't help me understand that one of the signatures is invalid.  *Error message should say* Transaction has been rejected: client request is invalid. It requires X valid signatures and has Y valid signatures and Z invalid signatures. The invalid signatures are  list each invalid signature on a different line.   The totals of signatures should be displayed even if the values are zero. If there are no invalid signatures, exclude the lines listing the invalid signatures.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Currently all three indy core repos include very similar set of files for deb packages build. It is hard to maintain as it needs a lot of copy-paste operations. Also it is better to have a kind of base image for dockerfiles used by the process.  We need: * move common logic (scripts) into one place (it could be indy-node repo) * create base image for dockerfiles and publish it to docker hub * update debs build routine for all repos leaving only specific things * update groovy scripts used by jenkins CD jobs  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA If the pool is unable to reach consensus for a transaction how long will it be held in the queue?  Have a pool fall below consensus and send a transaction to the pool.  Bring the pool to the point it can reach consensus.  Does the transaction get written to the ledger?  If so how long will it stay in the queue before it is dropped?  Track the time between sending the transaction and when the pool is able to reach consensus and writes the transaction to the ledger.  ></description> </Issue>

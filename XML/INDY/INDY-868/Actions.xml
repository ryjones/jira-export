CDATA There are 3 things found: - if pool has lost consensus for 5 minutes or less: queued txn get written to the ledger by itself - if pool has lost consensus for ~6..7 minutes: queued txn get not written to the ledger by itself, but next txn sent to ledger forces queued txn to get written too (so both txns are written, but is this behaviour good enough for us?) - if pool has lost consensus for more than 8 minutes it doesn't return back to it by reaching n-f, so queued txn and all other txns sent later are not written to ledger (will be fixed in scope of INDY-849).  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've been working on a Java wrapper for libsovrin aka indy-sdk:  https://github.com/projectdanube/libsovrin-java   On a recent Sovrin Foundation call we agreed it would make sense to incorporate this into the rest of the Hyperledger INDY infrastructure.  What needs to be done? # Change license to Apache2. # Make sure all contributors have signed the Hyperledger CLA via CLAHub. # Change Java package names from com.danubetech.* to something else? # Decide whether it should be a separate repository as it is now, or whether it should be a subdirectory in the "indy-sdk" repository. # Move Github repository to Github "hyperledger" account and rename repository from "libsovrin-java" to "indy-sdk-java".  What else?  ></description> </Issue>

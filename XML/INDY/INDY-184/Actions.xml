CDATA I also don't have a strong opinion, I guess it comes down to code management, branching and versioning.  I think I'd have a slight preference for making it a separate repo. Other Hyperledger projects seem to do that too, e.g. "fabric-sdk-go" "fabric-sdk-py" "iroha-scala" "iroha-python" "iroha-android".  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="26420" issue="17661" author="peacekeeper" type="comment" body="We decided on today&apos;s Agent WG call to add the Java wrapper as a folder of indy-sdk rather than a separate repository. I will create a pull request for this, then I can become a committer on the project. This approach also &quot;forces&quot; us to keep the main library and the wrappers in sync." created="2017-06-15 16:01:24.0" updateauthor="peacekeeper" updated="2017-06-15 16:01:24.0"/>

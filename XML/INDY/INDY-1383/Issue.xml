CDATA Different investigations showed that while increasing view change timeouts did help, it seems that next problem is with catchup that goes on during view change.   View change should be simplifed: - catchup should not start at the view change start - no catchup should happen during view change for any reason - at the end of view change uncommited state should be cleared - catchup should start after the end of view change (it's still to be determined whether explicit start is needed, or nodes will be smart enough to start it themselves when needed)   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Problem reason*:  * we had no tad to filter out all resources created in scope of pool automation project, that made very hard to estimate costs (in future) * also there was no an API to set some additional tags (like Expiry, Owner, Purpose) that might be necessary in some cases  *Changes*:  * added general tag Project with default value Indy-PA to cover all resources where it is possible * set first letters capital for all used predefined tags * set lowercase for all resource names * added support for additional custom tags  *Committed into*:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1028   *Risk factors*:  Nothing is expected.   *Risk*:  Low    *Covered with tests*:  * tests for stateful_set.py module were extended  *Recommendations for QA*: * since QA for doesn't have ability to run aws related routine no validation from them are expected * was tested by me and  ~sergey.khoroshavin  using our accounts on AWS  ></body> </Action>

CDATA I've created simple ansible playbooks for test pool setup, configuration, log retrieval and cleanup: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/scripts/ansible They are primitive, but do their job of simple tasks automation (at least for me). Now in order to become more useful these playbooks should be improved in several ways (from most to least important in my opinion): - pool configuration options should be in separate file - playbooks should be refactored into a number of reusable roles and tasks - playbooks should be documented (especially after refactoring) - playbooks should be capable of installing indy node on clean system (now they assume that instances have multiple things configured) - test harness should be configured so further development of playbooks and roles can be done through TDD  ></description> </Issue>

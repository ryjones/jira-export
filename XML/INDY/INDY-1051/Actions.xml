CDATA Direct NYM txns adding in leveldb ledger was performed via `add_json_txns_to_ledger.py`:  | 5 minutes | 25k txns total added | 1st 25k part was added in 5 minutes | | 20 minutes | 50k txns total added | 2nd 25k was part was added in 15 minutes | | 45 minutes | 75k txns total added | 3rd 25k part was added in 25 minutes | | 1 hour 20 minutes | 100k txns total added | 4th 25k part was added in 35 minutes |  So we can see that direct adding json requests to ledger (without consensus reaching and network delays) degrades due to increasing amount of ledger txns.  ></body> </Action>

Check the 4th node after its upgrade time.  Actual Results: The 4th node upgrade doesn't start. Upgrade_log has wrong "cancelled" and "scheduled" entries (they are written with each node upgrade).  Expected Results: The whole pool should upgrade normally.  Workaround: Restart the 4th node manually to trigger scheduled upgrade.  ></description> </Issue>

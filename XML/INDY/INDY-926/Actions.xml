CDATA  ~ashcherbakov   Unfortunately, I don't know how to answer this question. I do not see a document called "Common Setup Instructions" within indy-node. I also no longer see  the "setup.md" document in indy-node. Because this is what the ticket is referencing, this is exactly what I'm looking for.   Now, if this was done, but one document stripped or combined with the other or even if the document changed titles? That I do not know. I also do not know if "everything is fine here" because I have no way of knowing what is correct or not. If the document changed title and was moved, added, is the content correct? Only a subject matter expert would know that.  I have to assume "yes" BUT I cannot definitively say that because I'm not finding the documents referenced in the ticket by their names as referenced in the ticket.  ~SeanBohan_Sovrin  ?  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~TechWritingWhiz  There are no more setup.md or "Common Setup Instructions" docs. There is just one doc now:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/setup-dev.md,  and it contains all required information.  So, I believe we can close this ticket as Invalid.  ></body> </Action>

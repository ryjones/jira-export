CDATA I found this by adding 9 new nodes to a pool of 10. Basically you cannot add more than f new nodes to a pool at a time.   The reason is because currently as soon as a new node transaction has occurred the pool counts that node toward consensus.  When a node is catching up it is counted as a failed node and cannot participate in consensus.   For example: You have a pool of 10 nodes so your f value is 3. If you add 4 new nodes that are  all trying to catch up you are below the allowed f value so the pool cannot reach consensus.  -- The likelihood of this happening is low, but I am marking the issue as a high since it can bring down the pool. The only way out since you cannot come to consensus to demote a node is to copy the transaction files to enough nodes that brings them in sync so consensus can be reached.   ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * _inventory_init.py_ script should prepare group vars file where number of node and client instances are separately configurable * _pool_create.yml_ playbook should provision both node and client instance according to inventory group vars * _pool_install.yml_ playbook should configure both node and client instances according to inventory group vars * client instances should have load script installed as well as pool genesis transaction pointing at nodes * _pool_destroy.yml_ playbook should destroy both node and client instances * _pool_*.yml_ playbooks probably should be renamed to better reflect that they manage not only nodes, but clients also (probably just _create.yml_, _configure.yml_, _destroy.yml_)  ></description> </Issue>

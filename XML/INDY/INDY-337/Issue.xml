CDATA Currently all migration scripts are applied in alphabetical order that satisfy the condition: (script's first version >= a version we're migrating from) and (script's second version <= a version we're migrating to).  This behavior needs to be enhanced. A shortest possible list of migration should be calculated and applied.  Example: * We migrate from 1 to 10 * We have migrations 1_to_2, 2_to_4, 1_to_6, _8___to__9. Only 1_to_6 and 8_to_9 should be applied.  This task still requires some thinking on how to handle situations like this: * We migrate from 1 to 10 * We have migrations 1_to_2, 2_to_4, 6_to_8, 1_to_7, 5_to_9  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA _Environment_: BuilderNet FoundationBuilder Node is running Sovrin version 1.1.50 (indy-node v1.9.0) . This issue is occurring on several nodes, and on different Networks also. I noticed a similar issue in the SovrinNode logs on the StagingNet (logs can be included for that Node also, if needed)     _Steps to Reproduce_:   The use case where this is occurring is on the Sovrin Networks.  These networks have nodes that are added to and removed from them pretty regularly. The Buildernet, for example, has been fairly consistent where nodes are usually added to it and not removed, but there have been 2 cases on the BuilderNet where a node was moved to the MainNet and removed from the BuilderNet.  It is also quite normal forthere to be errors while getting a Node added to the BuilderNet where we will need to change the Nodes Ports/Keys/IP addresses and other things while trying to get them up and running in consensus.  There have also been cases where the Steward Keys have to be replaced so the node will need brought in under the new Steward NYM.     _Expected Behavior_: Issue seems like it should be fixed rather than continuing to report that it is still a problem in the log file.     _Observed Behavior_: Issue is reported at least 4 times per minute in the log file.  There is probably a root cause of an underlying issue needing resolved.   _Notes_:  ></description> </Issue>

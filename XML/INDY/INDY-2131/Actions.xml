CDATA Problem reason: * INDY-2057 introduced new possibilities of system tests running made that much more simple and configurable, more tests become ready to add to CD pipeline. Need to updated CD pipeline.  Changes: * updated system tests running logic in CD pipeline * made some hardening of system tests  PR: * https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation/pull/25 *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation/pull/26  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1342   Version: - Indy Node 1.9.0.dev1005  Risk factors: - That impacts rc and stable CD pipeline as well.  Risk: - Low  Covered with tests: - no, tested manually  Recommendations for QA * ensure that tests are run within a proper environment and with proper settings and are passed: check recent pipelines where new logic is presented, e.g.Â  https://build.sovrin.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/indy-node%2Findy-node-cd/detail/master/1005/pipeline/274/   ></body> </Action>

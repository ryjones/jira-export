CDATA Failed tests block release of indy-node so this ticket has the highest priority.  The main problem now is risen SDK timeouts. Thus our tests mainly terminated by Jenkins supervisor as its timeouts lower than SDK's. This leads to enormous time execution of tests, that's why fixing and rerun of tests takes much time. Moreover, termination of Jenkins pipeline by timeout leaves us without tests artifacts, so it forces us to look for the tests execution machine and get logs manually, that also inhibits the fixing process.  ></body> </Action>

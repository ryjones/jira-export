CDATA We probably need to show the Sovrin Version on OS Banner(one that is shown when you ssh into validator) just like Ubuntu shows, to quickly make it clear what version of Sovrin is installed and running at the moment. The only way to know this at the moment is by running this command: {{apt-get -s install sovrin}}  We also need some command (bash / python script) that gives a quick status of the validator Like: Validator running time for this many hours, All Ledgers and there synced up Status, Upcoming Upgrade schedule etc.  This will make the life of stewards easy, they do not need to know the internals of using sovrin cli or even having one for knowing such trivial status.  ></description> </Issue>

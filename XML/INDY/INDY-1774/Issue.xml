CDATA We can see that memory is slightly increasing during a load that pool can handle. We suspect that there can be a limit where it's cut off, but in order to prove it we need to run a long test.  Increasing memory consumption may be caused by RocksDB (see comments in INDY-1724).  *Acceptance Criteria:* * Run load script with 1-10 NYMs per second for 2-3 days. * Check graphs for memory consumption  Â   ></description> </Issue>

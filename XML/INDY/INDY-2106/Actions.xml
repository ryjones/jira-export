CDATA After analizing logs from ev1 was noticed, that: 1. Upgrade procedure was not produced simultaneously. On ev1 node upgrade was completed at 16:45:25, but some PREPREPAREs was received at 16:46:29 with old \{viewNo: 3}. It means, that some of the nodes didn't start upgrade. 2. Catchup of ledger 3 (audit ledger) wasn't completed for ev1 node, because quorum of LEDGER_STATUS wasn't achived by reason, described in previous point. At that time many of nodes doesn't have an audit ledger. 3. After POOL_RESTART cmd audit ledger completed a cathup procedure and zero view change was finished successfully.  Resume: * problem is not critical, because this upgrade follows audit ledger adding (it's very big change) and it was not simultaneous. * INDY-2112 was created for preventing this situation in future.   ~mgbailey , can you please check, that all of nodes have synchronized time? Because for now, it looks like force-upgrade doesn't work as we expect.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~mgbailey  As it was a one-time issue (due to a tricky additional of a fundamental ledger and not 100% simultaneous update), I think we can close this ticket.  ></body> </Action>

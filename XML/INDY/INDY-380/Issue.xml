CDATA There is the runner.py script which is common for 4 repos. The script is used for testing on CI and local testing. So we have two options: * store 4 copies of the script in each repo * store the script in a common repo so each developer has to somehow obtain the script from the repo  Both options have disadvantages.  The only solution can be do not use runner.py by making the tests working using just the `pytest` commands.   A solution should be check on the CI and the developer environment (pycharm and terminal).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.588  *Steps to Validate:* 1. Set up the pool of 25 nodes. 2. Run load with 70 writing txns and 750 reading txns/sec.  *Actual Results:* Whole pool was restarted with OOM after 12K txns written.  *Expected Results:* Need to figure out what was changed since 1.5.543 version because on this version we were able to write up to 112K txns.  *Logs and metrics:*  s3://qanodelogs/indy-1670/NodeXX/ To get logs, run following command on log processor machine:  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://qanodelogs/indy-1670/ /home/ev/logs/indy-1670/  ></description> </Issue>

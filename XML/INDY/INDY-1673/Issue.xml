However, when we send the same request the second time, ledger will send the response from transaction log only from domain ledger, disregarding the plugged one. It can be solved with the call to the PRE_SEND_REPLY hook." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-09-03 11:45:41.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:18.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:18.0" votes="0" watches="3" workflowId="44729"/>

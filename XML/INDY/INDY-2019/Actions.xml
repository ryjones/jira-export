CDATA Problem reason: * INDY-1992 brought new release and versioning logic for indy-plenum and indy-node but didn't activate it. Also jeknins shared library wasn't fully tested  Changes:  * created new shared library release 2.0.1 * tested, fixed and activated new logic for plenum & node  PR: *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1125  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1219  *  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1223  *  https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/jenkins-shared/pull/6  * https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/jenkins-shared/pull/7   Version: * plenum: 1.7.0.dev740 * node: 1.7.0.dev878 * jenkins library: 2.0.1  Risk factors: * new versioning logic impacts upgrade/restart logic * new release scheme is quite different from legacy one and required big changes in jenkins library  Risk: * High  Covered with tests: * unit/integration tests provided for both node and plenum * jeknins shared library was tested maually since there is no framework to automate that yet  Recommendations for QA: * perform deep testing for upgrade/restart * for upgrade txns use the version of the package in PyPI (e.g. 1.7.0.dev878, 1.7.0.rc2, 1.7.0)  ></body> </Action>

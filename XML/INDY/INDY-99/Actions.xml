CDATA Test was added:  https://github.com/evernym/plenum/commit/d68c7ee21a4ac339c84a8d61169719788919f9a5   Seems it didn't work from the beginning cause code for expected exception wasn't enabled ( https://github.com/evernym/plenum/commit/d68c7ee21a4ac339c84a8d61169719788919f9a5#diff-f736d5294c674ac0820ea80f613523d5R258)   Test was disabled:  https://github.com/evernym/plenum/commit/863020c7d14bf123297b0b7a2a269ba096d1d1a8   For now we have already have test which treat case of changing HA for running node as valid:  https://github.com/evernym/plenum/blob/master/plenum/test/script/test_change_primary_node_ha.py#L17   Thus, testStopScriptIfNodeIsRunning seems as obsolete and incorrect and should be removed.  ></body> </Action>

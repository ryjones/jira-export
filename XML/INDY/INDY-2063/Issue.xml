CDATA As of now, we have AUTH_RULE txn that can set/modify one AUTH_RULE.  However, there are cases (such as initial bootstrap), when we need to set multiple (or even all) auth rules.  In order to simplify and improve usability, especially in the case of multi-signature, we need to have a command to set multiple auth rules.  Option: # Modify existing AUTH_RULE command so that it supports a list of rules to be set ** Pros: *** Easier and more consistent # Creates a new AUTH_RULES command to set multiple rules ** Pros *** More granular in terms of auth rule permissions for AUTH_RULE/AUTH_RULES, so that we may potentially have different policies on who can change each rule.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Node that was demoted by NODE transaction should not process client's requests.  For now, after demotion node will receive client's requests and try to send PROPAGATE message to the rest of nodes. It's not critical, because it doesn't affect them. But in general, other nodes will log all of the WARNINGs like "receive message from unknown node". Of course, we can't guarantee that demoted malicious node will not send PROPOGATE. But for "normal" node it can be helpful.  ></description> </Issue>

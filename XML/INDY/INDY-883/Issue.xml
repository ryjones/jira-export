CDATA In order to use BLS multi-sigs and state proofs, a node needs to generate BLS keys and send NODE txn with BLS key specified.  We have the following options on how live pool can have BLS signatures supported. 1. Manual - each Steward runs 'init_bls_keys' script - each Steward send NODE txn with BLS key specified there  2. Semi-automated 1 - each Steward runs 'init_bls_keys' script - we gather public BLS keys from each Steward, and edit genesis txn file and current ledgers in migration script.  3. Semi-automated 2 - we provide a script for each Steward (which needs to be executed manually) which does the following: -- runs 'init_bls_keys' -- send NODE txn with BLS keys   ></description> </Issue>

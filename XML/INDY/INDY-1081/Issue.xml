CDATA Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup pool of 5 node. 2. Send NYM transaction to check that pool works. 3. Stop indy-node on node 1. 4. Send NYM transaction to check that pool still works. 5. Stop indy-node on node 2. 6. Send NYM transaction to check that there is no consensus. 7. Stop indy-node on node 3, send NYM transaction to check that there is no consensus. 8. One by one start services on nodes 1 - 3 (order doesn't matter), send NYM transaction after each node connection. => indy-node is running on each node, but transactions are not written. 9. Restart indy-node on each node and send NYM transaction.  Actual Results: Pool can reach consensus only after restarting of all nodes.  Expected Results: Pool should reach consensus when n-f nodes are working.  Additional Information: After stopping of 2 nodes instead of 3, all works correctly. It doesn't matter, which nodes are stopped. In case of stopping nodes 3 - 5, behavior is the same.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA * GET_VALIDATOR_INFO execution may be quite long (6 sec) and it's done synchronously blocking main execution. * It affects connections, so Nodes started to disconnect from each other after such long delays. * The main reason of long execution GET_VALIDATOR_INFOÂ  is memory profiling. * This can lead to system tests failing where GET_VALIDATOR_INFO is used a lot (see INDY-2171)  *Suggested fix:* * Remove memory profiling from GET_VALIDATOR_INFO execution * Do not change output JSON structure, just put N/A into memory-related fields.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA As discussed with  ~lovesh , plenum/sovrin settings were combined with stp settings while this ticket was being in progress. That was done in the following commit: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/commit/f1b737136632862df8ea87b6aa5f706ea5d67675 So stp settings must be added to *Configuration Settings* document.  Re-opened the ticket to add stp settings to *Configuration Settings* document.  ></body> </Action>

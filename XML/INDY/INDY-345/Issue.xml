CDATA *Description* The sovrin_config.py file is used to override configuration settings like setting the log level.  The task is to identify all possible configuration changes and their valid inputs. Once done do not document in this ticket.  Send all information to Kelly or put your findings into the document ".Override Configuration Settings" in Kelly's shared google document in the "Testing/How To" location. Once this task is complete Kelly will get the information to the tech writer forÂ official documentation.  *Findings* Created a document *Configuration Settings* describing purposes and formats of all the stp/plenum/sovrin configuration settings. It is located in the shared folder *Development -> Testing -> How To*.

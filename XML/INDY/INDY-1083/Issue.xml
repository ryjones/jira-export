CDATA We should have an assumption to be able to have just one CLAIM_DEF (that is a key) for an ISSUER_DID. If one needs to rotate a key, a new DID must be used. It means that ISSUER_DID is rather a CLAIM_DEF's DID (or key's DID). So, we must check if there is already a CLAIM_DEF for a Schema-DID pair, and not allow to override it on ledger. We now do the same for Schema (that is we can not override Schema with the existent name-version-origin triple).  Tasks: 1) do not allow to override CLAIM_DEF on ledger for already existent schem-did pair; 2) update docs and diagrams so that it's clear it's not possible to create multiple CLAIM_DEFS for the same schema-did pair.   ></description> </Issue>

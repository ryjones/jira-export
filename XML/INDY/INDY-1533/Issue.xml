CDATA When nscapture is used to capture a node state archive, the archive contains sufficient information to reproduce a replay environment using the same python, pip module, and apt package versions.  Rather than leaving it up to a developer to create a VM/container manually in which to replay a recording, enhance nsreplay to provide an option to instantiate and replay a node inside a docker container. nsreplay would use the contents of the config and capture directories in the node state archive to produce an equivalent node execution environment inside a docker container.  ></description> </Issue>

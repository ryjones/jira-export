CDATA The concern is that the results from validator-info provide details on local hardware and node characteristics that could be used by an attacker:  {code} {"HDD_all":"51280 Mbs","RAM_used_by_node":"500 Mbs","HDD_used_by_node":"51280 MBs","RAM_all_free":"751 Mbs"}  {code}  The right approach depends on the use case: * When validator-info.py is called from a local machine, it should provide the requested information for the local machine without needing Steward Credentials (we don't want the Steward keys to be on the local machine). Local users already have the information contained in the result. This is also necessary for automated processes. * When this API is called remotely (see IS-588) then it should required Steward or Trustee credentials.  ></body> </Action>

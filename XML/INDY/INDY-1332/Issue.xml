CDATA Now indy-plenum's and indy-node's listener sockets are always bound on 0.0.0.0, it is hard-coded, so that we listen all interfaces. We need to bind listener sockets on addressesÂ specified for node stack and client stack for complete support of separate NICs. Also we need to be able to set different max queue sizes for node-to-node and client-to-node communications.  ></description> </Issue>

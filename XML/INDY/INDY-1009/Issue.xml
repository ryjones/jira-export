CDATA A developer who encounters Indy should find the Getting Started Guide prominently linked from the readme.md in the repo of all indy-* repos, as well as on any wikis for the repos. All these links should point to the same place.  Links that are the master branch of the code should point to the version of the Guide that's on either master or stable, but never to any other branches. Links on the stable branch should always point to the Guide on the stable branch, never to master.  All old/stale versions of the Guide (in Google Docs, in PDFs on sovrin.org, in github.com/hyperledger/archive) should be marked as deprecated and/or updated to point to more recent content, or deleted/hidden so people can't be confused.  Testing of the Getting Started Guide should evaluate all branches of the flow described in the Guide (e.g., both Docker and Vagrant), and should begin by browsing to the github repo and following a link from the readme.md, to guarantee that QA folks are experiencing the guide the same way a developer would find it. Specifically, the QA workflow should not begin by browsing to a bookmarked URL that might be different from the one external developers would find on their own.  If a particular variant of the Guide isn't working (e.g., Docker doesn't work), the Guide should not be considered functional until the bug is fixed or the variant of the workflow is removed from the Guide.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA i am unable to run the load tests using the add_keys.py and load_test.py scripts. The add_keys.py script shows in the output that is is using cryptonyms and we have switched to DIDs  *See attachment*  In order to perform operations the NYM that is added must have an associated verkey.  In addition to run the "send ATTRIB" command you have to add a NYM without a verkey to also send ATTRIBs for that NYM. If you add a NYM with a verkey then only the owner of that NYM can add an ATTRIB to it. So the option for send ATTRIB in the load_test.py script needs to account for that.   ></description> </Issue>

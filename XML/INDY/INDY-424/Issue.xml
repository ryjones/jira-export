CDATA Build Info: sovrin 0.2.8  Overview: Command doesn't perform after it is scheduled.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Send valid POOL_UPGRADE command, e.g.: send POOL_UPGRADE name=upgrade0 version=0.2.9 sha256=e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 action=start schedule={'Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv': '2 017-07-14T12:00:00.258870+00:00', '8ECVSk179mjsjKRLWiQtssMLgp6EPhWXtaYyStWPSGAb': '2017-07-14T12:05:00.258870+00:00', 'DKVxG2fXXTU8yT5N7hGEbXB3dfdAnYv1JczDUHpmDxya':'2017-07-14T12:10:00.258870+00:00', '4P S3EDQ3dW1tci1Bp6543CfuuebjFrg36kLAUcskGfaA':'2017-07-14T12:15:00.258870+00:00'} timeout=10 force=False 2. Get success message "Pool upgrade successful".  Actual Results: Upgrade doesn't perform at scheduled time. There is no entries about attempts of upgrade neither in NodeX.log nor in Node journalctl.  Expected Results: Upgrade should perform at scheduled time.  Additional Info: Pool has a normal state (I can send and get NYMs due to this case execution). Value of force parameter doesn't matters (it is unsuccessful both with True or False).  ></description> </Issue>

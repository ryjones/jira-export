CDATA As a result of INDY-1730 we have a rules that define absolute quorums for administrative actions. In scope of this ticket we have to implement a strategy of combination of absolute numbers and percentage to implement a rules like "33% of trustees but not less than 2", but using of percentage requires INDY-1594 complete.  *Notes* * It is expected that requiring a percentage of users will be implemented after the capability of requiring a specific threshold of signatures and recording the rules on the config ledger is already implemented. * We do not yet have an efficient mechanism for getting from the ledger the total number of potential signers with a specific role. That will have to be done as part of this work.  ></description> </Issue>

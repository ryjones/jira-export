CDATA The response on GET_AUTH_RULES request contains fields txnTime and seqNo. And they both are equal to null in any case. If some auth rules already updated by the network administrator it seems confusing as the state really updated and it's expected to see the seq no and update time from the latest transaction  Steps to reproduce:  1) write some custom auth rules to the ledger 2) perform get auth rules request (e.g. without parameters)  Observed behavior: txnTime and seqNo are nulls  Expected behavior: txnTime and seqNo from latest update transaction or completely skipped as not applicableÂ   ></description> </Issue>

PoA  Need to add logic for starting view change procedure without quorum of InstanceChange messages but by quorum of ViewChange msgs. The main reason is that by some reason we may not to receive the needed count of IC but rest of pool may already start View Change procedure. In that case, node will be out of ordering and will be waiting for catchup by checkpoints (2 unstable checkpoints for 100 batches each). h2. Steps to implementation # Need to define quorum of ViewChange messages for forced VC procedure starting. There are 2 options here: Option 1. We can use the same quorum as for ViewChange (n - f) in normal way and don't change NewView message validation. But there is a case, when node don't receive enough count of ViewChange and it will pass this VC either. Option 2. We can use for this situation quorum F + 1, but take into account that NewView validation process should be changed too.              Option 1 takes less time for implementation, but in some cases cannot solve the problem.            2. After receiving quorum of ViewChange messages, view change process can be continued in a normal way (if proposed view no more than current).            3. Need to write integration and simulation tests and make sure that all of current tests are passed.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA *Problem* * A node may not receive a quorum of InstanceChanges for some reasons, but the rest of the pool may start a View Change. * Currently the node will have to wait until the quorum of checkpoints from other nodes is received, and do a catchup. Until this is will not be able to order. * Old view change logic contained to start a view change on a quorum of ViewChangeDone messages (`_next_view_indications `). We need to so something similar with a new view change protocol.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Start a view change on a quorum (F+1?) of ViewChange messages from other nodes * Add tests  ></description> </Issue>

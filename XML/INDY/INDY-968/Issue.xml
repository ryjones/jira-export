CDATA The pool state is updated after new txn writing now (it was identified after the discussion about node BLS keys rotation) so there are some cases when we are unable to get NYM using BLS signatures:  - we change node BLS and no txns were written to ledger after that - pool state is not updated - we can verify txns signed with old keys by reaching consensus f+1 (old way) *but not using BLS* - we change node BLS, no txns were written to ledger after that and we have *only one node online (with just rotated BLS)* - pool state is not updated - we cannot verify txns signed with old keys because the single node has new BLS and we cannot reach f+1  So we need to update the pool's signature of state straight after any node BLS key changing.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Issue (see INDY-2274)* * System tests doing restart fail intermittently * Some nodes can not join the pool if they restart during the load   Zstack tries to do handle reconnections manually by using ping/pongs and reconnecting sockets. It looks like that may lead to issues. Moreover, it looks like ZMQ is able to handle reconnection by it own.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Prove that the current logic is really needed, or prove that we can live without it * If latter then ** Get rid of ping/pongs ** Assume that we connected to a Node once we receive any message from it ** Still use monitor socket to detect disconnections (it's needed to initiate view change when Primary is disconnected)   ></description> </Issue>

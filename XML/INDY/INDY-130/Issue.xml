CDATA Anytime a node falls behind and performs a catch up on the transactions a new line (blank) is entered in the transactions file. The new line causes the line count to be different than the other nodes. This should not cause a problem, but should not be present either.  *Steps* # You need a 4 node setup.  # Shutdown one of the nodes. # Send some transactions. # Restart the node that is down.  # When that node starts up it will do a catch up. # After the catch up you can do a line count on the transaction file on each node and see there is a line count differnce.  # When you check the transactions file on the node that did the catch up you should find a blank line in the transactions file.  The transactions file is located in ".sovrin/data/nodes/<node name>/transactions_sandbox" and the file is named "1" or "1001" depending on how many transactions you have.  ></description> </Issue>

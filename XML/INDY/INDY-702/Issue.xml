CDATA A single cli client should be able to connect to one of various sovrin networks, each with its own pool_transactions file.  For example, a user will want to connect to either the live (provisional) network, the STN, the ESN, or a local test pool.  Each will have its own genesis file, e.g. pool_transactions_live, pool_transactions_STN, pool_transactions_ESN, pool_transactions_localTest, etc., which are all in the .sovrin directory.  The user should be able to select which network to connect to, corresponding to which genesis file to use, by typing the suffix of the genesis file on the connection line, in this fashion:  sovrin> connect live  or  sovrin> connect STN  etc.  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA I checked that using mentioned rc packages: it was caused by passing verkey as string to zmq API where bytestring is expected.  It was fixed by that commit:  https://github.com/evernym/plenum/commit/ea1c39118b3720bb6efb0dc9467554776577bf96#diff-9c07832b246cbe747816eeedc2dec46cL166  and doesn't appear in master for now.     ></body> </Action>
<Action id="26780" issue="17619" author="danielhardman" type="comment" body="Line 179 of stack_manager.py still contains the overly broad &quot;except&quot; clause:  https://github.com/evernym/plenum/blob/master/plenum/common/stack_manager.py#L179.  This pattern of catching all exceptions without understanding their semantics is usually a code smell. Please change it so that we are catching just the error(s) that we understand, by specific type, instead of catching a generic Exception. (Or, if catching a generic Exception is truly correct because, no matter what goes wrong, we know we want to catch it in this place, please add a comment justifying that decision.)

CDATA  ~danielhardman  I've removed that exceptions suppression which could happen in intiRemoteKeys during updating keys for one of the node in the pool. Test has been provided. (https://github.com/evernym/plenum/pull/225)  As we discussed with  ~ashcherbakov  exception here means that we likely failed to update cert files, so the node won't be able to communicate with the other node which keys have been updated.  It's not the only place where something could go wrong. I mean both cases: suppressed generic exceptions and lack of try-catch blocks that cover all possible cases of failure.  For now it seems we don't have general approach to handle exceptions "on the top level". I think it's an important issue out of that task's scope.   ></body> </Action>

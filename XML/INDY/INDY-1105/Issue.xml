CDATA New node affects pool's F value right after node transaction written. As a result we cannot add several nodes during a small period of time. Also in case of stepping though the border values where F value should be changed (from 6 nodes to 7, from 9 to 10, etc.) we require higher consensus value. It would be better to recalculate F values only after new node finished catchup and started to participate. There are at least two options 1 - new NODE transaction, something like NODE_PARTICIPATING 2 - recheck node status  ></description> </Issue>

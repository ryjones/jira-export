CDATA Like idea of working on synch status before it participate in consensus.Â    ~ashcherbakov  - how is this different than an observer node state? There should be a new state in the pool state that is a staging area for new nodes. Pls advise.  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="39348" issue="27124" author="ashcherbakov" type="comment" body="it&apos;s not about Observers, this is a general issue that nodes re-calculate n and f once a new node is connected. Bute the newly connected node may not yet finished catching up, so it is not yet a full member of the pool. So, we need to re-calculate n and f for new nodes only after they finish initial catch-up." created="2018-01-30 08:14:34.0" updateauthor="ashcherbakov" updated="2018-01-30 08:14:34.0"/>

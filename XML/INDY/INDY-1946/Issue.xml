CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * viewNo and ppSeqNo should be included into transactions in audit ledger * current viewNo and ppSeqNo should be restored from audit ledger  *Additional notes* * This is based on design described in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/design/catchup-and-audit-proposal.md * It might be safer to implement this after INDY-1945, but probably they can be done in parallel  ></description> </Issue>

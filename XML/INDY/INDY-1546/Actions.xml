CDATA After several experiments with writing/reading revoc_reg_def and revoc_reg_entry transactions was noticed, that (with enabled metrics): * dynamic validation for revocation transactions is spent about 15 ms vs 5 ms for other transactions. In that case, ordering process will reducing and all input queues will be overloaded. * internal memory usage for python's objects, like 'str', 'list' take up ~ 1/4 of all node's memory usage.Â   Therefore, our main assumtion is that there is no memory leaks. Revocation transactions is a "heavy" transactions from validation's and memory usage side.  ></body> </Action>

If there is a heavy load for a long time, a lot of messages are stashed in transport queues, and it may lead to high memory consumption." created="2018-08-09 09:08:07.0" updateauthor="ashcherbakov" updated="2018-08-09 09:08:07.0"/>

CDATA Create a simple binary tool that we can put on an Ubuntu VM that will tell us if zmq traffic is being allowed to pass to a destination. More specifically, this would be for an administrator who is making a new agent or diagnosing an existing one, to be able to tell if a firewall is preventing contact with Validators due to deep-packet-inspection (DPI) blocking ZMQ traffic. By having control of both sides of the connection, we can pair the tool with other network diagnostic techniques to identify the source of connection errors.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Command line tool exists that can be run to test that ZMQ traffic can be passed. * The tool is run on both sides of a connection (a machine on the client network, and the support representative's machine). * Network traffic generated by the tool mimics Indy Node traffic in order to diagnose behavior of DPI firewalls. * Command line tool runs in Ubuntu 18.04. * Installation and execution should be as simple as possible, ideally just copying the binary over and executing it from the command line. (No dependencies would be ideal.)  *Notes* * It would be undesirable to have this baked into the indy-node library, since the diagnostic will be of use to agents as well as to new validators.  ></description> </Issue>

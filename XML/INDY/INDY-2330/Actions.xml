According to acceptance criteria we should create a tool which can provide client and server functionality as well. Also, for diagnostic purposes it should check tcp and zmq functionality. h2. Client.  As a client it should be able to create connection through tcp and zmq sockets and send/receive diagnostic message which emulates Node traffic. h2. Server.  As server we propose to use current ZStack implementation and add a simple tcp check. Current ZStack will be copied (it's enough independent) as is and combined with client's part.  ></body> </Action>

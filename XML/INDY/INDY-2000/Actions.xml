CDATA *Problem 1:* * Node21, Node25 - can't start ordering after view change 1 -> 2 * Node3, Node13 - can't start ordering after view change 2 -> 3  Nodes can't process stashed messages because the first PrePrepare discards with  {code:java} message has incorrect state trie root; suspicion code is 21 {code} It should be fixed after implementation of audit ledger.  But in fact, nodes make catchup one by one and don't clean the requests queue. It leads to out of memory error.  And I think it should be explored.  *Problem 2:*  Node11, Node18 stopped with ZMQ error {code:java} zmq.error.ZMQError: Address already in use {code} when count of client connections were about 460 (459, 461). Nodes stopped and didn't restart.  ></body> </Action>

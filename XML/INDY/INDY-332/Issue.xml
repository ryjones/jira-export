CDATA sovrin-node 0.3.24,   AWS,  Ubuntu 16.04  ></environment> <description><! CDATA While testing for INDY-331, the load generator client script ended prematurely.  In the output from that script, we noticed many lines repeating:    {noformat} 2017-06-24 14:25:58,612 | INFO | client.py (280) | handleOneNodeMsg | Client Cr7ph7RQ9zEwyx5hzxBMrh6quMc3UteoSNz3pawR9v3c got msg from node asobiC: {'reqId': 1498312057549903, 'identifier': 'EK6VWvsoNSVwD3SaVGw68N5sA7aRbepTAwRcNMKQXdYc', 'op': 'REQACK'} 2017-06-24 14:25:58,612 | INFO | client.py (280) | handleOneNodeMsg | Client Cr7ph7RQ9zEwyx5hzxBMrh6quMc3UteoSNz3pawR9v3c got msg from node asobiC: {'reqId': 1498312057549903, 'identifier': 'EK6VWvsoNSVwD3SaVGw68N5sA7aRbepTAwRcNMKQXdYc', 'op': 'REQACK'} 2017-06-24 14:25:58,612 | INFO | client.py (280) | handleOneNodeMsg | Client Cr7ph7RQ9zEwyx5hzxBMrh6quMc3UteoSNz3pawR9v3c got msg from node asobiC: {'reqId': 1498312057549903, 'identifier': 'EK6VWvsoNSVwD3SaVGw68N5sA7aRbepTAwRcNMKQXdYc', 'op': 'REQACK'} {noformat} Eventually, the load generator failed.  Going to the logs on the 'asobi' node, we see a matching pattern of repeated log messages (file attached).  We are unable to go back to the beginning of this behavior in the asobi logs, since the logs rapidly filled up and rolled.  The issue to be examined is more with the validator node than with the load generator, which was not running a heavy load (1 transaction each 15 seconds ).  The validator had the following behavior: # Excessive repeated messages,  # A gap of more than a day with no logging after the last repeated message # Many fewer entries (1000+) in transactions_sandbox than in other validators     ></description> </Issue>

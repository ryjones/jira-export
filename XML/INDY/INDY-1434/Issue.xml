At least 10 of them (parameterized schema_invalid_test.py with 2 test cases against 5 parameters each) can be rewritten from scratch based on schema_json with various parameters returned from anoncreds module. Also new tests can be added instead of skipped ones due to removed / completely reworked SDK methods." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2018-06-28 08:50:51.0" updated="2019-11-01 13:04:47.0" resolutiondate="2019-11-01 13:04:47.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="31453"/>

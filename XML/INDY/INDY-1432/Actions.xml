CDATA *Changes reason:* Load script should be able to send requests to pool and config ledgers in order to test such transactions along with domain requests.  *Changes:* - Added pool ledger transaction type - Added config ledger transaction type  *PR:* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1006  *Version:* - master  *Risk factors:* - Didn't test both requests type together or along with other transactions.  *Risk:* - Medium  *Recommendations for QA:* Run load script with: 1. -k config_writes  2. -k pool_writes parameters; 3. check with both kinds simultaneously; 4. check both types with nym or any other domain transactions.  ></body> </Action>

CDATA The changes I'm talking about will be done in indy-plenum, indy-node and sovrin repositories. For the moment I'm preparing build to test these changes and after testing the changes will be included into RC. So probably the user documentation for that RC should contain proper description of indy-node starting procedure.  I have not checked all the user documentation we have and for now I can think of documents like this   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUrvt8rEekZmpfHjoeod7ZmWh3ISvSf-18vK5yTH6RY/edit#|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUrvt8rEekZmpfHjoeod7ZmWh3ISvSf-18vK5yTH6RY/edit      Probably we should ask QA team to help  ></body> </Action>

CDATA  ~dsurnin  Ok, so all of the How-To guides should be reviewed. If there is documentation in Github itself, that is what I was looking for, if there are any docs in the Github repo itself (.md) that have these instructions to be changed, those documents should be placed in the list as well. I'll wait until you finish up with the results of your testing. This is the list so far: * How-to Guides * Release Notes  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="33397" issue="22498" author="techwritingwhiz" type="comment" body=" ~dsurnin  I&apos;m just following up on this ticket. Has your team contributed any other items to be reviewed other than just what I have listed above for where these changes might be? Also, is your testing complete? If not, that is fine. I&apos;m just following up since this is on my radar. When you complete that, will you update this ticket and provide further instructions? " created="2017-10-30 22:33:40.0" updateauthor="techwritingwhiz" updated="2017-10-30 22:33:40.0"/>

CDATA For the moment init_indy_node script should be called only once, right after node installed.  After new file structure will be implemented the init_indy_node script must be called once for each network. So every document that mentions init_indy_node script run, should now be changed to something like this * open /etc/indy/indy_config.py * change NETWORK_NAME parameter to desired network * run init_indy_node as before  NOTE: now these steps must be done for each network     ></description> </Issue>

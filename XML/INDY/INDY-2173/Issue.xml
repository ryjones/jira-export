CDATA *Story* As a transaction author, I need my transactions to be written to the ledger preserving me as the author without my needing to accept the responsibilities of an endorser so that I can focus on my business. Instead, I will have a business relationship with an endorser who will endorse my transactions.  *Goals* * It is easy to tell from the ledger who is the endorser and who is the transaction author for each transaction. * A transaction author can use a different transaction endorser for future transactions, including updates to attribs and key rotations. * The transaction must use the author key to sign the transaction author agreement regardless of whether an endorser signature is also needed.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Analyze the work required. * Raise issues for completing the work.  *Notes* * The transaction author field is intended to be used for all future permissions. * The endorser field only needs to be recorded in order to: ** Allow auditability, that the transaction was written with correct permissions ** Allow the network administrator to bill the endorser for the write * Sub-endorsers or chains of endorsers would be desirable for a global network, but are not required at this time. We recognize that in the future adding multiple levels of endorsers or delegated endorsers could be a breaking change. ** Endorsers could be a list, but it would still require the transaction author to know all endorsers at the time the transaction is created. That list could be built off-ledger by sharing a draft transaction. * Suggested user flow: ** Transaction author identifies the need for creating a transaction ** Transaction author identifies which endorser they want to use ** Transaction author includes the DID of the endorser in the transaction, and signs the transaction. ** Transaction author passes the signed transaction to the endorser ** Endorser adds their signature ** Endorser submits the multi-signed transaction to the ledger ** If the endorser will not accept the transaction, and the transaction author wants to try a different endorser, the transaction author must recreate the transaction in order to include the new endorser DID. * Token holders can also choose to "endorse" third party transactions so that they get submitted to the ledger.

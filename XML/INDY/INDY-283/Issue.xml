CDATA Upgrade: Upgrade the pool with demoted nodes. Promote those nodes back into the pool and submit the upgrade again.  *Things tried:*   Case 1: 1. Demote any node. 2. Send POOL_UPGRADE. 3. Promote demoted node. 4. Check upgrade_log and process of upgrade on demoted node.  Result: Demoted node will be upgraded in specified time (or it will be upgraded right after promotion if upgrade time is in the past).  Case 2: 1. Demote any node. 2. Send POOL_UPGRADE. 3. Promote demoted node. 4. Send one more POOL_UPGRADE. 5. Check upgrade_log and process of upgrade on demoted node.  Result: Demoted node will be upgraded in nearest of specified time (or it will be upgraded right after promotion if one of upgrade time is in the past).  *Findings:* Upgrade of demoted node works same way as for not demoted ones. But upgrade and upgrade scheduling looks little strange. It was discussed with developers, INDY-451 was created.  ></description> </Issue>

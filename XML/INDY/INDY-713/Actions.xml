CDATA  ~andkononykhin  found that a number of Jenkins agents were being short of AWS credits during the last week. These were the following agents: * ubuntu-1, * ubuntu-3, * ubuntu-5, * ubuntu-6, * ubuntu-10, * ubuntu-12.  All the failed steps (runs of tests in top-level packages) of builds from the ticket description were executed on the agents ubuntu-01, ubuntu-03, ubuntu-10, ubuntu-12, i.e. only on agents with lack of AWS credits. For all the pull requests, which these builds relate to, later there were builds with the same steps completed successfully. These successful steps were executed on ubuntu-02, ubuntu-07, ubuntu-08, ubuntu-09, i.e. only on agents without lack of AWS credits.  So most likely the accidental test fails on Jenkins were caused by lack of AWS credits on Jenkins agents.   ~andkononykhin  has fixed the issue with lack of AWS credits on agents. However, some time is needed for the agents to accumulate enough credits to provide acceptable performance. Then we will be watching builds on Jenkins for a few days to ensure that this issue was indeed the cause of accidental test fails.  ></body> </Action>

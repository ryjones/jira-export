CDATA It was discussed with more than one engineer to come up with a strategy to clean up our documents folders in our indy repos.  The folder structure for all of the indy repos should look like:   indy-sdk    /docs       /design       /tutorials          /getting-started          /other document....          /other document...       /how-tos     /samples   Within the *docs* folder, there should be a folder for:  * design * tutorials * how-tos  The Getting Started Guides should be moved to the "tutorials" folder.  Each document within each folder should have it's OWN FOLDER. Inside of that document folder, should be the actual document along with any other supporting files that document contains.  ></description> </Issue>

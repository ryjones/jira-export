CDATA  ~andrey.goncharov , I wanted to offer some clarification about Kelly's desire to "see it work in a build."  We need to know that the whole process is working with .deb files from a repo, where the pool upgrade has a real install to run. It wasn't clear in your demo whether any new .deb file got laid down, or if the .deb portion of the work got short-circuited. If the pool_upgrade process you demoed did actually include a .deb distribution and install, then that part of the request is satisfied.  The other success criterion here is that the migration mechanism is the one that ends up getting committed to master as a result of INDY-29. Given when you recorded the demo, and when you and I had some exchanges about your PR, I'm not sure that's the case. Is it?  ></body> </Action>
<Action id="24887" issue="17285" author="danielhardman" type="comment" body="The reason why we are being so careful about this is that having a robust upgrade is the absolute top priority for a build on which we can base the installation of validator nodes for Alpha. If the software is flaky, but we can upgrade it, all is well. But if the upgrade doesn&apos;t work like a charm, we are in serious trouble because we will have to do manual upgrades. Thus, we must be totally confident of this one feature. Please indicate your level of confidence,  ~andrey.goncharov , that the first build after the one with fixes from INDY-29 will upgrade flawlessly–we will use that plus the above criteria to decide if we are truly done." created="2017-06-01 05:03:12.0" updateauthor="danielhardman" updated="2017-06-01 05:03:12.0"/>

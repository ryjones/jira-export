CDATA We need to formalize the architecture plan for Rich Schemas so that we understand how to partition the work so that additional people can accelerate the delivery.  Acceptance Criteria * Investigate the W3C VC standard * Review the existing the work in progress * Create a Plan of Attack (POA) for the remaining work to bring our implementation inline with the standard. ** Define the relationships between the Rich Schema objects ** Should include the work necessary to implement in Indy SDK / LibIndy * Create the relevant issues.  *Notes* * The work necessary to support Rich Schemas in LibVCX will be tracked separately. * The work necessary to support Rich Schemas in Aries Shared Libraries will be tracked separately.  ></description> </Issue>

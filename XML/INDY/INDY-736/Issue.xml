CDATA Build Info: indy-node 1.0.110  Overview: Signature type "CL" should be published only.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Send some SCHEMA. 2. Send CLAIM_DEF with ref of added SCHEMA and signature_type *is not* CL.  Actual Results: The claim definition was published to the Sovrin distributed ledger.  Expected Results: CLAIM_DEFs with signature_type CL should be published only (we can't GET_CLAIM_DEF with other than CL signature_type cause it is not supported).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA Can we crash the service? Can we run out of memory?   ~krw910  - Can you provide more details?   ~ckochenower  guesses that this would be an external process that would utilize a great deal of memory after inducing catchup (i.e. stop node, generate load, start node) which should cause increased virtual memory usage, paging, and swapping perhaps to the point of "thrashing". Will the indy-node service crash or become completely unresponsive?  ></description> </Issue>

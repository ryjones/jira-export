CDATA  ~stevetolman , {{test_link_has_requested_proofs}} must check the functionality concerning {{proofRequests}} field of {{sovrin_client.client.wallet.link.Link}} class. This field is absent in the current implementation. However, the functionality of creation and sending proofs in reply to proof requests has been implemented and there is a test checking it ({{testAliceSendClaimProofToAcme}}) which passes now on master branch.  So it is not critical not to have {{test_link_has_requested_proofs}} completed for Minimal Go-Live.  ></body> </Action>

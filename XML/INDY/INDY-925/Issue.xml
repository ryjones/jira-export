CDATA When CLI is being started for the first time (per user) after the rebranding upgrade the migration mechanism must check whether the current user's home directory contains {{.sovrin}} subdirectory. If the user's home directory contain {{.sovrin}} subdirectory, then the migration mechanism must offer the user to migrate this data. If the user agrees then the application data must be migrated from {{.sovrin}} subdirectory to {{.indy}} subdirectory and the former must be kept as a backup.  See comments to INDY-830 for details on migration for client.  *UPD:* In scope of this task a client migration for the indy-node version that supports multiple pool networks (see INDY-832, INDY-833 for details) must also be implemented. This client migration may be combined with the client migration for the rebranded indy-node version (because both rebranding and multiple pool networks support will be introduced simultaneously in the upcoming stable indy-node version).  ></description> </Issue>

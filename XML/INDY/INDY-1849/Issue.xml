CDATA During log analizing from INDY-1835 was found a bug, which associated with batch handling. There is a lot of errors in logs, like "discard batch "<some message>" because Expected object or value", that means, that error was raised on string 'pi' or 'po' serialization. In this case, all batch will be discarded with some other messages inside, like Propogate, for example.  *Acceptance criteria:* * Investigate 'batch creation' related source code * Write unit and integration tests, which emulate error raising * Create a fix for avoiding this error and normal batch handling  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA The workflow of catch-up being initiated by this trigger is wrong: a catch-up initiated in such the way is started from the ledger which the received newer ledger status belongs to - so not all ledgers may eventually catch up.  Also it seems that this catch-up trigger is redundant because we have another catch-up trigger - the checkpoint-based one - for the case if a ledger lags behind from the ledgers on other nodes.  In scope of this task we should remove ledger status based catch-up trigger and eliminate the related wrong catch-up workflow.  ></description> </Issue>

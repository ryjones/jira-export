CDATA install client and node in one machine from rc repo;  run 4 nodes locally as described  https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-node/blob/master/docs/Sovrin_Running_Locally.md ;  on running node1 delete pool ledger file   ~.sovrin/data/nodes/Node1/pool_transactions_sandbox/1  stop and rerun node1;  poll ledger file created with zero length;  node1 writes lots of ignore messages to the log;  run load_test.py;  it finishes ok;  however node1 writes preprepare and commit messages to log;        It needs to be validated, but it looks like the node1 cannot send messages to the other nodes, but receives commits.  ></description> </Issue>

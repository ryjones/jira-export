CDATA *Story* As a developer or QA analyzing load test results, I need to have all common errors and exception already grepped and reported, so that I can understand faster what's going on.  It would save a lot of time if load script automation could grep all common errors and exception in logs (each Node logs and journalctl).  Â   *Acceptance criteria*  The result of load tests need to have the following information (as a report): * How many transactions have been written on every node * How many transaction expected to be written (from the load script point of view) * How many view changes happened * Graphs from each nodes * Metrics summary from each node (`get_metrics` output) * Get validator info result from each node * Journalctk analysis: ** output all exceptions (if any) * Logs analysis: ** All ERROR log messages ** The following patterns: *** `blacklisting` *** `invalid BLS signature` *** `request digest is incorrect` *** `has incorrect digest` *** `time not acceptable` *** `incorrect state trie root` *** `incorrect transaction tree root` *** `has incorrect reject` *** `error in plugin field` *** `incorrect audit ledger` *** <to be continued......>  ></description> </Issue>

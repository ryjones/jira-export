CDATA h6. BUILD  sovrin-node 0.3.161 sovrin-client 0.3.150  h6. SUMMARY * In current implementation after typing _help_ tips mentioned below appear. _node_ tip is unnecessary because there is no command starting from _node_ word. ** status ** new ** node ** client * Probably list with tips can contain more commands. On the other hand it can be empty by default but when user starts typing first letters of command all commands that are started from these letters will appear in the list. * When user types anything after _help_ word (ex. "help a") list with 2 tips (_help_, _status_) appears. It's redundant. Probably real possible for entering word can appear (ex. list with words _proofreq_, _proof_ appears after typing _send_)  ></description> </Issue>

If node will do real reordering, then it can try to apply old PrePrepare (with PrePrepare time more then 10 minutes for now) and will raise suspicious and as result will stop reordering and order process in current view too. To avoid this situation we should turn off time checking while reordering after view change." priority="3" status="10200" created="2020-01-28 14:20:49.0" updated="2020-01-28 14:20:49.0" votes="0" watches="1" workflowId="58060" archived="N"/>

CDATA Problem reason:  - view change was broken because of recent protocol changes (batches, state)  Changes:  - a primary is now selected in a round-robin fashion instead of Election protocol - we use catch-up to synchronize states during view change - some bugs in catch-up were fixed  Build: We have a build (created manually) from a simple-election branch: - `sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.evernym.com/deb xenial simple-election"` - `sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial simple-election"`  Risk factors: - View change - Load testing  Risk: - Medium+  Covered with tests: - https://github.com/evernym/plenum/tree/simple-election/plenum/test/view_change - https://github.com/evernym/plenum/tree/simple-election/plenum/test/primary_selection - https://github.com/evernym/plenum/tree/simple-election/plenum/test/view_change/slow_nodes - https://github.com/evernym/plenum/tree/simple-election/plenum/test/node_catchup  Recommendations for QA (optional): - run a load test - check that even if a view change is don,e we can still process handling requests  ></body> </Action>

However this ticket was to change how &quot;view change&quot; was handled. I have verified that we are no longer going through an election process, but we are indeed using a round robin approach. So I am closing this ticket and we will write new tickets for any issues that come from the change." created="2017-07-18 03:41:50.0" updateauthor="krw910" updated="2017-07-18 03:41:50.0"/>

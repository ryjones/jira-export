CDATA  ~SeanBohan_Sovrin , Yes, my user is default TRUSTEE. Yes, you are correct about the version, but we don't validate it for existence. The only validation for version is that it is greater than or equal to current one.  I tried cancel of upgrade. If I will change action=cancel to action=start, upgrade will be successfully scheduled.  I just copied wrong transaction with action=cancel instead of action=start and I was not able to find my mistake for a long time because of wrong message. It says that TRUSTEE can't schedule upgrade (but actually he can) when the problem is that I'm trying to cancel not existing upgrade.  ></body> </Action>

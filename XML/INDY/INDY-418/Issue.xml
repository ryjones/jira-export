CDATA  To be able to issue a pool upgrade a person first needs to create a schedule which requires python skills**  You need to download the contents of this page:  Pool Upgrade Schedule Generator| https://gist.github.com/lovesh/56b947b051f55619f2885feb09354b47 ,  then fix some typos in the script becuase is its coded for display so has some unnecessary characters.  Then you need to figure out the ID's for all your Nodes and that takes some effort.  Change the script to code these IDS into it  Run the script take the output and and within a short time fire it on the Sovrin CLI or the schedule becomes stale and does not work.  This is a Usability nightmare. Needs fixing for sure.        ></description> </Issue>

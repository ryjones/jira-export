CDATA *Environment:* indy-node 1.6.70  *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 25 nodes with version 1.3.62. 2. On one of the nodes change rc repo to master to get upgrade failed on this node (node 25 in attached logs). 3. Schedule upgrade to 1.6.70 version. => Upgrade was happened on all nodes exclude Node25 (because the version was not fount in master repo) and Node7 (because of INDY-1447). 4. Perform manual upgrade on nodes 25 and 7.  *Actual Results:* Upgrade log was rewritten, record about failed upgrade (at 14:35) was lost, new records about this upgrade appeared, upgrade was happened.  *Expected Results:* Upgrade log should not be affected by manual upgrade the node. Failed upgrade should not be re-scheduled and should not happen.  Some logs were collected after 1 day of load and they are too big for attachment. All logs are placed here: s3://qanodelogs/indy-1584/NodeXX.7z To get logs, run following command on log processor machine:  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://qanodelogs/indy-1584/ /home/ev/logs/indy-1584/  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *PoA* * Once message is ordered, OrdererService needs to do the following:  ** Call `WriteRequestManager#commit_batch` (for master replica only) ** Send `Ordered` message to the Internal Bus *** The `Ordered` message will be processed by MonitorService, Node (Propagate) Service, and ObservablerService *** Monitor service will update statistics *** Node (Propagate) Service will send Reply to the client and mark requests as executed *** Observable Service will update Observers if needed\ *** See  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/master/design/plenum_2_0_architecture_object.png  * What is stated above effectively replaces `processOrdered` message in Node * So, the following needs to be done right now: ** `WriteRequestManager#commit_batch` will be called by the OrdererService, not Node  ></body> </Action>

CDATA ZMQ (and hence Indy-Node) can not drop client connections from the server side if the client doesnâ€™t close it on her side. # https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1087 # https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1252 # https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2877 So, If there are a lot of open connections from clients to pool, then the pool will not be able to accept any new clients/connections.  We need to define firewall rules (use iptables as a reference) to somehow deal with open connections problem. A possible problem is that Stewards can use any firewalls. But we should at least give some recommendations and get them aware of the issue.  *Acceptance criteria* # Instructions for Stewards # Rules for iptables (or other firewall).   ></description> </Issue>

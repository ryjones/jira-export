Does a client have to actually talked to a node when sending the upgrade transaction or is it propagated to all nodes?  	It is propagated to all nodes (in one of the test cases config_transactions ledger wrote upgrade tnx that was sent with all nodes stopped when consensus was reached).  > 2. Does the config_transactions ledger sync with all nodes in the pool?  	Yes, if pool has consensus (e.g. if 3 nodes of 4 have the same upgrade txn in this ledger then 4th node get them as well after start). !Screenshot.PNG|thumbnail!   ></body> </Action>

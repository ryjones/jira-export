CDATA We ran into an issue where the only machine in the pool that did not upgrade was also the only machine in the pool where the port to the client is blocked. The node only talks to the other validator nodes and does not allow traffic from a client.  Two questions to research 1. Does a client have to actually talked to a node when sending the upgrade transaction or is it propagated to all nodes?  2. Does the config_transactions ledger sync with all nodes in the pool?  ></description> </Issue>

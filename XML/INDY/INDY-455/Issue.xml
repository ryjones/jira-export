CDATA If a Primary is re-started,  and the view is not changed, then the Primary may not be able to send checkpoints correctly.  How to reproduce: - Have 3 nodes - Stop the Primary - Re-start the Primary. Since we had only 2 active nodes, view is not changed (not enough InstanceChange for consensus) - Start sending txns  The re-started Primary is able to send txns due to the fix in INDY-334, but checkpoint logic may be broken since it would have lost checkpoints. Also h and H should be set accordingly.   ></description> </Issue>

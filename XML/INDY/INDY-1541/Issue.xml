CDATA Demote a single backup primary (replica) and the primary. Expect the next replica to become the primary and the next node in the round robin to become a new replica.  Start a 10 validator node pool with the following Primary and Replica configuration: Node1:0 - Primary Node2:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if node 1 goes down or a view change is requested) Node3:2 - Backup to node 2 Node4:3 - Backup to node 3  Take down Node4 and the primary (Node1) and expect Node2 to become the new primary and Node5 to become a new replica.  The result being:  Node2:0 - Primary Node3:1 - Next in line for primary (backup if node 2 goes down or a view change is requested) Node5:2 - Backup to node 3 Node6:3 - Backup to node 5  ></description> </Issue>

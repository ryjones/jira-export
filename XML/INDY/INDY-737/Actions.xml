<Action id="30030" issue="20243" author="vladimirwork" type="comment" body=" ~krw910  According to discussion with  ~ashcherbakov , &quot;origin&quot; parameter is a DID of user that owns CLAIM_DEF (it exists in code and sets as DID of current key implicitly when we execute GET_CLAIM_DEF command). So if I add CLAIM_DEF as DID1 and try to get it as DID2 I get message that claim def is not found and vice versa so now we have an issue that each DID can see its own claim defs only (even if this DID is Trustee/Steward or another privileged user) and it&apos;s wrong because we should be able to see all published claim defs as any user (or as any priveleged user at least?)." created="2017-08-21 07:28:51.0" updateauthor="vladimirwork" updated="2017-08-21 07:29:15.0"/>

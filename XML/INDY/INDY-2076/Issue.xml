CDATA Currently indy-node CD pipeline defines set of custom packages that builds itself that prevents unnecessary builds when the packages are already published.  indy-plenum is not built in scope indy-node pipeline but is also required during promotion logic from latest repos. There is an API in jenkins library to skip promotion if not necessary that requires to specify list of packages that are expected.  Need to adjust CD pipeline to make possible such a skipping logic when possible.  Requirement: * indy-plenum should be specified with exact expected version * version of plenum shouldn't be specified directly in CD pipeline to avoid unnecessary maintenance (version bumping)  ></description> </Issue>

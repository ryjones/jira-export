CDATA Changes: * Track primaries in each view * Add Primaries to PrePrepare * Restore primaries from the audit ledger if the replica hasn't ordered anything in the given view yet * Restore primaries from the PrePrepare if the replica hasn't ordered anything in the given view yet and the batch is not on audit yet (this means this is re-ordering so we can trust prepared PrePrepares)  PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1381  Build: 1.11.0.dev1123  Recommendation for QA: - unit and integrations tests are there - it's hard to reproduce it in system tests, so just run a load test  ></body> </Action>

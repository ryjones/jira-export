CDATA * TestMultiSigSuite.py: test_case_sign_and_multisign relies on old libindy logic which allowed to combine single and multi signs for one message. Need to use some raw APIs as workaround to make wrongly signed request * test_upgrade.py: need to fix helpers to provide an ability to dynamically build necessary docker environment, in particular need to have pool with old version of Node installed to test the upgrade from  that version (seems that it's blocked by INDY-2125)  ></description> </Issue>

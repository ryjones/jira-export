CDATA Our document writer found an issue that needs to be verified. While running through the Getting Started Tutorial she noticed we use the command ping to verify connection to the agents. The instructions do not have you ping 'Acme Corp', but she tried it.  When she ran 'ping Acme Corp' her active wallet was deleted. We need to verify this issue and log a bug if one is found.  ></description> </Issue>

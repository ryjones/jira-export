CDATA Now that  security advisories are supported in github| https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/managing-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-project  , we would like to switch from Jira to GitHub issues for Indy.  For those with github maintainer capabilties, please update the settings in GitHub to activate issues.  As well, someone (I can take it on) needs to do a PR to update the "Contributors" guidelines to cover that github issues should be used for issues, that Jira has history and that the security features are used by maintainers to track vulnerabilities.   ~esplinr  - can you help with the activation step?  ></description> </Issue>

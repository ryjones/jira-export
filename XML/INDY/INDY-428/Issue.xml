CDATA I was given a new pool of machines to use.  I started all the nodes and everything seemed to run fine.  I was trying to find the primary node and when I ran "grep "selected primary" *.log" on each of the nodes.  I noticed the query on Node 3 did not return anything (Node 3 is in the eu-west-1-ireland region).  When I looked in the log, I see this error 3 times. {code:java} 2017-07-14 17:19:39,906 | INFO     | primary_selector.py  ( 255) | _startSelection | Node3 cannot start primary selection since mode is 300 {code}  The log for Node 3 is attached.  I also attached the log from Node 2 for comparison.  ></description> </Issue>

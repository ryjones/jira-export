CDATA *Story* As a user of an Indy network that does not require fees for writes, I want my writes to the global ledger to be sponsored by a trust anchor who prevents spam, but I want to retain future control of my writes so that I can modify my writes or work with a different trust anchor in the future.  *Acceptance Criteria* * Create a plan for effectively using trust anchors to sponsor writes to the ledger * Get architectural review of the plan * Create the necessary issues  Goals: * A trust anchor can write a cred def that is owned by a third party * The owner can modify that cred def * A trust anchor can write a schema def that is owned by a third party * The owner can modify that schema def  ></description> </Issue>

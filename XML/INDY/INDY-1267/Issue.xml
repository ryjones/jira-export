CDATA *Story*  As a Product Manager of Indy Node, I need a list of all the log messages so that I can review them holistically.  *Acceptance Criteria*  Produce a spreadsheet containing all the logging strings from Indy. It will have the columns: * "Current Message" * "Log Level"  We will add columns for "Revised Message", "Revised Level".  A member of the development team will review the messages and include proposed revisions. * Reviewer can suggest a Revised Message or Revised Level, can mark level as "None" if the log message is unnecessary, or leave Revised Message and Revised Level blank if no changes are needed. * If there is a "Revised Message" but the "Current Message" is empty, then the log messages is new and should be added to the product.  The spreadsheet should be delivered to Product Management and a representative of the Operations Team to review the strings.  ></description> </Issue>

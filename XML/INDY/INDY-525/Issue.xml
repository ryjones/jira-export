While this is technically Python, it really shouldn&apos;t be residing in this location. It is not obvious to anyone, nor does it follow any of the standard configuration file locations.On a Linux system, I would expect to find the configuration file in an {{etc/}} directory. I do know there is the possibility of creating another configuration file in {{.sovrin}}, but it&apos;s not clear which takes precedence.This does bring up the question of whether or not code-as-configuration is a good idea, but that&apos;s probably best served as a separate topic." priority="3" resolution="10000" status="10001" created="2017-08-02 09:27:09.0" updated="2019-03-29 20:33:58.0" resolutiondate="2019-03-29 20:33:58.0" votes="0" watches="2" workflowId="19713"/>

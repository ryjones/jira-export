CDATA If upgrade from version X to Y fails, it tries to roll-back everything by performing downgrade to version X.  If there is a dependency (not indy one, but,for example, base58), so that X depends on version Z1, and Y depends on version Z2,Â  then downgrade fails since Z1 is not listed explicitly during downgrade (apt can't install old earlier version of a dependency if there is a newer one in the repo).  *Acceptance criteria* * Downgrade and roll-back should be possible * If a dependency version changed, then it should properly take it into account and downgrade the dependency explicitly.  ></description> </Issue>

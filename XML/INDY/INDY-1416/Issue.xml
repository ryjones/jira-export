CDATA *Story*  As an administrator of an Indy node, I want log messages to be clear and well written.  *Acceptance Criteria*  Log messages that have been reviewed by Product Management and the Operations Team should be incorporated into the product.  Log messages and levels in the product should match the Revised Message and Revised Level in the spreadsheet. If the revised level is "None" then the log message is unnecessary. Blank revisions means that no changes are needed.  If there is a "Revised Message" but the "Current Message" is empty, then the log messages is new and should be added to the product.  ></description> </Issue>

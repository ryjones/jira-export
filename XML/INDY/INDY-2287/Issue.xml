CDATA There are 2 issues with the VeridiumIDC node on MainNet that need to be debugged.  *The first issue:* This may be related to issues we are seeing on about 4 other nodes on the three Sovrin networks, so it may be becoming prevalent enough that it is becoming a serious issue. The issue is that the node is not maintaining consensus with the network. In the attached logs the indy-node service was restarted at about 16:15 and was in consensus following the restart. An ATTRIB transaction was written to the ledger 5 or 10 minutes later, at which point consensus was lost.  All settings and configuration on the node appear to be correct. I am linking this ticket to another that appears to have similar symptoms in INDY. It also appears related to this Sovrin ticket:  https://sovrin.atlassian.net/browse/SN-8 . I am attaching logs, local output of validator-info, and files from the data directory. I will also include files from ev1, which is the primary on MainNet.     *The second issue:* All attempts to get-validator-info remotely are failing, whether from indy-cli or from a custom script. The client port is reachable by TCP from clients, and it appears that the zmq protocol is not blocked. The other validator nodes are able to communicate on the node port. In short, I believe that the communication pathways are clear, and that the issue may be a failure while gathering the metrics. That being said, the validator-info command run locally from the command line is functioning properly.     ></description> </Issue>

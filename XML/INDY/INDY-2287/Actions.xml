CDATA *For the second issue* VeridiumIDC didn't receive any client messages. So, clients are not connected to VeridiumIDC. Maybe a problem in different ip addresses. In the NODE transaction "client_ip": "18.197.183.58" and on the node "Client_ip": 10.0.50.26 But maybe it's ok for specific VeridiumIDC interfaces.  ></body> </Action>

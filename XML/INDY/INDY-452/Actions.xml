CDATA  ~esplinr  Currently all in a read-only mode Nodes reject all requests from clients. However, if a (malicious) Primary sends a Batch with requests to be ordered, it will be ordered. Freshness batches will be ordered as well.  Since the main purpose of a "big red button" (INDY-360) as a protection against external attacks (from the clients mostly) has been implemented, and the chances of malicious Primary doing this kind of attacks mentioned above are pretty low, we are going to Won't Do the ticket. If there is a malicious Primary doing DDoS attack, we can detect and prevent it by other means as well (whitelisting, firewall protection, etc.) even more efficiently then pushing a big red button. With a firewall rule we can exclude (block) just the malicious primary, so that view change happens and the pool will be able to continue ordering, while the Big Red button will prevent the whole pool from ordering regardless of who is the Primary. Also the read only state will not prevent DDoS by just PrePrepares (even though they will be discarded, they still be sent).   ></body> </Action>

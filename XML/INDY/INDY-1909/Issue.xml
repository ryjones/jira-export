CDATA *Acceptance criteria* * Tests should be written that confirm that old enough INSTANCE_CHANGE messages are discarded * Accumulated INSTANCE_CHANGE messages should be discarded based on some configurable timeout * Also it should be possible to turn of this functionality from config file  *Additional notes* * This won't totally prevent incidents like INDY-1903, just reduce probability of such situation * This can potentially introduce other failure modes * Most probably this should be turned off when proper fix is delivered * Main reason why this task exists is because it's one of the simplest and fastest ways to significantly reduce chance of incidents like INDY-1903  ></description> </Issue>

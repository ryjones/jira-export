CDATA We ought to refuse to start if there is less than a certain amount or percentage of available disk space (1GB?)  We should exit gracefully if we hit this condition and we should check for it on an ongoing basis and not crash unpredictably.Â   ></body> </Action>

CDATA We expect the out of disk space condition is handled by the system administrators using other means.

CDATA indy-node 1.3.440 docker pool 4 + 1 nodes  ></environment> <description><! CDATA *Steps to Reproduce:* 1. Setup the pool of 4 nodes. 2. Add one more node: 2.1. Copy genesis files from active nodes to additional one. 2.2. Run `sudo su - indy -c "init_indy_node Node5 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 000000000000000000000000000node5"`. 2.3. Start and enable indy-node. 2.4. Send node txn using indy-cli: `ledger node target=4Tn3wZMNCvhSTXPcLinQDnHyj56DTLQtL61ki4jo2Loc client_port=9702 client_ip=10.0.0.6 alias=Node5 node_ip=10.0.0.6 node_port=9701 services=VALIDATOR blskey=2RdajPq6rCidK5gQbMzSJo1NfBMYiS3e44GxjTqZUk3RhBdtF28qEABHRo4MgHS2hwekoLWRTza9XiGEMRCompeujWpX85MPt87WdbTMysXZfb7J1ZXUEMrtE5aZahfx6p2YdhZdrArFvTmFWdojaD2V5SuvuaQL4G92anZ1yteay3R` => Processing of missed batches was not happened on added node. 3. Send new txn.  *Actual Results:* Domain ledger size on added node is still 9 (genesis txns only).  *Expected Results:* Added node should complete processing of missed batches and should work.  *Additional Information:* 1. Genesis files are the same as on all nodes (md5sum of all genesis files are the same). The only difference is that 10.0.0.6 was used as node and client IP in init_indy_node instead of usual 0.0.0.0, but this configuration works (this issue was not reproduced second time with the same configuration). 2. After described steps node was demoted in order to have only working nodes in the pool. After that one node was stopped to check that catch up basically works, after that pool stopped working by some reason (as far as I understand, we should be still in consensus).  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA A Steward needs to have the ability to demote and promote their own node. The use case is if a Steward knows they will be down for maintenance and they want to remove their node from the pool so it does not count as a failed node during down time.  The current process of removing a node from the pool is to send the following command {code} send NODE dest=<NODE ID> data={'alias': '<node name>', 'services':   } {code}  Currently only a Trustee has the permissions to perform this action.  To add promote the node back into the pool the Steward would need to be able to send the following command {code} send NODE dest=<NODE ID> data={'alias': '<node name>', 'services':  'VALIDATOR' } {code}  ></description> </Issue>

CDATA *Summary*  We need to implement property-based tests for the new View Changer.   Original PBFT paper assumes that same batches can be ordered on different nodes with different views. However since we write batch parameters to audit ledger it can diverge on different nodes after view change, which is a big problem.  There could be different solutions to this problem, the most promising idea is not to increase view no of batches that came from old view, and probably add some flag to them. However this is a serious deviation from original protocol and should be analyzed thoroughly.  *Acceptance criteria* * protocol update should be designed and proved to be safe * proof should be confirmed by randomized simulation tests   ></description> </Issue>

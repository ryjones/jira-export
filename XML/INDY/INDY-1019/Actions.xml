CDATA Problem reason:  We need to integrate tests of node_request folder with libindy client   Changes:  - tests were integrated and their behaviour stayed the same  little changes to pool_transaction folder: additional "sdk_" fixtures and functions which have been used in node_request   PR:   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/525    Version:  master, 257   Risk factors:  No   Risk:  Low   Covered with tests:  No   Recommendations for QA  the only noticed problem is versioning.

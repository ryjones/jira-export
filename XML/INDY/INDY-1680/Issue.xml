CDATA If a backup primary node is malicious (for example, disconnected), all replicas on this backup instance store all new requests and other replicas can't remove already ordered messages. For solve this problem we should have ability to switch off (remove) replicas with no changes value F:     *Acceptance criteria* - add function to remove a replica (and cleaning client requests for this replica) - It should not lead to change of F value - re-evaluate requests queue once replica is removed to check if we can clear some requests - correctly process messages for switched off replicas ** discarding them may be fine for this version - make sure monitor works as expected - add tests for check this function and check the correct work of other systems (like a monitor, requests removing)  ></description> </Issue>

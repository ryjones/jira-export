CDATA When Monitor calculates throughput and latency for master, it takes into account only valid requests, that is requests passing dynamic validation. But non-master instances don't have dynamic validation, so all requests are taken into account there.  It may lead to false-positive View Changes since backup instances will think that master degraded, while it just had a lot of invalid requests.  *Acceptance criteria:* * Include information about all requests into Ordered message * Pass all requests into Monitor * Take only valid requests when processing Ordered message on Node.  Can be done together with INDY-1642 to take into account a new PrePrepare format.  ></description> </Issue>

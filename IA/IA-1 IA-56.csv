*Acceptance Criteria*
* Code is made part of public repositories in the Indy project.
*  A binary package exists which can be executed with ""java -jar cloudagent.jar""
* The process runs a single cloud agent which can communicate with an open source edge agent such as the [Sovrin Connector App|https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/]
* It includes manual build scripts sufficient for developers to work on the code base.
* It runs on Ubuntu Linux 16.04
* Unit tests are included and can be manually executed by a developer.
* Unit tests pass.
* JIRA issues exist that document open issues and key decisions regarding what we did and what we decided not to do.
* An architectural overview document, including an FAQ, is included in the code repository.
* A CI / CD pipeline is running on Hyperledger infrastructure that builds and executes the unit tests.

*Notes*
* The open source cloud agent needs to be sufficient for a technical person to run an agent for themselves on their own equipment.
* It is expected to be implemented in Scala.
* When agents are communicating with other agents, it is assumed that a mediator could be routing the messages.

* The agent to agent protocol is documented in a series of HIPEs: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IA-52,IA-54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Please add high level design or a link to the design),Unset,Unset,Unset,,IA-49,,,No,,Unset,No,,,"1|i0022n:",,,,Unset,Unset,,(Please add steps to reproduce),,Unset,,,,,,Unset,,Unset,,(Please add usage information),esplinr,,,,,,"18/Sep/19 11:42 PM;esplinr;BC.gov contributed their VON agent as the Aries-Cloud-Agent-Python (ACA-py), removing the need for this effort by Evernym.;;;",,,

As a developer of solutions in an Indy ecosystem, I want to use an open source edge agent to do claims exchange with agents that use the Reference Cloud Agent so that my solution is compatible with other agents in the ecosystem.

The predominant open source mobile edge agent is the Sovrin Connector App: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/

*Acceptance Criteria*
* The tests of the Sovrin Connector App can be run with against the Reference Cloud Agent

Excluded:
* These components don't have to use the Agent 2 Agent protocol. That will be future work (IA-53)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IA-52,,,,,,IA-53,,,,,,,,,,(Please add high level design or a link to the design),Unset,Unset,Unset,,IA-49,,,No,,Unset,No,,,"1|i0022v:",,,,Unset,Unset,,(Please add steps to reproduce),,Unset,,,,,,Unset,,Unset,,(Please add usage information),esplinr,,,,,,"18/Sep/19 11:40 PM;esplinr;BC.gov contributed their VON agent as the Aries-Cloud-Agent-Python (ACA-py), removing the need for this effort by Evernym.;;;",,,

As an administrator maintaining a reference cloud agent, I want to use open source components to administer my deployment rather than having to subscribe to AWS Dynamo DB.

*Acceptance Criteria*
* The reference cloud agent can be configured to use an open source key-value store, such as Cassandra or MongoDB.

*Notes*
* An alternative implementation would be for it to manage it's key-value store in the same storage as the wallet, but that likely would take a lot of work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Please add high level design or a link to the design),Unset,Unset,Unset,,IA-49,,,No,,Unset,No,,,"1|i00233:",,,,Unset,Unset,,(Please add steps to reproduce),,Unset,,,,,,Unset,,Unset,,(Please add usage information),esplinr,,,,,,"18/Sep/19 11:42 PM;esplinr;BC.gov contributed their VON agent as the Aries-Cloud-Agent-Python (ACA-py), removing the need for this effort by Evernym.;;;",,,

A short introduction is included below, with a much more detailed design explanation is included in the ""Design"" section.

We're currently thinking this will exist as a separate package, i.e. in addition to fabric-shim and fabric-contract-api and therefore will live in a top level directory alongside those other apis. However the placement of this work may be reviewed as we iteratively deliver new functionality and test importing it, from a user's perspective.

Introduction

-------------

A typical sequence is for an application to connect to a peer (the 'gateway' into the network channel), and obtain a reference to a smart contract. The Network-shared transaction logic in the Smart Contract is then be invoked by name, and with optional data arguments and return values. The data arguments can include transient data if needed. The logic in the Smart Contract will typical reference and update the shared transaction data, subject of course to exactly how the code is written.

The 'Ledger' is, therefore, a primary abstraction in a blockchain system, including in Hyperledger Fabric; this abstraction allows the concepts of states, world state, collections, transactions, blocks etc. to be tied together and formalised.",,heatherp,,,,,,,,,,,,FABCJ-3,FABCN-358,,,,,"A very good high-level design summary is here:

"Update Fabric Chaincode vendoring docs to include usage of ""go mod vendor""",FABCAG-28,39878,Documentation,Backlog,FABCAG,Fabric Contract API Go,software,awjh-ibm,,,Medium,,mbwhite,medikent,medikent,17/May/19 5:14 AM,18/Nov/20 8:12 PM,28/Oct/23 2:26 AM,,,0,cc-triaged,external,,"The existing docs do not state that *go mod vendor* is a way to vendor dependencies for projects running on go1.11+. I suggest adding language like the following:



*_Go mod vendor_* is the simplest way to vendor dependencies for a given chaincode when you need to use a Go library not a part of the standard Golang libraries nor a part of the Hyperledger Fabric standard libraries. The *fabric-tools* container image typically used to install chaincode on a Fabric network comes packaged with the Golang standard libraries and the Hyperledger Fabric standard libraries available on the GOPATH. Since no other dependencies are available by default in the *fabric-tools* image then vendoring dependencies must be done in order to use the *fabric-tools* image to build chaincode depending on libraries not present by default in the *fabric-tools* image.

When using Golang 1.11+ follow this simple process to vendor dependencies for chaincode:
 # Write chaincode that uses libraries requiring vendoring
 # Run _*go mod init*_ __ in the directory. This should create the *go.mod* and *go.sum* files.
 # Run _*go mod vendor*_ __ in the directory. This should create the *vendor* directory with a copy of all the versions of packages the chaincode depends on which correspond to the versions contained in the *go.sum* file.
 # Mount the entire directory into a *fabric-tools* container and run _*peer chaincode install ...*_ __ with the appropriate command line options.",,lesleyannj,medikent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Please add high level design or a link to the design),Unset,Unset,Unset,,,,,No,,Unset,No,,,"1|hzwrme:i009",,,,Unset,Unset,5 June to 12 June,15 June to 19 June,19 June to 26 June,29 Jun to 6 Jul,3 Jul to 10 Jul,10 Jul to 24 Jul,23 Jul to 7 Aug,7 Aug to 14 Aug,(Please add steps to reproduce),,Unset,,,,,,Unset,,Unset,,(Please add usage information),lesleyannj,medikent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"08/Jun/20 10:15 PM;lesleyannj;[~senthilkumarr] or you actively working on this ticket?

 I have next code:

 ""github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/contractapi""

type SmartContract struct {

I can successfully add new asset to chaincode, but when I try to read from chaincode with
{code:java}
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n fabcar -c '{""Args"":[""Get,""1""]}'{code}
I get next error
{code:java}
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:""Error handling success response. Value did not match schema:\n1. return.B: Invalid type. Expected: array, given: string""


{code}
But if I replace type of B to string array or int array, I don`t get such error. So it looks like that there is unnecessary conversion of byte array to string.

Is there a way to fix it without replacing type from byte array? Or it is some bug with conversion?

and call it on the peer
